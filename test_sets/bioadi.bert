methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphon	MAFP	A specific human lysophospholipase: cDNA cloning, tissue distribution and kinetic characterization. Lysophospholipases are critical enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids; increased levels of lysophospholipids are associated with a host of diseases. Herein we report the cDNA cloning of a human brain 25 kDa lysophospholipid-specific lysophospholipase (hLysoPLA). The enzyme (at both mRNA and protein levels) is widely distributed in tissues, but with quite different abundances. The hLysoPLA hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine in both monomeric and micellar forms, and exhibits apparent cooperativity and surface dilution kinetics, but not interfacial activation. Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the hLysoPLA binds first to the micellar surface and then to the substrate presented on the surface. The kinetic parameters associated with this surface dilution kinetic model are reported, and it is concluded that hLysoPLA has a single substrate binding site and a surface recognition site. The apparent cooperativity observed is likely due to the change of substrate presentation. In contrast to many non-specific lipolytic enzymes that exhibit lysophospholipase activity, hLysoPLA hydrolyzes only lysophospholipids and has no other significant enzymatic activity. Of special interest, hLysoPLA does not act on plasmenylcholine. Of the several inhibitors tested, only methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) potently and irreversibly inhibits the enzymatic activity. The inhibition by MAFP is consistent with the catalytic mechanism proposed for the enzyme - a serine hydrolase with a catalytic triad composed of Ser-119, Asp-174 and His-208.
insulin receptor related	IRR	Cloning and sequencing of the complete cDNA encoding the human insulin receptor related receptor. The insulin receptor related receptor (IRR) is a heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The IRR shares large homology with the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) receptor with regard to amino acid sequence and protein structure. So far, only a partial human sequence containing the complete 3' end has been reported, although the full-length human IRR cDNA had been used for transfection studies and functional analysis of the receptor. We have isolated a full-length human IRR cDNA and report on the 5' translated and untranslated region of the human IRR gene. The full length IRR sequence contains 4150 bases and shares a high degree of homology with the guinea pig IRR cDNA sequence and rat IRR sequences that had been reported earlier on by others. Sequencing of the IRR cDNA revealed that the human IRR cDNA contains 341 bases corresponding to the IRR 5' end in addition to the bases that had been reported on before. Also, this sequence contains the start codon of translation. The full length cDNA for the human IRR can now be used for functional expression studies and to elucidate the nature of the ligand for this receptor type.
renal na + / phosphate cotransport	NPT	Isolation and chromosomal mapping of a novel human gene showing homology to Na+/PO4 cotransporter. We isolated a cDNA clone which shows a significant similarity with the renal Na+/phosphate cotransporter (NPT) from a human intestine mucosa cDNA library. The cDNA is 2626 bases long, with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 497 amino acids. The deduced amino acids sequence shows an overall homology of 48% with the human renal NPT1 protein. This gene is expressed in intestine, colon, liver, and pancreas. Thus, this gene may code for intestinal type NPT or closely related proteins. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on the chromosome 6p21.3-p22 region by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with both a human/rodent mono-chromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.
progenitor - derived immature dendritic	DCs	Cutting edge: immature dendritic cells generated from monocytes in the presence of TGF-beta 1 express functional C-C chemokine receptor 6. Although CD34+ progenitor-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) express CCR6, several recent studies reported that monocyte-derived immature DCs do not do so. We observed that DCs generated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TGF-beta 1 consistently responded to liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha). These immature DCs expressed one class of high-affinity binding sites for LARC, and expressed both CCR6 mRNA and protein. Therefore, LARC-CCR6 interaction presumably also contributes to the regulation of trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs, and utilization of TGF-beta can potentially provide a ready source of CCR6+ monocyte-derived DCs for therapeutic purposes.

None	V	A common polymorphic allele of the human luteinizing hormone beta-subunit gene: additional mutations and differential function of the promoter sequence. A common genetic variant (V) of the human luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunit gene was recently discovered. The V-LH molecules have higher bioactivity in vitro, but shorter half-life in circulation, which apparently is related to the alterations of LH function observed in individuals homo- and heterozygous for the V-LHbeta allele. We have now studied whether additional mutations in the V-LHbeta promoter sequence could contribute to the altered physiology of the LH variant molecules. The 661 bp 5'-flanking region of the V-LHbeta gene, retrieved from human genomic DNA by PCR, contained eight single-nucleotide changes, as compared with the wild-type (wt) LHbeta promoter. The finding was consistent in DNA samples of different ethnic groups. Reporter constructs with various lengths of the wt- and V-LH promoter sequences, driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line, LbetaT(2), known to express the endogenous LHbeta gene, and into a non-endocrine human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293. Basal expression levels of the V-LHbeta promoter constructs were on average 36% higher in LbetaT(2)cells ( P < 0.001; n = 29), and 40% higher in HEK 293 cells ( P < 0.001; n = 16), as compared with the respective wt sequences. Numerous qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the two cell lines in responses of the two promoter sequences to stimulation with 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, progesterone and gonado- tropin-releasing hormone. In conclusion, the V-LHbeta promoter has higher basal activity, and differs in response to hormonal stimulation, as compared with the wt-LHbeta promoter. The altered promoter function of the V-LHbeta gene provides evidence for differences in regulation of the wt- and V-LHbeta genes, which may contribute to the differences observed in pituitary-gonadal function between carriers of the two LHbeta alleles. The findings also suggest a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby polymorphic changes resulting in altered bioactivity of a gene product may be compensated for by additional mutations in the cognate promoter sequence, changing transcription of the same gene.

None	GRHPR	The gene encoding hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is mutated in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type II. Primary hyperoxaluria type II (PH2) is a rare monogenic disorder that is characterized by a lack of the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and the oxidation of D-glycerate to hydroxypyruvate. The disease is characterized by an elevated urinary excretion of oxalate and L-glycerate. The increased oxalate excretion can cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalci-nosis and can, in some cases, result in renal failure and systemic oxalate deposition. We identified a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) cDNA clone from a human liver expressed sequence tag (EST) library. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a 1198 nucleotide clone that encoded a 984 nucleotide open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a predicted 328 amino acid protein with a mass of 35 563 Da. Transient transfection of the cDNA clone into COS cells verified that it encoded an enzyme with hydroxy-pyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase and D-glycerate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. Database analysis of human ESTs reveals widespread tissue expression, indicating that the enzyme may have a previously unrecognized role in metabolism. The genomic structure of the human GRHPR gene was determined and contains nine exons and eight introns and spans approximately 9 kb pericentromeric on chromosome 9. Four PH2 patients representing two pairs of siblings from two unrelated families were analyzed for mutations in GRHPR by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. All four patients were homozygous for a single nucleotide deletion at codon 35 in exon 2, resulting in a premature stop codon at codon 45. The cDNA that we have identified represents the first characterization of an animal GRHPR sequence. The data we present will facilitate future genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis of PH2. These data will also facilitate heterozygote testing and prenatal testing in families affected with PH2 to aid in genetic counseling.

anhidrotic ectodermal dyspl	EDA	Ectodysplasin is a collagenous trimeric type II membrane protein with a tumor necrosis factor-like domain and co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures at lateral and apical surfaces of cells. Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is a human genetic disorder of impaired ectodermal appendage development. The EDA gene encodes isoforms of a novel transmembrane protein, ectodysplasin. The sequence of the longest isoform includes an interrupted collagenous domain of 19 Gly-X-Y repeats and a motif conserved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related ligand family. In order to understand better the function of the ectodysplasin protein molecule and its domains, we have studied the processing and localization of wild-type and mutated isoforms in transfected human fetal kidney 293 and monkey kidney COS-1 cells. Similar to other members of collagenous membrane proteins and members of TNF-related ligands, ectodysplasin is a type II membrane protein and it forms trimers. The membrane localization of ectodysplasin is asymmetrical: it is found on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells where it co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures. The TNF-like motif and cysteines found near the C-terminus are necessary for correct transport to the cell membrane, but the intracellular and collagenous domains are not required for the localization pattern. Our results suggest that ectodysplasin is a new member in the TNF-related ligand family involved in the early epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that regulates ectodermal appendage formation.

breast cancer antiestrogen resistance	BCAR1	BCAR1, a human homologue of the adapter protein p130Cas, and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells. BACKGROUND: Treatment of breast cancer with the antiestrogen tamoxifen is effective in approximately one half of the patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease, but tumors recur frequently because of the development of metastases that are resistant to tamoxifen. We have previously shown that mutagenesis of human estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells by insertion of a defective retrovirus genome caused the cells to become antiestrogen resistant. In this study, we isolated and characterized the crucial gene at the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) locus. METHODS/RESULTS: Transfer of the BCAR1 locus from retrovirus-mutated, antiestrogen-resistant cells to estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 cells by cell fusion conferred an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype on the recipient cells. The complete coding sequence of BCAR1 was isolated by use of exon-trapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) library screening. Sequence analysis of human BCAR1 cDNA predicted a protein of 870 amino acids that was strongly homologous to rat p130Cas-adapter protein. Genomic analysis revealed that BCAR1 consists of seven exons and is located at chromosome 16q23.1. BCAR1 transcripts were detected in multiple human tissues and were similar in size to transcripts produced by retrovirus-mutated ZR-75-1 cells. Transfection of BCAR1 cDNA into ZR-75-1 cells again resulted in sustained cell proliferation in the presence of antiestrogens, confirming that BCAR1 was the responsible gene in the locus. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of the BCAR1 gene confers antiestrogen resistance on human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of BCAR1 in retrovirus-mutated cells appears to result from activation of the gene's promoter. The isolation and characterization of this gene open new avenues to elucidating mechanisms by which the growth of human breast cancer becomes independent of estrogen.

langerhans	LC	Langerin, a novel C-type lectin specific to Langerhans cells, is an endocytic receptor that induces the formation of Birbeck granules. We have identified a type II Ca2+-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. Here, we have shown that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to Langerin is internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG. Langerin is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation. Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.

None	hFSH-R	Human follicle stimulating hormone receptor variants lacking transmembrane domains display altered post-translational conformations. Variant splicing of gonadotropin receptor mRNA commonly occurs, however expression of receptor protein variants and their trafficking has yet to be studied in detail. To determine receptor variant trafficking and intracellular processing in mammalian cells, the intracellular fate of intentionally truncated variants of human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (hFSH-R) expressed in CHO cells was examined. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made against the hFSH-R's extracellular domain (ECD) expressed in insect cells. Four mAbs 106.156, 106.290, 106.318, and 106.263 were chosen as probes. Epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, and truncated hFSH-R variants revealed that mAb 106.156 bound to ECD residues 183-220, while mAbs 106.318, 106.290, 106.263 bound ECD residues 300-331. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that mAbs 106.318 and 106.156 stained the surface of fixed, intact CHO cells expressing wild type hFSH-R. However, following cell permeabilization all four antibodies stained hFSH-R in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Permeabilized cells expressing truncated variants ECD213 and ECD254 showed staining accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope continuum. ECD335/His was found to accumulate in extended endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER location of ECD335/His was confirmed by double labeling experiments with concanavalin A and ECD mAb. Glycosidase digestion followed by Western blot analysis show ECD213 and ECD335/His to be glycosylated, but not ECD254. Both glycosylated truncated hFSH-R variants were sensitive to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H but insensitive to neuraminidase indicating that these variants possess high mannose type oligosaccharides. Thus truncated hFSH-R variants do not reach the medial or trans Golgi where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and sialic acid is added. These data suggest that the conformation the ECD of the wild type receptor is different from the ECD alone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This information suggests that the ECD serves two distinct roles; the first is to bind FSH and the other is likely to contact the endodomain of the receptor, which presumably leads to activation of the endodomain for signal transduction.

Both glycosylated truncated hFSH-R variants were sensitive to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H but insensitive to neuraminidase indicating that these variants possess high mannose type oligosaccharides. Thus truncated hFSH-R variants do not reach the medial or trans Golgi where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and sialic acid is added. These data suggest that the conformation the ECD of the wild type receptor is different from the ECD alone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This information suggests that the ECD serves two distinct roles; the first is to bind FSH and the other is likely to contact the endodomain of the receptor, which presumably leads to activation of the endodomain for signal transduction.
None	EDS	The pro-alpha3(V) collagen chain. Complete primary structure, expression domains in adult and developing tissues, and comparison to the structures and expression domains of the other types V and XI procollagen chains. The low abundance fibrillar collagen type V is widely distributed in tissues as an alpha1(V)(2)alpha2(V) heterotrimer that helps regulate the diameters of fibrils of the abundant collagen type I. Mutations in the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) chain genes have been identified in some cases of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), in which aberrant collagen fibrils are associated with connective tissue fragility, particularly in skin and joints. Type V collagen also exists as an alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimer that has remained poorly characterized chiefly due to inability to obtain the complete primary structure or nucleic acid probes for the alpha3(V) chain or its biosynthetic precursor, pro-alpha3(V). Here we provide human and mouse full-length pro-alpha3(V) sequences. Pro-alpha3(V) is shown to be closely related to the alpha1(V) precursor, pro-alpha1(V), but with marked differences in N-propeptide sequences, and collagenous domain features that provide insights into the low melting temperature of alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers, lack of heparin binding by alpha3(V) chains and the possibility that alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers are incorporated into heterotypic fibrils. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detects alpha3(V) expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in joints. This distribution, and the association of alpha1(V), alpha2(V), and alpha3(V) chains in heterotrimers, suggests the human alpha3(V) gene COL5A3 as a candidate locus for at least some cases of classical EDS in which the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) genes have been excluded, and for at least some cases of the hypermobility type of EDS, a condition marked by gross joint laxity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. COL5A3 is mapped to 19p13.2 near a polymorphic marker that should be useful in analyzing linkage with EDS and other disease phenotypes.
follicular dendritic	FDCs	Identification of a human follicular dendritic cell molecule that stimulates germinal center B cell growth. The initial interaction between B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) appears to be essential for germinal center (GC) formation. To identify molecules regulating this interaction, we generated FDC-staining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and screened them for their ability to block FDC-mediated costimulation of growth and differentiation of CD40-stimulated B cells. Using one of the inhibitory mAbs, 8D6, we expression cloned the cDNA encoding the 8D6 antigen (Ag) from a human FDC line, HK. The 8D6 Ag is a novel protein of 282 amino acids that is expressed abundantly on FDCs. Monolayers of COS cells transiently transfected with the 8D6 Ag cDNA stimulate B cell growth. The mAb 8D6 blocks the costimulatory function completely. The inhibitory activity of the mAb 8D6 was demonstrated to be due to an inhibition of cell cycle progression of CD40 ligand-stimulated GC B cells. In addition, the mAb 8D6 inhibits the growth of a lymphoma of GC origin, L3055, which depends on FDCs or HK cells for its growth. These findings suggest that the primary function of FDCs in the GC is to stimulate B cell growth. An FDC signal molecule, 8D6 Ag, may be an important molecule to mediate this function.

uridine 5 ' - diphosphoglucos	UDP-glucose	A G protein-coupled receptor for UDP-glucose. Uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) has a well established biochemical role as a glycosyl donor in the enzymatic biosynthesis of carbohydrates. It is less well known that UDP-glucose may possess pharmacological activity, suggesting that a receptor for this molecule may exist. Here, we show that UDP-glucose, and some closely related molecules, potently activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor KIAA0001 heterologously expressed in yeast or mammalian cells. Nucleotides known to activate P2Y receptors were inactive, indicating the distinctly novel pharmacology of this receptor. The receptor is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including many regions of the brain. These data suggest that some sugar-nucleotides may serve important physiological roles as extracellular signaling molecules in addition to their familiar role in intermediary metabolism.
asparagine - pro	alpha1A(+NP)	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 mutation alters P-type calcium channel function. Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the alpha1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (alpha1A(-NP)). Human alpha1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. alpha1A(-NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the alpha1A channel with NP (alpha1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of alpha1A(-NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly alpha1A(-NP), due to the reduced Ca(2+) influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both alpha1A(-NP) and alpha1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1A(+NP) compensates Ca(2+) influx.
sine ocu	so	Structure, mapping and expression of the human gene encoding the homeodomain protein, SIX2. Vertebrate genes with sequence similarity to the Drosophila homeobox gene, sine oculis (so), constitute the SIX family. There is notable expression of members of this family in anterior neural structures, and several SIX genes have been shown to play roles in vertebrate and insect development, or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of tissues. Mutations in three of these genes in man (SIX5, SIX6 and SIX3) are associated with severe phenotypes, and therefore, the cloning of other human genes from this family is of interest. We have cloned and characterised the gene that encodes human SIX2, elucidated its gene structure and conducted expression studies in a range of tissues. SIX2 is widely expressed in the late first-trimester fetus, but has a limited range of expression sites in the adult. The expression pattern of SIX2 and its localisation to chromosome 2p15-p16 will be of use in assessing its candidacy in human developmental disorders.
pth - related	PTHrP	Enhanced growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing parathyroid hormone-related peptide. PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is a secreted protein produced by breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Because of its structural similarity to PTH at the amino terminus, the two proteins interact with a common cell surface receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor. When overproduced by tumor cells, PTHrP enters the circulation, giving rise to the common paraneoplastic syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Although initially discovered in malignancies, PTHrP is now known to be produced by most cells and tissues in the body. It acts as an autocrine and paracrine mediator of cell proliferation and differentiation, effects which are mediated via the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Recent evidence also has shown that, directly after translation, PTHrP is able to enter the nucleus and/or nucleolus and influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In this study, we have either overproduced PTHrP or inhibited endogenous PTHrP production in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Overexpression of PTHrP was associated with an increase in mitogenesis, whereas inhibiting endogenous PTHrP production resulted in decreased cell proliferation. The overexpressed peptide targeted to the perinuclear space. In contrast, PTHrP interaction with the cell surface PTH/PTHrP receptor resulted in decreased cell proliferation in the same cell line. This latter effect is dependent on interaction with the receptor, in that exogenously added PTHrP moieties known not to interact with the receptor had no effect on cell growth. Furthermore, neutralization of added peptide with an anti-PTHrP antiserum completely abolished the growth inhibitory effects. In contrast, this antibody has no effect on the increased proliferation rate of the MCF-7 transfectants that overexpress PTHrP, compared with control cells. The net effect of autocrine/paracrine and intracrine effects of PTHrP in MCF-7 cells overproducing the peptide is accelerated cell growth. These findings have critical implications regarding the role of PTHrP in breast cancer, and they suggest that controlling PTHrP production in breast cancer may be useful therapeutically.
human granulocytic ehrlichi	HGE	Intracellular parasitism by the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis bacterium through the P-selectin ligand, PSGL-1. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a febrile tick-borne illness caused by a recently discovered intracellular bacterium remarkable for its tropism for professionally phagocytic neutrophils. Monoclonal antibodies against the P-selectin binding domain of the leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, PSGL-1, prevented HGE cell binding and infection, as did enzymatic digestion of PSGL-1. Furthermore, simultaneous neoexpression in nonsusceptible cells of complementary DNAs for both PSGL-1 and its modifying alpha-(1,3) fucosyltransferase, Fuc-TVII, allowed binding and infection by HGE. Thus, the HGE bacterium specifically bound to fucosylated leukocyte PSGL-1. Selectin mimicry is likely central to the organism's unique ability to target and infect neutrophils.
rad23	hHR23	3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) interacts with human RAD23 proteins. Human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) initiates base excision repair by severing the glycosylic bond of numerous damaged bases. In comparison, homologues of the Rad23 proteins (hHR23) and the hXPC protein are involved in the recognition of damaged bases in global genome repair, a subset of nucleotide excision repair. In this report, we show that the hHR23A and -B also interact with the MPG protein and can serve as accessory proteins for DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. Furthermore, the MPG.hHR23 protein complex elevates the rate of MPG protein-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates. This increased excision rate is correlated with a greater binding affinity of the MPG protein-hHR23 protein complex for damaged DNA. These data suggest that the hHR23 proteins function as universal DNA damage recognition accessory proteins in both of these major excision repair pathways.
neutrophil - activating peptide	NAP-2	Identification of distinct surface-expressed and intracellular CXC-chemokine receptor 2 glycoforms in neutrophils: N-glycosylation is essential for maintenance of receptor surface expression. The G protein-coupled CXC-chemokine receptor CXCR-2 mediates activation of neutrophil effector functions in response to multiple ligands, including IL-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). Although CXCR-2 has been successfully cloned and expressed in several cell lines, the molecular properties of the native neutrophil-expressed receptor have remained largely undefined. Here we report on the identification and characterization of distinct CXCR-2 glycoforms and their subcellular distribution in neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of surface-expressed receptors covalently linked to IL-8 or NAP-2 as well as in their unloaded state revealed the occurrence of a single CXCR-2 variant with an apparent size of 56 kDa. According to deglycosylation experiments surface-expressed CXCR-2 carries two N-linked 9-kDa carbohydrate moieties that are both of complex structure. In addition, two other CXCR-2 variants of 38 and 40 kDa were found to occur exclusively intracellular and to carry N-glycosylations of high mannose or hybrid type. These receptors did not participate in ligand-induced receptor trafficking, while surface-expressed CXCR-2 was internalized and re-expressed following stimulation with NAP-2. By enzymatic removal of one 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety in surface-expressed CXCR-2 we can show that neither NAP-2-induced trafficking nor signaling of the receptor is dependent on its full glycosylation. Instead, glycosylation was found to protect CXCR-2 from proteolytic attack, as even partial deglycosylation is associated with serine protease-mediated disappearance of the receptor from the neutrophil surface. Thus, although not directly involved in signaling, glycosylation appears to be required to maintain neutrophil responsiveness to CXC-chemokines during inflammation.
adhesion focal tyrosine	RAFTK	SHP2 mediates the protective effect of interleukin-6 against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Our previous studies have shown that activation of a related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (also known as Pyk2) is required for dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells and that human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known growth and survival factor for MM cells, blocks both RAFTK activation and apoptosis induced by Dex. However, the mechanism whereby IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis is undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediates this protective effect. We show that IL-6 triggers selective activation of SHP2 and its association with RAFTK in Dex-treated MM cells. SHP2 interacts with RAFTK through a region other than its Src homology 2 domains. We demonstrate that RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHP2 both in vitro and in vivo, and that Tyr(906) in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK mediates its interaction with SHP2. Moreover, overexpression of dominant negative SHP2 blocked the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that SHP2 mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 and suggest SHP2 as a novel therapeutic target in MM.

None	MAPK	Alpha(2) adrenoceptors regulate proliferation of human intestinal epithelial cells. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies on rodents have suggested that catecholamines stimulate proliferation of the intestinal epithelium through activation of alpha(2) adrenoceptors located on crypt cells. The occurrence of this effect awaits demonstration in humans and the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of alpha(2) agonists on a clone of Caco2 cells expressing the human alpha(2A) adrenoceptor. METHODS: Cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid containing the alpha2C10 and neomycin phosphotransferase genes. G418 resistant clones were assayed for receptor expression using radioligand binding. Receptor functionality was assessed by testing its ability to couple Gi proteins and to inhibit cAMP production. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was followed by western blot, and cell proliferation was estimated by measuring protein and DNA content. RESULTS: Permanent transfection of Caco2 cells allowed us to obtain a clone (Caco2-3B) expressing alpha(2A) adrenoceptors at a density similar to that found in normal human intestinal epithelium. Caco2-3B retained morphological features and brush border enzyme expression characteristic of enterocytic differentiation. The receptor was coupled to Gi2/Gi3 proteins and its stimulation caused marked diminution of forskolin induced cAMP production. Treatment of Caco2-3B with UK14304 (alpha(2) agonist) induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of MAPK, extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 (Erk1), and 2 (Erk2). This event was totally abolished in pertussis toxin treated cells and in the presence of kinase inhibitors (genistein or PD98059). It was unaffected by protein kinase C downregulation but correlated with a transient increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, sustained exposure of Caco2-3B to UK14304 resulted in modest but significant acceleration of cell proliferation. None of these effects was observed in the parental cell line Caco2. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present study support a regulatory role for alpha(2) adrenoceptors in intestinal cell proliferation.
None	IP-10	IL-4 enhances keratinocyte expression of CXCR3 agonistic chemokines. IFN-induced protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig), and IFN-inducible T-cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC) belong to the non-glutamate-leucine-arginine motif CXC chemokine family and act solely through the CXCR3 receptor for potent attraction of T lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of the T cell-derived cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 to modulate IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC in cultured human keratinocytes and CXCR3 expression in T cells from allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). IL-4, but not IL-10 or IL-17, significantly up-regulated IFN-gamma- or TNF-alpha-induced IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC mRNA accumulation in keratinocytes and increased the levels of IP-10 and Mig in keratinocyte supernatants. Immunohistochemistry of skin affected by ACD revealed that >70% of infiltrating cells were reactive for CXCR3 and that CXCR3 staining colocalized in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Nickel-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines established from ACD skin produced IFN-gamma and IL-4 and expressed moderate to high levels of CXCR3. Finally, CXCR3 agonistic chemokines released by stimulated keratinocytes triggered calcium mobilization in skin-derived nickel-specific CD4+ T cells and promoted their migration, with supernatant from keratinocyte cultures stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-4 attracting more efficaciously than supernatant from keratinocytes activated with IFN-gamma alone. In conclusion, IL-4 exerts a proinflammatory function on keratinocytes by potentiating IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induction of IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC, which in turn may determine a prominent recruitment of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes at inflammatory reaction sites.

gtpase - activating	GAP	The human GRAF gene is fused to MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) and both alleles are disrupted in three cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with a deletion 5q. We have isolated the human GRAF gene (for GTPase regulator associated with the focal adhesion kinase pp125(FAK)). This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway. The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and tumor suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for hematologic malignancies with deletions of 5q. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted. We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient. In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon. GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region. Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q).
liver - expressed chemokin	LEC	LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.
machado - joseph	MJD	Ataxin-3, the MJD1 gene product, interacts with the two human homologs of yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells. However, the normal function of ataxin-3 remains unknown. To explore the function of ataxin-3, we used the two-hybrid system to screen for the protein(s) that interacts with ataxin-3. We found that ataxin-3 interacts with two human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B. Furthermore, we confirmed that ataxin-3 interacts with the -ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is important for nucleotide excision repair; however, ataxin-3 does not interact with -ubiquitin, implying that ataxin-3 might be functionally associated with the HHR23 proteins through this specific interaction. The normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins show no difference in their ability to bind to the HHR23 proteins. However, in 293 cells HHR23A is recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with ataxin-3. These results suggest that this interaction is associated with the normal function of ataxin-3 and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23 proteins might exist in MJD.
cyclin - dependent protein kinase	Cdk5	Identification of a common protein association region in the neuronal Cdk5 activator. Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) depends on the association with neuronal Cdk5 activator (Nck5a) for kinase activity. A variety of cellular proteins have been shown to undergo high affinity association with Nck5a, including three novel proteins, C42, C48, and C53 found by a yeast two-hybrid screen (Ching, Y. P., Qi, Z., and Wang, J. H. (2000) Gene 242, 285-294). The three proteins show competitive binding to Nck5a suggesting that they bind at a common site. The binding site has been mapped to a region of 26 amino acid residues (residues 145 to 170) at the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain of Nck5a. This region of Nck5a contains an amphipathic alpha-helix whose hydrophobic face is involved in Cdk5 activation (Chin, K. T., Ohki, S, Tang, D., Cheng, H. C., Wang, J. H. , and Zhang, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7120-7127). Several lines of evidence suggest that Nck5a interacts with the binding proteins at the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic alpha-helix. First, the Nck5a-(145-170) peptide can bind Cdk5 and Nck5a-binding proteins simultaneously. Second, the association of Nck5a-(145-170) to C48 can be markedly reduced by high ionic strength whereas the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5 is not affected. Third, substitution of Glu(157) by glutamine in Nck5a-(145-170) abolishes the peptide's ability to bind to the three Nck5a-binding proteins without diminishing its Cdk5 binding activity.

None	CXCR3	CXC chemokine receptor 3 expression on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors from human cord blood induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor: chemotaxis and adhesion induced by its ligands, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon gamma. CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is known to be expressed predominately on memory and activated T lymphocytes, is a receptor for both interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10 (gamma IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig). We report the novel finding that CXCR3 is also expressed on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors from human cord blood stimulated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not on freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors. Freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors expressed low levels of CXCR3 messenger RNA, but this expression was highly up-regulated by GM-CSF, as indicated by a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique. gamma IP-10 and Mig induced chemotaxis of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors by means of CXCR3, since an anti-CXCR3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was found to block gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced CD34(+) progenitor chemotaxis. These chemotactic attracted CD34(+) progenitors are colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage. gamma IP-10 and Mig also induced GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitor adhesion and aggregation by means of CXCR3, a finding confirmed by the observation that anti-CXCR3 mAb blocked these functions of gammaIP-10 and Mig but not of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha. gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced up-regulation of integrins (CD49a and CD49b) was found to play a crucial role in adhesion of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. Moreover, gamma IP-10 and Mig stimulated CXCR3 redistribution and cellular polarization in GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. These results indicate that CXCR3-gamma IP-10 and CXCR3-Mig receptor-ligand pairs, as well as the effects of GM-CSF on them, may be especially important in the cytokine/chemokine environment for the physiologic and pathophysiologic events of differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors into lymphoid and myeloid stem cells, subsequently immune and inflammatory cells. These processes include transmigration, relocation, differentiation, and maturation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. (Blood. 2000;96:1230-1238)

knobloch	KS	Collagen XVIII, containing an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, plays a critical role in the maintenance of retinal structure and in neural tube closure (Knobloch syndrome). Knobloch syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by the occurrence of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration with retinal detachment, macular abnormalities and occipital encephalocele. The KS causative gene had been assigned to a 4.3 cM interval at 21q22.3 by linkage analysis of a large consanguineous Brazilian family. We reconstructed the haplotypes of this family with ten additional markers (five were novel) and narrowed the candidate interval to a region of < 245 kb, which contains 24 expressed sequence tags, the KIAA0958 gene and the 5' end of the COL18A1 gene. We identified a homozygous mutation at the AG consensus acceptor splice site of COL18A1 intron 1 exclusively among the 12 KS patients, which was not found among 140 control chromosomes. This mutation predicts the creation of a stop codon in exon 4 and therefore the truncation of the alpha1(XVIII) collagen short form, which was expressed in human adult retina. These findings provide evidence that KS is caused by mutations in COL18A1 which, therefore, has a major role in determining the retinal structure as well as in the closure of the neural tube. Therefore, we show for the first time that the absence of a collagen isoform impairs embryonic cell proliferation and/or migration as a primary or secondary effect.
ikappab kinase	IKK	CIKS, a connection to Ikappa B kinase and stress-activated protein kinase. Pathogens, inflammatory signals, and stress cause acute transcriptional responses in cells. The induced expression of genes in response to these signals invariably involves transcription factors of the NF-kappaB and AP-1/ATF families. Activation of NF-kappaB factors is thought to be mediated primarily via IkappaB kinases (IKK), whereas that of AP-1/ATF can be mediated by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; also named Jun kinases or JNKs). IKKalpha and IKKbeta are two catalytic subunits of a core IKK complex that also contains the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator)/IKKgamma. The latter protein is essential for activation of the IKKs, but its mechanism of action is not known. Here we describe the molecular cloning of CIKS (connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK), a previously unknown protein that directly interacts with NEMO/IKKgamma in cells. When ectopically expressed, CIKS stimulates IKK and SAPK/JNK kinases and it transactivates an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter. Activation of NF-kappaB is prevented in the presence of kinase-deficient, interfering mutants of the IKKs. CIKS may help to connect upstream signaling events to IKK and SAPK/JNK modules. CIKS could coordinate the activation of two stress-induced signaling pathways, functions reminiscent of those noted for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor adaptor proteins.

transforming growth factor -	TGF-beta	Functional consequences of tumorigenic missense mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4. Smads, the intracellular effectors of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, are somatically mutated at high frequency in particular types of human cancers. Certain of these mutations affect the Smad amino-terminal domain, which, in the case of Smad3 and Smad4, binds DNA. We investigated the functional consequences of four missense mutations in the Smad4 amino-terminal domain found in human tumors. The mutant proteins were found to have impaired abilities to bind DNA although they were fully capable of forming complexes with Smad3. All four Smad4 mutants showed decreased protein stability compared to wild-type Smad4. Two of the Smad4 mutants (G65V and P130S) were translocated to the nucleus and were capable of transactivating a Smad-dependent promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, the L43S and R100T mutants were not translocated efficiently to the nucleus and consequently resulted in severely defective transcriptional responses to TGF-beta. Moreover, we demonstrate here the critical importance of two basic residues in the beta-hairpin loop of Smad3 or Smad4 for DNA binding, consistent with predictions from the Smad3 crystal structure. In addition, our results reveal that in the TGF-beta-induced heteromeric signaling complex, loss of DNA binding of Smad4 can be compensated by Smad3, however, both Smad3 and Smad4 are needed for efficient DNA binding and signaling. In conclusion, mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4, that are found in cancer, show loss of multiple functional properties which may contribute to tumorigenesis.
brca2 - associated factor	BRAF35	A human BRCA2 complex containing a structural DNA binding component influences cell cycle progression. Germline mutations of the human BRCA2 gene confer susceptibility to breast cancer. Although the function of the BRCA2 protein remains to be determined, murine cells homozygous for BRCA2 inactivation display chromosomal aberrations. We have isolated a 2 MDa BRCA2-containing complex and identified a structural DNA binding component, designated as BRCA2-Associated Factor 35 (BRAF35). BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly, nuclear staining revealed a close association of BRAF35/BRCA2 complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 phosphorylation. Importantly, antibody microinjection experiments suggest a role for BRCA2/BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression.
chromosome ( chr )	Chr	Cloning, expression and chromosomal location of NKX6B TO 10Q26, a region frequently deleted in brain tumors. Nkx6-2 (former Gtx) is a murine-homeobox-containing gene localized distally on Chromosome (Chr) 7. Analysis of the expression pattern, together with DNA binding assays, suggests that this gene product might be important for differentiated oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene expression. We now report on the cloning and characterization of the human homolog (NKX6B). DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment revealed that the complete human gene spans 1.2 kb and is composed of three exons. NKX6B is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 277 amino acids with 97% identity to mouse Nkx6-2. Northern blot experiments showed that NKX6B expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion with the highest site of expression being the brain. Finally, using STS content mapping and RH analyis, we demonstrated that NKX6B maps to the 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors. These results may implicate NKX6B as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for brain tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

To date, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour growth has been attributed to the induction of angiogenesis. VEGF has been shown to be a survival factor for endothelial cells, preventing apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 expression. In both murine (4T1) and human (MDA-MB-231) metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines, we found that VEGF upregulated Bcl-2 expression and anti-VEGF antibodies reduced Bcl-2 expression. These alterations in Bcl-2 expression were reflected by the levels of tumour cell apoptosis. VEGF resulted in reduced tumour cell apoptosis, whereas its inhibition with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induced apoptosis directly in tumour cells. Therefore, in addition to its role in angiogenesis and vessel permeability, VEGF acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, inducing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis.

endothelial	EC	Endothelial cell costimulation of T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions involves lipid raft aggregation. Human endothelial cells (EC) costimulate CD4(+) memory T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions. In this study we tested the hypothesis that EC activate distinct costimulatory pathways in T cells that target specific transcription factors. AP-1, composed of fos and jun proteins, is a critical effector of TCR signaling and binds several sites in the IL-2 promoter. EC augment c-fos promoter activity in T cells; however, deletion analysis reveals no transcription factor binding sites in the promoter uniquely responsive to EC costimulation. Overexpression of AP-1 proteins in T cells augments the activity of an AP-1-luciferase reporter gene equally in the absence or the presence of EC costimulation. Interestingly, EC stimulate a similar 2- to 3-fold up-regulation of AP-1, NF-AT, NF-kappaB, and NF-IL-2-luciferase reporters. CD2 mAbs completely block EC effects on all of these pathways, as well as costimulation of IL-2 secretion. We conclude that EC costimulation through CD2 does not trigger a single distinct costimulatory pathway in T cells, but rather, it amplifies several pathways downstream of the TCR. Indeed, we find that early EC costimulation acts " upstream " of the TCR by promoting lipid raft aggregation, thus amplifying TCR signaling. Soluble CD2 mAbs block EC-induced raft aggregation, whereas cross-linking CD2 promotes aggregation. These data are consistent with the critical role of CD2 in organizing the T cell-APC contact zone.
mammalian target of rapamy	mTOR	AMP-activated protein kinase suppresses protein synthesis in rat skeletal muscle through down-regulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is viewed as an energy sensor that acts to modulate glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Given that protein synthesis is a high energy-consuming process, it may be transiently depressed during cellular energy stress. Thus, the intent of this investigation was to examine whether AMPK activation modulates the translational control of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Injections of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR) were used to activate AMPK in male rats. The activity of alpha1 AMPK remained unchanged in gastrocnemius muscle from AICAR-treated animals compared with controls, whereas alpha2 AMPK activity was significantly increased (51%). AICAR treatment resulted in a reduction in protein synthesis to 45% of the control value. This depression was associated with decreased activation of protein kinases in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B on Ser(473), mTOR on Ser(2448), ribosomal protein S6 kinase on Thr(389), and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein on Thr(37). A reduction in eIF4E associated with eIF4G to 10% of the control value was also noted. In contrast, eIF2B activity remained unchanged in response to AICAR treatment and therefore would not appear to contribute to the depression in protein synthesis. This is the first investigation to demonstrate changes in translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to AMPK activation.

methyl - beta - cyclodext	MCD	ADAM10-mediated cleavage of L1 adhesion molecule at the cell surface and in released membrane vesicles. Cells can release membrane components in a soluble form and as membrane vesicles. L1, an important molecule for cell migration of neural and tumor cells, is released by membrane-proximal cleavage, and soluble L1 promotes cell migration. Release of L1 is enhanced by shedding inducers such as phorbol ester and pervanadate, but it is also enhanced by depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). How such different compounds can induce shedding is presently unknown. We show here that ADAM10 is involved in L1 cleavage, which occurs at the cell surface and in the Golgi apparatus. MCD and pervanadate treatment induced the release of microvesicles containing full-length L1 and the active form of ADAM10. L1 cleavage occurred in isolated vesicles. L1-containing microvesicles could trigger haptotactic cell migration. Only the neural L1 form carrying the RSLE signal for clathrin-dependent endocytosis was recruited and cleaved in vesicles. Phorbol ester treatment activated L1 cleavage predominantly at the cell surface. Our results provide evidence for two pathways of L1 cleavage, based on ADAM10 localization, that can be activated differentially: 1) direct cleavage at the cell surface, and 2) release and cleavage in secretory vesicles most likely derived from the Golgi apparatus. The findings establish a novel role for ADAM10 as a vesicle-based protease.
myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homo	MYC	Yaf2 inhibits Myc biological function. The proto-oncogenes of the myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) family, including MYC, MYCN and MYCL, encode nuclear proteins that act as transcription factors. The Myc protein is the best studied member of this family and is involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and cell death. We have previously demonstrated that the zinc-finger protein Yaf2 interacts with the central region of MycN and enhances MycN dependent transcriptional activation. Here we show that Yaf2 also binds to the Myc protein in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to the activating effect on MycN function, Yaf2 inhibits Myc mediated transactivation and transformation. This differential influence on two members of the Myc family gives insight into a new mechanism to modulate the biological activities of Myc transcription factors.
vh1 -	VHR	Expression cloning of a human dual-specificity phosphatase. Using an expression cloning strategy, we isolated a cDNA encoding a human protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Bacteria expressing the kinase domain of the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (bek/fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) were infected with a fibroblast cDNA library in a phagemid prokaryotic expression vector and screened with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Among several clones showing decreased anti-phosphotyrosine recognition, one displayed phosphatase activity toward the kinase in vitro. The 4.1-kilobase cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 185 amino acids with limited sequence similarity to the vaccinia virus phosphatase VH1. The purified recombinant protein dephosphorylated several activated growth factor receptors, as well as serine-phosphorylated casein, in vitro. Both serine and tyrosine phosphatase activities were completely abolished by mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue conserved in VH1 and the VH1-related (VHR) human protein. These properties suggest that VHR is capable of regulating intracellular events mediated by both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation.
ah receptor nuclear translocator	Arnt	Identification of the Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) as a component of the DNA binding form of the Ah receptor. The Ah (dioxin) receptor binds a number of widely disseminated environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mediates their carcinogenic effects. The ligand-bound receptor activates Cyp 1a1 gene transcription through interaction with specific DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs). The Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) is required for Ah receptor function. Arnt is now shown to be a structural component of the XRE binding form of the Ah receptor. Furthermore, Arnt and the ligand-binding subunit of the receptor were extracted as a complex from the nuclei of cells treated with ligand. Arnt contains a basic helix-loop-helix motif, which may be responsible for interacting with both the XRE and the ligand-binding subunit.

scaffold attachment	SAR	Characterization of SAF-A, a novel nuclear DNA binding protein from HeLa cells with high affinity for nuclear matrix/scaffold attachment DNA elements. We identified four proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells which specifically bind to a scaffold attachment region (SAR) element from the human genome. Of these four proteins, SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), shows the highest affinity for several homologous and heterologous SAR elements from vertebrate cells. SAF-A is an abundant nuclear protein and a constituent of the nuclear matrix and scaffold. The homogeneously purified protein is a novel double stranded DNA binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa. SAF-A binds at multiple sites to the human SAR element; competition studies with synthetic polynucleotides indicate that these sites most probably reside in the multitude of A/T-stretches which are distributed throughout this element. In addition we show by electron microscopy that the protein forms large aggregates and mediates the formation of looped DNA structures.

chinese hamster o	CHO	Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3-GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase by gene transfer into CHO cells expressing polyoma large tumor antigen. A cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.102), which forms critical branches in O-glycans, has been isolated by an expression cloning approach using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Increased activity of this enzyme and the concomitant occurrence of the O-glycan core 2 structure [Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc] has been observed in a variety of biological processes, such as T-cell activation and immunodeficiency due to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS. Since CHO cells do not express this enzyme, CHO cell lines were established to stably express polyoma large tumor (T) antigen, which enables transient expression cloning. Because the antibody used was found to detect most efficiently the oligosaccharide products attached to leukosialin, the CHO cells were also stably transfected with leukosialin cDNA. By using this particular CHO cell line, a cDNA that encodes a protein determining the formation of the core 2 structure was isolated from an HL-60 cDNA library. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein with type II membrane topology, as has been found for all other mammalian glycosyltransferases cloned to date. The expression of the presumed catalytic domain as a fusion protein with the IgG binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate unequivocally that the cDNA encodes the core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc structures. No activity with this enzyme was detected toward the acceptors for other beta 1-6GlcNAc transferases.

human umbilical vein endoth	HUVE	Cloning of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible primary response gene that is differentially expressed in development and capillary tube-like formation in vitro. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on cells and tissues, mediated in large part by alterations in target tissue gene expression. We have used the technique of differential hybridization to identify several primary response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, a cell type that is profoundly activated by cytokine treatment. One of these cDNA, designated B94, detects a rapidly and transiently induced 4-kb transcript in TNF-treated HUVE cells, and this transcript is superinduced in the concomitant presence of cycloheximide. Other proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1 beta and LPS are also able to induce B94 mRNA expression. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that TNF induction of B94 transcript occurs primarily at the level of transcriptional activation. Further, B94 is shown to be a single copy gene that is evolutionarily conserved. The gene is localized to the q32 region of chromosome 14, a region that is often rearranged in lymphoid neoplasms. B94 transcript expression is also found to be regulated during mouse development and in an in vitro model of endothelial capillary tube formation. Developmental regulation occurs most prominently in mouse embryonic liver and kidney, and a second smaller form of B94 transcript is detected in the placenta and testes. B94 and other TNF-responsive transcripts are also induced during capillary tube formation suggesting overlap between genes induced by TNF and those induced during angiogenesis. Sequence analysis of the B94 cDNA reveals an open reading frame encoding a 73-kDa polypeptide that has no homology to any known protein. Polyclonal antisera directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the B94 protein immunoprecipitates a protein of the predicted molecular mass both from COS cells transfected with a B94 expression vector and from TNF-treated HUVE cells.
membrane inhibitor of reactive l	MIRL	Structure of the CD59-encoding gene: further evidence of a relationship to murine lymphocyte antigen Ly-6 protein. The gene for CD59 [membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), protectin], a phosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein that regulates the formation of the polymeric C9 complex of complement and that is deficient on the abnormal hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, consists of four exons spanning 20 kilobases. The untranslated first exon is preceded by a G+C-rich promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA or CAAT motif. The second exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence of the protein, and the third exon encodes the amino-terminal portion of the mature protein. The fourth exon encodes the remainder of the mature protein, including the hydrophobic sequence necessary for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The structure of the CD59 gene is very similar to that encoding Ly-6, a murine glycoprotein with which CD59 has some structural similarity. The striking similarity in gene structure is further evidence that the two proteins belong to a superfamily of proteins that may also include the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor and a squid glycoprotein of unknown function.
interleukin - 1 receptor	IL-1ra	Cloning and chromosome mapping of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene. By screening a human genomic library with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) cDNA probe, we have isolated a 15 kb clone which contains the entire coding region of the gene as expressed in monocytes, and includes 6 kb of 5'-upstream sequence. The gene contains four exons which code for the secreted form of the IL-1ra, however, our clone does not contain the alternative first exon used to generate an intracellular form of the protein as the protein as found in epithelial cells. Analysis of the sequence reveals a consensus TATA box, and three Alu repeats, two of which are in the upstream region and one in intron 3. The sequence also reveals an 86 bp motif tandomly repeated four times within intron 2, and may reflect the polymorphism known to exist in this region of the gene. By in-situ fluorescence hybridization we have shown that the IL-1ra gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 and maps to 2q13-14.1. Previous studies have revealed that IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta and both type I and type II forms of the IL-1 receptor all map close to this region of chromosome 2.
x - ray repair cross - complementing group	XRCC1	Aprataxin, the causative protein for EAOH is a nuclear protein with a potential role as a DNA repair protein. Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and hypoalbuminemia. Recently, the causative gene for EAOH, APTX, has been identified. Of the two splicing variants of APTX mRNA, the short and the long forms, long-form APTX mRNA was found to be the major isoform. Aprataxin is mainly located in the nucleus, and, furthermore, the first nuclear localization signal located near the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is essential for its nuclear localization. We found, based on the yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, that the long-form but not the short-form aprataxin interacts with XRCC1 (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1). Interestingly the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is homologous with polynucleotidekinase-3'-phosphatase, which has been demonstrated to be involved in base excision repair, a subtype of single-strand DNA break repair, through interaction with XRCC1, DNA polymerase beta, and DNA ligase III. These results strongly support the possibility that aprataxin and XRCC1 constitute a multiprotein complex and are involved in single-strand DNA break repair, and furthermore, that accumulation of unrepaired damaged DNA underlies the pathophysiological mechanisms of EAOH.
helix - loop -	HLH	Mutually exclusive expression of a helix-loop-helix gene and N-myc in human neuroblastomas and in normal development. We have isolated a novel human gene encoding a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein by molecularly cloning chromosome 1p36-specific CpG islands. The gene termed heir-1 was localized to the neuroblastoma consensus deletion at 1p36.2-p36.12. Its predicted protein is 95.8% identical to the mouse HLH462 protein and has clear homology to the mouse Id and Drosophila emc proteins. Heir-1 does not encode a basic DNA binding domain as found in basic HLH proteins. The gene is expressed specifically at high abundance in adult lung, kidney and adrenal medulla, but not in adult brain. Despite prominent heir-1 expression in adrenal medulla, which is a prime target for neuroblastomas, 10 out of 12 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines revealed very low levels of heir-1 mRNA. Low heir-1 expression was generally found in tumor cell lines with N-myc overexpression, whereas the two cell lines displaying high heir-1 levels did not overexpress N-myc. Mutually exclusive expression of both genes was also found by in situ hybridization in developing mouse tissues, particularly in the forebrain neuroectoderm. We conclude that heir-1 expression is reduced specifically in the majority of neuroblastomas and suggest an inverse correlation between heir-1 and N-myc expression in neuroblastoma tumors and in embryonic development.
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein	hnRNPs	Primary structure and binding activity of the hnRNP U protein: binding RNA through RGG box. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are thought to influence the structure of hnRNA and participate in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA. The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity.
ciliary neurotrophic	CNTF	The receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor. Although neurotrophic factors were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to support the survival of neurons, these molecules are now thought to influence many aspects of the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A " tagged-ligand panning " procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggestes that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage.
retinoic acid	RAR	A direct repeat in the cellular retinol-binding protein type II gene confers differential regulation by RXR and RAR. The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We provide evidence that expression of the gene for cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII), a key protein in the intestinal absorption of vitamin A, is dramatically up-regulated by retinoic acid in the presence of RXR but not RAR. This regulation is conferred through a specific cis element in the CRBPII promoter that contains five nearly perfect tandem repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by a single nucleotide. The discovery of this new RX response element provides a means for distinguishing between the two retinoid receptor systems and suggests that an RXR-mediated pathway exists for modulating vitamin A metabolism.

This regulation is conferred through a specific cis element in the CRBPII promoter that contains five nearly perfect tandem repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by a single nucleotide. The discovery of this new RX response element provides a means for distinguishing between the two retinoid receptor systems and suggests that an RXR-mediated pathway exists for modulating vitamin A metabolism.

cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation	CLMF	Coexpression of two distinct genes is required to generate secreted bioactive cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor. Cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF) is a disulfide-bonded heterodimeric lymphokine that (i) acts as a growth factor for activated T cells independent of interleukin 2 and (ii) synergizes with suboptimal concentrations of interleukin 2 to induce lymphokine-activated killer cells. We now report the cloning and expression of both human CLMF subunit cDNAs from a lymphoblastoid B-cell line, NC-37. The two subunits represent two distinct and unrelated gene products whose mRNAs are coordinately induced upon activation of NC-37 cells. Coexpression of the two subunit cDNAs in COS cells is necessary for the secretion of biologically active CLMF; COS cells transfected with either subunit cDNA alone do not secrete bioactive CLMF. Recombinant CLMF expressed in mammalian cells displays biologic activities essentially identical to natural CLMF, and its activities can be neutralized by monoclonal antibodies prepared against natural CLMF. Since this heterodimeric protein displays the properties of an interleukin, we propose that CLMF be given the designation interleukin 12.
None	Bcm-1	Structure, expression, and genetic linkage of the mouse BCM1 (OX45 or Blast-1) antigen. Evidence for genetic duplication giving rise to the BCM1 region on mouse chromosome 1 and the CD2/LFA3 region on mouse chromosome 3. The mouse BCM1 (OX45, Blast-1) antigen has been cDNA cloned and sequenced to provide data supporting the view that BCM1, LFA3, and CD2 constitute a subgroup within the Ig superfamily. Mouse BCM1 is widely expressed on leukocytes and is likely to be anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, as is the case for rat and human BCM1 antigen. Genetic linkage studies by recombination and pulse field analysis showed the BCM1 locus (Bcm-1) to be on distal mouse chromosome 1 and to be linked within 1,600 kb to the locus for an ATPase alpha chain gene (Atpa-3). A similar relationship was established between the human BCM1 locus (BCM1) and ATP1A2, and other markers on chromosome 1q. Conservation of genomic organization within a segment of human chromosome 1q and mouse chromosome 1 was demonstrated. A similar situation is seen in the region of the CD2 and LFA3 genes between mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 1p. Furthermore, the CD2/LFA3 genes are linked within 580 kb to Atpa-1/ATP1A1 genes to provide a parallel situation to the linkage between Bcm-1/BCM1 and Atpa-3/ATP1A2 on chromosomes 1 (mouse) and 1q (human). Taken together, the data suggest duplication of a chromosome region including the precursors of the genes for BCM1, CD2, and LFA3, and the ATPase genes to give rise to the linkage groups now observed. The duplicated regions may have stayed together on chromosome 1 in the human (with the insertion of a centromere), while in the mouse, the genetic regions are proposed to have become dispersed in the formation of chromosomes 1 and 3. CD2 and LFA3 are more dissimilar in sequence than BCM1 and LFA3, and if the precursors of the CD2 and LFA3 loci formed before the proposed chromosome segment duplication, then a gene encoding a recognizer molecule for BCM1 may exist in linkage with Bcm-1/BCM1 on chromosome 1 (mouse) and 1q (human).
None	TNF-Rs	Soluble forms of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNF-Rs). The cDNA for the type I TNF-R, cloned using amino acid sequence data of its soluble form, encodes both the cell surface and a soluble form of the receptor. Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have recently been isolated from human urine in our laboratory. The two proteins cross-react immunologically with two species of cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-R). Antibodies against one of the two TNF binding proteins (TBPI) were found to have effects characteristic of TNF, including stimulating phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins. Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TBPI were used to clone the cDNA for the structurally related cell surface type 1 TNF-R. It is notable that although this receptor can signal the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, it appears from its amino acid sequence to be devoid of intrinsic protein kinase activity. The extracellular domain of the receptor is composed of four internal cysteine-rich repeats, homologous to structures repeated four times in the extracellular domains of the nerve growth factor receptor and the B lymphocytes surface antigen CDw40. The amino acid composition and size of the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R closely resemble those of TBPI. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the four cysteine rich repeats within the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R matches the COOH-terminal sequence of TBPI. Amino acid sequences in the extracellular domain also fully match other sequences found in TBPI. On the other hand, amino acid sequences in the soluble form of the type II TNF-R (TBPII), while indicating a marked homology of structure, did not suggest any identity between this protein and the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R. CHO cells transfected with type I TNF-R cDNA produced both cell surface and soluble forms of the receptor. The receptor produced by CHO cells was recognized by several monoclonal antibodies against TBPI, reacting with several distinct epitopes in this molecule. These data suggest that the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs are structurally identical to the extracellular cytokine binding domains of these receptors and are consistent with the notion that the soluble forms are, at least partly, derived from the same transcripts that encode the cell surface receptors.

tumor necrosis	TNF	A novel secretory tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein (TSG-6) is a member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, closely related to the adhesion receptor CD44. TSG-6 cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a lambda cDNA library prepared from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts. We show that TSG-6 mRNA was not detectable in untreated cells, but became readily induced by TNF in normal human fibroblast lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, TSG-6 mRNA was undetectable in either control or TNF-treated human vascular endothelial cells and a variety of tumor-derived or virus-transformed cell lines. The sequence of full-length TSG-6 cDNA revealed one major open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including a typical cleavable signal peptide. The NH2-terminal half of the predicted TSG-6 protein sequence shows a significant homology with a region implicated in hyaluronate binding, present in cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core proteins, and the adhesion receptor CD44. The most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted TSG-6 protein and CD44. Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a TSG-6 fusion protein detected a 39-kD glycoprotein in the supernatants of TNF-treated FS-4 cells and of cells transfected with TSG-6 cDNA. Binding of the TSG-6 protein to hyaluronate was demonstrated by coprecipitation. Our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (TNF or IL-1)-inducible, secretory TSG-6 protein is a novel member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, possibly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.
cholinesterase - related cell division	CHED	Cloning and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibition of a human homolog of cdc2 required in hematopoiesis. Mechanisms triggering the commitment of pluripotent bone marrow stem cells to differentiated lineages such as mononuclear macrophages or multinucleated megakaryocytes are still unknown, although several lines of evidence suggested correlation between cholinergic signaling and hematopoietic differentiation. We now present cloning of a cDNA coding for CHED (cholinesterase-related cell division controller), a human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell division cycle 2 (cdc2)-like kinases, universal controllers of the mitotic cell cycle. Library screening, RNA blot hybridization, and direct PCR amplification of cDNA reverse-transcribed from cellular mRNA revealed that CHED mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone marrow. The CHED protein includes the consensus ATP binding and phosphorylation domains characteristic of kinases, displays 34-42% identically aligned amino acid residues with other cdc2-related kinases, and is considerably longer at its amino and carboxyl termini. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to interrupt CHED's expression (AS-CHED) significantly reduced the ratio between CHED mRNA and actin mRNA within 1 hr of its addition to cultures, a reduction that persisted for 4 days. AS-CHED treatment selectively inhibited megakaryocyte development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other hematopoietic pathways, as evidenced by increasing numbers of mononuclear cells. An oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase, displayed a similar inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis. In contrast, an oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with cellular proliferation without altering the cell-type composition of these cultures. Therefore, these findings strengthen the link between cholinergic signaling and cell division control in hematopoiesis and implicate both CHED and cholinesterases in this differentiation process.

None	DGI	Structural analysis and expression of human desmoglein: a cadherin-like component of the desmosome. Desmosomes are adhesive cell junctions found in great abundance in tissues that experience mechanical stress. The transmembrane desmosomal glycoproteins have been proposed to play a role in cell adhesion; desmoglein I (DGI) is a major member of this class of desmosomal molecules. However, evidence supporting a role for DGI in cell adhesion or in the plaque is lacking. In order to begin to understand DGI function we have identified human cDNA clones encoding the entire mature polypeptide of 1000 amino acids. Our data suggest that like the bovine DGI molecule human DGI is highly related to the calcium-dependent class of cell adhesion molecules known as cadherins. Four related extracellular domains located in the amino-terminal domain of the molecule contain putative calcium binding sites originally identified in the cadherins. The highest degree of similarity between human N-cadherin and human DGI, and likewise between bovine DGI and human DGI, is greatest in the most amino-terminal extracellular domain. This suggests a conserved functional role for the extracellular domains, perhaps in calcium-mediated cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains a cadherin-like region and, like bovine DGI, a carboxy-terminal tail that is not present in the cadherins, comprising three additional domains. One of these contains a novel repeating motif of 29 +/- 1 residues, first identified in bovine DGI. Each of the highly homologous repeating units is likely to consist of two beta-strands and two turns with special characteristics. Five amino acids that are identical in bovine and human DGI lie in the second of the two predicted beta-strands, and intriguingly contain putative target sites for protein kinase C. On the basis of structural analysis, a model predicting the disposition of human DGI domains in the desmosome is proposed. Northern analysis suggests that unlike bovine epidermis, which expresses a single mRNA of reported size approximately 7.6 kb, human foreskin and cultured keratinocytes display a complex pattern with bands of approximately 7.2, 4.0 and 3.0 kb. Each of these cross-hybridizing mRNAs is coordinately expressed in normal human keratinocytes in response to long-term culture and increased calcium.
rat stem cell	SCF	Primary structure and functional expression of rat and human stem cell factor DNAs. Partial cDNA and genomic clones of rat stem cell factor (SCF) have been isolated. Using probes based on the rat sequence, partial and full-length cDNA and genomic clones of human SCF have been isolated. Based on the primary structure of the 164 amino acid protein purified from BRL-3A cells, truncated forms of the rat and human proteins have been expressed in E. coli and mammalian cells and have been shown to possess biological activity. SCF is able to augment the proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow cultures. SCF exhibits potent synergistic activities in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors, resulting in increased colony numbers and colony size.
1269 base	bp	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase. The cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase [EC 4.99.1.1] was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 by screening with a radiolabeled fragment of mouse ferrochelatase cDNA. The cDNA had an open reading frame of 1269 base pairs (bp) encoding a protein of 423 amino acid residues (Mr. 47,833) with alternative putative polyadenylation signals in the 3' non-coding regions and poly (A) tails. Amino acid sequencing showed that the mature protein consists of 369 amino acid residues (Mr. 42,158) with a putative leader sequence of 54 amino acid residues. The human enzyme showed an 88% identity to mouse enzyme and 46% to yeast enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNAs of about 2500 and 1600 bp for ferrochelatase in K562 and HepG2 cells. As full-length cDNA for human ferrochelatase is now available, molecular lesions related to erythropoietic protoporphyria can be characterized.
branched chain alpha - ketoacid dehydro	BCKDH	Maple syrup urine disease. Complete primary structure of the E1 beta subunit of human branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deduced from the nucleotide sequence and a gene analysis of patients with this disease. A defect in the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is one cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized a 1.35 kbp cDNA clone encoding the entire precursor of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH complex from a human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA clone (lambda hBE1 beta-1) contained a 5'-untranslated sequence of four nucleotides, the translated sequence of 1,176 nucleotides and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 169 nucleotides. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of the clone with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature bovine BCKDH-E1 beta subunit showed that the cDNA insert encodes for a 342-amino acid subunit with a Mr = 37,585. The subunit is synthesized as the precursor with a leader sequence of 50 amino acids and is processed at the NH2 terminus. A search for protein homology revealed that the primary structure of human BCKDH-E1 beta was similar to the bovine BCKDH-E1 beta and to the E1 beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in all regions. The structures and functions of mammalian alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are apparently highly conserved. Genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal and five MSUD patients, in whom E1 beta was not detected by immunoblot analysis, gave the same restriction maps on Southern blot analysis. The gene has at least 80 kbp.

human gastric cathepsin	CTSE	Human gastric cathepsin E. Predicted sequence, localization to chromosome 1, and sequence homology with other aspartic proteinases. The predicted sequence of human gastric cathepsin E (CTSE) was determined by analysis of cDNA clones isolated from a library constructed with poly(A+) RNA from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. The CTSE cDNA clones were identified using a set of complementary 18-base oligonucleotide probes specific for a 6-residue sequence surrounding the first active site of all previously characterized human aspartic proteinases. Sequence analysis of CTSE cDNA clones revealed a 1188-base pair open reading frame that exhibited 59% sequence identity with human pepsinogen A. The predicted CTSE amino acid sequence includes a 379-residue proenzyme (Mr = 40,883) and a 17-residue signal peptide. The predicted CTSE amino acid composition was consistent with that of purified material from gastric mucosa and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Additional evidence for the identification of the CTSE cDNA clones was obtained by analysis of poly(A+) RNA isolated from CTSE-producing and -nonproducing gastric adenocarcinoma cell subclones. Three RNA transcripts (3.6, 2.6, and 2.1 kilobases) were identified in poly(A+) RNA isolated from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line that produced CTSE that were absent from nonproducing subclones. CTSE contains 7 cysteine residues, of which 6 were localized by comparative maximal alignment analysis with pepsinogen A to conserved residues that form intrachain disulfide bonds. The seventh cysteine residue of CTSE is located within the activation peptide region of the proenzyme. We suspect that this residue forms an interchain disulfide bond and thereby determines the dimerization of CTSE proenzyme molecules that is observed under native conditions. The CTSE gene was localized to human chromosome 1 by concurrent cytogenetic and cDNA probe analyses of a panel of human x mouse somatic cell hybrids.
retinoblasto	Rb	Homology between a region of the human retinoblastoma gene and L1 family repetitive sequences. Five clones that hybridized weakly with the human retinoblastoma (Rb) gene were obtained by screening a human genomic library in a non-stringent condition. The DNAs of two of these clones were partially sequenced and found to contain a region with considerable homology to part of the Rb gene. These two clones were found to contain L1 family repeating sequences. This finding is discussed in relation with possible functions of the L1 family. As the L1 family is transposable, the Rb gene may be inactivated by recombination at this homologous region. Another possibility related with the DNA binding properties of Rb and L1 family proteins is also discussed.
chicken ovalbumin upstream	COUP	COUP transcription factor is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor (COUP-TF) exists in a number of different tissues and is essential for expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene. It binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with a second protein (S300-II), stimulates initiation of transcription in vitro. COUP-TF also binds specifically to the rat insulin promoter element, although the two binding sites share little sequence similarity. Here we report the isolation of a human complementary DNA clone encoding COUP-TF. Comparison of the amino-acid sequence of COUP-TF with known sequences reveals that it is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor superfamily. Consequently, it is the first member of this family that has been shown to function in a cell-free transcription system. We conclude that this superfamily of gene regulators contains proteins which bind and activate distal promoter elements of eukaryotic genes.
interleukin -	IL-2	Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain gene: generation of three receptor forms by cloned human alpha and beta chain cDNA's. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to two distinct receptor molecules, the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha, p55) chain and the newly identified IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2R beta, p70-75) chain. The cDNA encoding the human IL-2R beta chain has now been isolated. The overall primary structure of the IL-2R beta chain shows no apparent homology to other known receptors. Unlike the IL-2R alpha chain, the IL-2R beta chain has a large cytoplasmic region in which a functional domain (or domains) mediating an intracellular signal transduction pathway (or pathways) may be embodied. The cDNA-encoded beta chain binds and internalizes IL-2 when expressed on T lymphoid cells but not fibroblast cells. Furthermore, the cDNA gives rise to the generation of high-affinity IL-2 receptor when co-expressed with the IL-2R alpha chain cDNA.

low density lipoprot	LDL	Autoimmune target in Heymann nephritis is a glycoprotein with homology to the LDL receptor. The pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous glomerulonephritis, depends on the interaction of autoantibodies with a renal glycoprotein (GP330) on glomerular podocytes. Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor.
avian myeloblastosis	AMV	Studies of the human c-myb gene and its product in human acute leukemias. The myb gene is the transforming oncogene of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV); its normal cellular homolog, c-myb, is conserved across a broad span of evolution. In humans, c-myb is expressed in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic tumors. Partial complementary DNA clones were generated from blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The sequences of the clones were compared to the c-myb of other species, as well as the v-myb of AMV. In addition, the carboxyl terminal region of human c-myb was placed in an expression vector to obtain protein for the generation of antiserum, which was used to identify the human c-myb gene product. Like v-myb, this protein was found within the nucleus of leukemic cells where it was associated with the nuclear matrix. These studies provide further evidence that c-myb might be involved in human leukemia.
serum response	SRE	Isolation and properties of cDNA clones encoding SRF, a transcription factor that binds to the c-fos serum response element. The serum response element (SRE) is a sequence required for transient transcriptional activation of genes in response to growth factors. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous nuclear protein that binds to the SRE. The SRF gene is highly conserved through evolution, and in cultured cells its transcription is itself transiently increased following serum stimulation. A cDNA clone of SRF expressed in vitro generates protein that forms complexes indistinguishable from those formed with HeLa cell SRF, as judged by DNA binding specificity and the ability to promote SRE-dependent in vitro transcription. SRF binds DNA as a dimer, and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein exhibits striking homology to two yeast regulatory proteins.

carcinoembryonic	CEA	The human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins are members of the same multigene family. Pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G), a major product of the placenta with unknown function, consists of a set of glycoproteins synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast. We report here the molecular cloning of 3 cDNA encoding different members of the PS beta G family. Two clones (C, D) correspond to a single transcript undergoing differential splicing. The third one (E) originates from a different gene. All three clones have identical (C, D) or similar (E) coding sequences except for the last residues at their carboxyl end. They contain 93 residue motifs related to the ancestral Ig-like domain which makes them new members of this gene superfamily. A striking sequence similarity (50 to 60%) is observed between PS beta G and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins. The evolutionary relationship between CEA and PS beta G points to a possible common function in the control of cell invasion and/or metastasis.

delta - aminolevulinic acid dehydra	ALA-D	Molecular cloning of a cDNA for human delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. A cDNA encoding human delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D; EC 4.2.1.24), the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from a human liver cDNA expression library. Of the original 17 clones selected with anti-ALA-D antibody, only four expressed anti-ALA-D epitopes as assessed by rescreening with antibody preabsorbed with purified antigen. Subsequent screening of the antibody-positive clones with mixed oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo) probes, synthesized to correspond to human N-terminal and bovine active-site peptide sequences, identified three clones which hybridized only with the oligo probes for the bovine amino acid (aa) sequences. Restriction endonucleases analysis revealed that these three clones contained the same 800-bp cDNA insert. This insert was recloned into bacteriophage M13mp18 and mp19 and sequenced by primer extension. The aa sequence predicted from the partial nucleotide sequence was found to be essentially colinear with the sequences of four bovine ALA-D peptides, totaling 35 non-overlapping aa residues.

	BB	Human muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency: newly discovered metabolic myopathy. Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase activity was decreased (5.7 percent of the lowest control value) in a 52-year-old man with intolerance for strenuous exercise and recurrent pigmenturia since adolescence. All of the other enzymes of glycolysis had normal activities, and glycogen concentration was normal. Electrophoretic, heat lability, and mercury inhibition studies showed that the small residual activity in the patient's muscle was represented by the brain (BB) isoenzyme of phosphoglycerate mutase, suggesting a genetic defect of the M subunit which predominates in normal muscle. The prevalence of the BB isoenzyme in other tissues, including muscle culture, may explain why symptoms were confined to muscle.
landsteiner -	LW	Linkage of the LW blood group locus with the complement C3 and Lutheran blood group loci. Segregation data on LW in families of informative males show that the LW (Landsteiner-Wiener) blood group locus is closely linked to the complement C3 locus and to the locus for the Lutheran blood group. This finding also confirms the presence of a larger linkage group on chromosome 19, including now the loci for apoE, Le, C3, LW, Lu, Se, H, PEPD, myotonic dystrophy (DM), neurofibromatosis (NF) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC). Linkage of LW with the Lewis blood group locus could not be definitely established by the present family data, but small positive scores between LW and Le suggest that the Le locus is situated outside the C3-LW region.

nerve growth	NGF	Human beta-nerve growth factor gene sequence highly homologous to that of mouse. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to have a profound effect on the development and maintenance of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurones (see refs 1-3 for review). NGF activity isolated from the male mouse submaxillary gland (MSG) consists of three types of subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which specifically interact to form a 7S, approximately 130,000-molecular weight (Mr) complex. The 7S complex contains two identical 118-amino acid beta-chains, which are solely responsible for the nerve growth-stimulating activity of NGF. While NGF is found in almost all vertebrates, most research has focused on murine NGF, as the mouse male submaxillary gland contains higher levels of this polypeptide than other tissues. Even so, beta-NGF comprises only approximately 0.1% of the protein in this small gland, which has made the study of this polypeptide difficult. The amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF beta-chain has been determined and some information has been obtained regarding the size of a mouse precursor molecule, pro-beta-NGF, but little was known about the structure and relatedness of beta-NGF from other vertebrates. Here we describe the isolation of mouse beta-NGF complementary DNA (cDNA) and present its nucleotide sequence, which predicts a prepro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 27,000 (27K) and a pro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 25K. We have used the mouse beta-NGF cDNA clone to isolate the human beta-NGF gene, the coding regions of which are highly homologous to the mouse prepro-beta-NGF nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

retinitis pigment	RP	Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Mutations in the genes encoding two proteins of the retinal rod phototransduction cascade, opsin and the beta subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in some families. Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lys139End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.
striatum - enriched phospha	STEP	Molecular cloning of the human homolog of a striatum-enriched phosphatase (STEP) gene and chromosomal mapping of the human and murine loci. A gene for a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR amplification. Sequence analysis revealed that the PTPase has a single phosphatase catalytic domain located at the C-terminus that includes the highly conserved amino acid domain [I/V]HCXAGXXR[S/T]GX[F/Y] found in all tyrosine phosphatases. Two proline-rich regions located at the N-terminus may contain putative Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding motifs. Comparison of the PTPase with a previously cloned striatum enriched phosphatase (STEP) from rat and from mouse exhibited a high degree of identity (approximately 85-90%) at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels, indicating that the human PTPase is the homolog of the rat and murine STEP gene. By using a combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the human STEP locus to chromosome 11p15.2-p15.1 and the murine STEP gene to chromosome 7B3-B5. These are two regions of known conserved synteny, providing further evidence that the human STEP is a true homolog of the murine STEP gene. Candidate disease genes in the vicinity include Usher syndrome type 1C in human and a mouse mutant locus, twister (twt).

oligomycin sensitivity conferring	OSCP	Cloning of the cDNA for the human ATP synthase OSCP subunit (ATP5O) by exon trapping and mapping to chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2. Exon trapping was used to clone portions of potential genes from human chromosome 21. One trapped sequence showed striking homology with the bovine and rat ATP synthase OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) subunit. We subsequently cloned the full-length human ATP synthase OSCP cDNA (GDB/HGMW approved name ATP50) from infant brain and muscle libraries and determined its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence (EMBL/GenBank Accession No. X83218). The encoded polypeptide contains 213 amino acids, with more than 80% identity to bovine and murine ATPase OSCP subunits and over 35% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sweet potato sequences. The human ATP5O gene is located at 21q22.1-q22.2, just proximal to D21S17, in YACs 860G11 and 838C7 of the Chumakov et al. (Nature 359:380, 1992) YAC contig. The gene is expressed in all human tissues examined, most strongly in muscle and heart. This ATP5O subunit is a key structural component of the stalk of the mitochondrial respiratory chain F1F0-ATP synthase and as such may contribute in a gene dosage-dependent manner to the phenotype of Down syndrome (trisomy 21).
carbonic anhydrase	CA V	Genomic organization of the human gene (CA5) and pseudogene for mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase V and their localization to chromosomes 16q and 16p. Carbonic anhydrase V (CA V) is expressed in mitochondrial matrix in liver and several other tissues. It is of interest for its putative roles in providing bicarbonate to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for ureagenesis and to pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis and its possible importance in explaining certain inherited metabolic disorders with hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia. Following the recent characterization of the cDNA for human CA V, we report the isolation of the human gene from two lambda genomic libraries and its characterization. The CA V gene (CA5) is approximately 50 kb long and contains 7 exons and 6 introns. The exon-intron boundaries are found in positions identical to those determined for the previously described CA II, CA III, and CA VII genes. Like the CA VII gene, CA5 does not contain typical TATA and CAAT promoter elements in the 5' flanking region but does contain a TTTAA sequence 147 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. CA5 also contains a 12-bp GT-rich segment beginning 13 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal in the 3' untranslated region of exon 7. FISH analysis allowed CA5 to be assigned to chromosome 16q24.3. An unprocessed pseudogene containing sequence homologous to exons 3-7 and introns 3-6 was also isolated and was assigned by FISH analysis to chromosome 16p11.2-p12.
hereditary motor and sensory neuro	HMSN	De novo mutation of the myelin P0 gene in Dejerine-Sottas disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type III). We have investigated the myelin P0 gene on chromosome 1 as a candidate gene in two sporadic cases with Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III. We found different mutations, a cysteine substitution for serine 63 in the extracellular domain and an arginine substitution for glycine 167 in the transmembrane domain. The patients were genetically heterozygous for the normal allele and the mutant allele, which was absent in their parents and in one hundred unrelated, healthy controls. The results strongly suggest that a de novo dominant mutation of the P0 gene is responsible for at least some sporadic cases of Dejerine-Sottas disease.
guanine nucleotide - releasing	GNRP	C3G, a guanine nucleotide-releasing protein expressed ubiquitously, binds to the Src homology 3 domains of CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins. CRK protein, together with GRB2/ASH and Nck proteins, belongs to the adaptor-type Src homology (SH)2-containing molecules, which transduce signals from tyrosine kinases. Here another guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (GNRP), C3G, has been identified as a CRK SH3-binding protein. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.1-kb C3G cDNA contains a 3.2-kb open reading frame encoding a 121-kDa protein, and antibodies against C3G have been shown to detect a protein of 130-140 kDa. The carboxyl terminus of C3G has a peptide sequence homologous to GNRPs for Ras, and the expression of this carboxyl terminus region suppresses the loss of CDC25 function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C3G protein expressed in Escherichia coli binds to CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins. Mutational analysis of C3G assigns the SH3 binding region to a 50-amino acid region containing a proline-rich sequence. The mRNAs of both the C3G and CRK proteins are expressed ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues. The results of these studies suggest that the complex of CRK and C3G, or GRB2/ASH and C3G, may transduce the signals from tyrosine kinases to Ras in a number of different tissues.
nuclear localization	NLS	The immunoreactive region in a novel autoantigen contains a nuclear localization sequence. Antibodies in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases have been used to identify human autoantigens. Because autoantibodies often recognize active sites within corresponding protein antigens, autoantibodies have facilitated the functional characterization of these polypeptides. In the present study, serum from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome was used to identify a novel autoantigen which was designated Ge-1. Using the patient's serum, a 4.8-kb cDNA encoding Ge-1 was identified. Fragments of the cDNA were ligated into prokaryotic expression vectors, expressed in Escherichia coli, and used to produce recombinant Ge-1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins containing different portions of Ge-1 were used to identify a 58 amino acid immunoreactive region within the protein. This immunoreactive region contained the protein's putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To demonstrate that the immunoreactive region was capable of functioning as a NLS, a eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed to encode the immunoreactive region fused to the cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. After transfection of this plasmid into COS-1 cells, the fusion protein was detected in the nucleus. The presence of the NLS motif within the immunoreactive region of Ge-1 and other nuclear autoantigens suggests that the NLS may be a target of human autoantibodies.
apical plasma	APM	Vasopressin increases water permeability of kidney collecting duct by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels to plasma membrane. Water excretion by the kidney is regulated by the peptide hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin increases the water permeability of the renal collecting duct cells, allowing more water to be reabsorbed from collecting duct urine to blood. Despite long-standing interest in this process, the mechanism of the water permeability increase has remained undetermined. Recently, a molecular water channel (AQP-CD) has been cloned whose expression appears to be limited to the collecting duct. Previously, we immunolocalized this water channel to the apical plasma membrane (APM) and to intracellular vesicles (IVs) of collecting duct cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that vasopressin increases cellular water permeability by inducing exocytosis of AQP-CD-laden vesicles, transferring water channels from IVs to APM. Rat collecting ducts were perfused in vitro to determine water permeability and subcellular distribution of AQP-CD in the same tubules. The collecting ducts were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy before, during, and after exposure to vasopressin. Vasopressin exposure induced increases in water permeability and the absolute labeling density of AQP-CD in the APM. In parallel, the APM:IV labeling ratio increased. Furthermore, in response to vasopressin withdrawal, AQP-CD labeling density in the APM and the APM:IV labeling ratio decreased in parallel to a measured decrease in osmotic water permeability. We conclude that vasopressin increases the water permeability of collecting duct cells by inducing a reversible translocation of AQP-CD water channels from IVs to the APM.

Vasopressin increases the water permeability of the renal collecting duct cells, allowing more water to be reabsorbed from collecting duct urine to blood. Despite long-standing interest in this process, the mechanism of the water permeability increase has remained undetermined. Recently, a molecular water channel (AQP-CD) has been cloned whose expression appears to be limited to the collecting duct. Previously, we immunolocalized this water channel to the apical plasma membrane (APM) and to intracellular vesicles (IVs) of collecting duct cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that vasopressin increases cellular water permeability by inducing exocytosis of AQP-CD-laden vesicles, transferring water channels from IVs to APM. Rat collecting ducts were perfused in vitro to determine water permeability and subcellular distribution of AQP-CD in the same tubules. The collecting ducts were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy before, during, and after exposure to vasopressin. Vasopressin exposure induced increases in water permeability and the absolute labeling density of AQP-CD in the APM. In parallel, the APM:IV labeling ratio increased. Furthermore, in response to vasopressin withdrawal, AQP-CD labeling density in the APM and the APM:IV labeling ratio decreased in parallel to a measured decrease in osmotic water permeability. We conclude that vasopressin increases the water permeability of collecting duct cells by inducing a reversible translocation of AQP-CD water channels from IVs to the APM.
eph family of receptor protein tyrosine kinase	RPTKs	Characterization of a novel Src-like adapter protein that associates with the Eck receptor tyrosine kinase. The Eph family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) is the largest family of RPTKs. The signal transduction pathways initiated by this family have only recently begun to be explored. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Eck, it was previously shown that activated Eck RPTK bound to and stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pandey, A., Lazar, D.F., Saltiel, A. R., and Dixit, V.M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30154-30157). Also isolated from this same screen was a novel protein containing SH3 and SH2 adapter modules that had striking homology to those found in the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, unlike other Src family members, it lacked a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. Hence, this protein was designated SLAP for Src-like adapter protein. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion Proteins, it was demonstrated that SLAP bound to activated Eck receptor tyrosine kinase. Therefore, SLAP is a novel candidate downstream signaling intermediate and the first member of the Src family that resembles an adapter molecule.
short - chain alcohol dehydrogenase	SCAD	A nuclear protein, synthesized in growth-arrested human hepatoblastoma cells, is a novel member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family. We have described a protein (Hep27) [Donadel, G., Garzelli, C., Frank, R. & Gabrielli, F. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 723-729] which is synthesized and accumulated in the nucleus of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, following growth arrest induced by butyrate treatment. The synthesis of Hep27 is inhibited in cells that, released from the butyrate block, have resumed DNA synthesis. This report describes the cloning and the characterization of the cDNA coding for the Hep27 protein. The translation of the Hep27 cDNA predicts an amino acid sequence that can be aligned with those of the known short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes (SCAD) family. Both the recognition of enzymic functional domains and the similarity with the SCAD family of proteins of several amino acid blocks throughout the molecule, strongly suggest that this protein is a new member of the SCAD family. In agreement with its nuclear localization Hep27 has a region similar to the bipartite nuclear-targeting sequence. The study of Hep27 mRNA expression and protein synthesis suggests the existence of a regulation at the post-transcriptional level. The possible nuclear role of the Hep27 protein is discussed.
human papillomavirus	HPVs	Interaction of papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with a putative calcium-binding protein. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

src homology	SH2	Cloning and characterization of a G protein-activated human phosphoinositide-3 kinase. Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position.

kruppel - associated	KRAB	Repression of transcriptional activity by heterologous KRAB domains present in zinc finger proteins. We report the characterization of three novel members of the KRAB-domain containing C2-H2 zinc finger family (ZNF133, 136 and 140). KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain found N-terminally with respect to the zinc finger repeats that encodes the DNA binding domain. ZNF133 and ZNF140 have both the KRAB A- and KRAB B-boxes present at their N-terminus, whereas ZNF136 contains only the KRAB A-box. We have previously demonstrated that the KRAB domains derived from ZNF133 and ZNF140 are potent transcriptional repression domains [Margolin et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 4509-4513]. The KRAB domain from ZNF136, containing only subdomain A, is a considerable weaker suppression domain; however, when fused to the heterologous KRAB B subdomain of ZNF10 (KOX1) the two subdomains from a KRAB domain which induces repression as potently as previously reported KRAB domains.
carboxypeptidase	Cpe	Hyperproinsulinaemia in obese fat/fat mice associated with a carboxypeptidase E mutation which reduces enzyme activity. Mice homozygous for the fat mutation develop obesity and hyperglycaemia that can be suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin. The fat mutation maps to mouse chromosome 8, very close to the gene for carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), which encodes an enzyme (CPE) that processes prohormone intermediates such as proinsulin. We now demonstrate a defect in proinsulin processing associated with the virtual absence of CPE activity in extracts of fat/fat pancreatic islets and pituitaries. A single Ser202Pro mutation distinguishes the mutant Cpe allele, and abolishes enzymatic activity in vitro. Thus, the fat mutation represents the first demonstration of an obesity-diabetes syndrome elicited by a genetic defect in a prohormone processing pathway.
autosomal recessive muscular dystrop	SCARMD	Primary adhalinopathy: a common cause of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of variable severity. Marked deficiency of muscle adhalin, a 50 kDa sarcolemmal dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, has been reported in severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD). This is a Duchenne-like disease affecting both males and females first described in Tunisian families. Adhalin deficiency has been found in SCARMD patients from North Africa Europe, Brazil, Japan and North America (SLR & KPC, unpublished data). The disease was initially linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13 in families from North Africa, and to the adhalin gene itself on chromosome 17q in one French family in which missense mutations were identified. Thus there are two kinds of myopathies with adhalin deficiency: one with a primary defect of adhalin (primary adhalinopathies), and one in which absence of adhalin is secondary to a separate gene defect on chromosome 13. We have examined the importance of primary adhalinopathies among myopathies with adhalin deficiency, and describe several additional mutations (null and missense) in the adhalin gene in 10 new families from Europe and North Africa. Disease severity varies in age of onset and rate of progression, and patients with null mutations are the most severely affected.
macrophage inflammatory protein 1	MIP-1 alpha	Structure and functional expression of the human macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/RANTES receptor. The chemokine beta family is comprised of at least six distinct cytokines that regulate trafficking of phagocytes and lymphocytes in mammalian species; at least one of these, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), also regulates the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. We now show that MIP-1 alpha and the related beta chemokine, RANTES, induce transient alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can be reciprocally and specifically desensitized, suggesting a common receptor. Moreover, we have now cloned both the cDNA and the gene for this receptor, functionally expressed the receptor in Xenopus oocytes, and mapped the gene to human chromosome 3p21. Transcripts for the receptor were found in mature and immature myeloid cells as well as B cells. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It has approximately 33% amino acid identity with receptors for the alpha chemokine, interleukin 8, and may be the human homologue of the product of US28, an open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus.
cyclin - dependent kinase	Cdks	p57KIP2, a structurally distinct member of the p21CIP1 Cdk inhibitor family, is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are positive regulators of cell proliferation, whereas Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) inhibit proliferation. We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent. Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53. Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1. p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure. Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1. Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats. In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 mRNA displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye. Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation. Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it as a candidate tumor suppressor. The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development.

interleukin - 1 beta converting	ICE	A novel human protease similar to the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme induces apoptosis in transfected cells. We have identified a novel cDNA encoding a protein (named TX) with > 50% overall sequence identity with the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) and approximately 30% sequence identity with the ICE homologs NEDD-2/ICH-1L and CED-3. A computer homology model of TX was constructed based on the X-ray coordinates of the ICE crystal recently published. This model suggests that TX is a cysteine protease, with the P1 aspartic acid substrate specificity retained. Transfection experiments demonstrate that TX is a protease which is able to cleave itself and the p30 ICE precursor, but not to generate mature IL-1 beta from pro-IL-1 beta. In addition, this protein induces apoptosis in transfected COS cells. TX therefore delineates a new member of the growing Ice/ced-3 gene family coding for proteases with cytokine processing activity or involved in programmed cell death.
phosphatidylinositol -	PI-specific	The human E48 antigen, highly homologous to the murine Ly-6 antigen ThB, is a GPI-anchored molecule apparently involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. The E48 antigen, a putative human homologue of the 20-kD protein present in desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein III (dg4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of squamous cell carcinoma in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in carcinogenesis, we set out to molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone encoding the E48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13,286 kD. Database searching showed that the E48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB antigen, a member of the Ly-6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific (PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E48 antigen is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding the E48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 8 in the 8q24-qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV40-polyoma transformed mouse NIH/3T3 cells with the E48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion.
fibulin -	FBLN2	Fibulin-2 (FBLN2): human cDNA sequence, mRNA expression, and mapping of the gene on human and mouse chromosomes. Fibulin-2 is a new extracellular matrix protein that we recently identified by characterizing mouse cDNA clones. Fibulin-2 mRNA is prominently expressed in mouse heart tissue and is present in low amounts in other tissues. In this study, we isolated and sequenced a 4.1-kb human fibulin-2 cDNA, which encoded a mature protein of 1157 amino acids preceded by a 27-residue signal sequence. The predicted polypeptide contains three consecutive anaphylatoxin-related segments (domain I) in its central region followed by 10 EGF-like repeats (domain II), 9 of which have a consensus sequence for calcium binding. The 408-residue N-terminal region consists of two separate subdomains, a cysteine-rich segment of 150 residues (Na subdomain) and a cysteine-free segment with a stretch of acidic amino acids (Nb subdomain). The 115-residue C-terminal segment (domain III) is similar to the C variant of fibulin-1. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse fibulin-2 share approximately 90% identity in domains Na, I, II, and III but only 62% identity in domain Nb. The human cDNA lacks an EGF-like repeat, which is alternatively spliced in the mouse cDNA clones, and a potential cell-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found in the Nb domain of the mouse counterpart. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from various human tissues reveals an abundant 4.5-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and ovary tissue. The expression pattern differs from that of fibulin-1. The fibulin-2 gene was localized by in situ hybridization to the p24-p25 region of human chromosome 3 and to the band D-E of mouse chromosome 6.
tata - binding	TBP	Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

human cytoplasmic 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme	HMG-CoA	Human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase: expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant wild-type and Cys129 mutant enzymes. A cDNA for the human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) was subcloned and expressed from a T7-based vector in Escherichia coli. The over-produced enzyme was purified using a three-step protocol that generated 20 to 30 mg protein/liter cell culture. The physical and catalytic properties of the recombinant synthase are similar to those reported for the nonrecombinant enzymes from chicken liver 3Clinkenbeard et al. (1975a) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3124-3135] and rat liver [Mehrabian et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16249-16255]. Mutation of Cys129 to serine or alanine destroys HMG-CoA synthase activity by disrupting the first catalytic step in HMG-CoA synthesis, enzyme acetylation by acetyl coenzyme A. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type enzyme, neither mutant was capable of covalent modification by the beta-lactone inhibitor, L-659,699 [Greenspan et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7488-7492]. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition by L-659,699 revealed that this compound is a potent inhibitor of the recombinant human synthase, with an inhibition constant of 53.7 nM and an inactivation rate constant of 1.06 min-1.
neural cell adhesion molecule l	L1	X-linked spastic paraplegia (SPG1), MASA syndrome and X-linked hydrocephalus result from mutations in the L1 gene. X-linked hydrocephalus, spastic paraplegia type I and MASA syndrome are related disorders with loci in subchromosomal region Xq28. We have previously shown that X-linked hydrocephalus is caused by mutations in the gene for neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), an axonal glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration and differentiation. Here we report mutations of the L1 gene in MASA syndrome and SPG1, in addition to HSAS families. Two of the HSAS mutations would abolish cell surface expression of L1 and represent the first functional null mutations in this disorder. Our results indicate that these three syndromes from part of a clinical spectrum resulting from a heterogeneous group of mutations in the L1 gene.
protein kinase	PKC	Bradykinin induces translocation of the protein kinase C isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta. Bradykinin exerts a broad spectrum of cellular effects on different tissues. It is believed that these effects are predominantly mediated by the recently cloned B2 receptor. The mechanism of post-receptor signal transduction is not known in detail. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) was suggested and activation of the classical PKC isoforms alpha and beta was recently demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the B2 receptor also activates new (delta, epsilon) and atypical (zeta) PKC isoforms. To investigate this, chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with human B2 receptor, were used. In these cells the PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon and zeta were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. To monitor hormone-induced PKC translocation plasma membranes were prepared. Stimulation of the cells with bradykinin resulted in a rapid (30-60 s) translocation of the PKC isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta. Translocation of PKC delta was not detected. The effect of bradykinin was reduced by simultaneous addition of the receptor antagonist HOE 140, a bradykinin-related decapeptide. The data show that the B2 receptor in this cell model is able to activate, in addition to the classical PKC isoform alpha, the new PKC isoform epsilon and the atypical PKC isoform zeta. To test whether these effects are as well observed in a non-transfected cell, the experiments were repeated in human foreskin fibroblasts which naturally express high levels of B2 receptors. In this cell system similar results on PKC alpha, epsilon, and zeta were observed, suggesting that all three PKC isoforms are involved in signal transduction of the B2 receptor.

fetal antigen	FA1	Protein structure of fetal antigen 1 (FA1). A novel circulating human epidermal-growth-factor-like protein expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and its relation to the gene products of dlk and pG2. The present paper describes the primary structure, glycosylation and tissue localization of fetal antigen 1 (FA1) isolated from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. FA1 is a single-chained, heterogeneous glycoprotein of 225-262 amino acid residues. FA1 has six well conserved epidermal-growth-factor motifs and contains up to ten O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites, six of which are differentially glycosylated. Alignment to the translated sequences of Mus. musculus dlk and human dlk revealed 86% and 99% identity, respectively, to a 259-amino-acid residue overlap, and this high similarity extends with minor corrections to the human adrenal-specific mRNA, pG2 as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of FA1 in 10 out of 14 lung tumors containing neuroendocrine elements, and in the placental villi where FA1 was exclusively seen in stromal cells in close contact to the vascular structure. In the pancreas, FA1 co-localized with insulin in the insulin secretory granules of the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Our findings suggest that FA1 is synthesized as a membrane anchored protein and released into the circulation after enzymic cleavage, and that circulating FA1 represents the post-translationally modified gene product of human dlk which, in turn, is identical to human adrenal-specific mRNA pG2.

human dna helicase	HDH II	Human DNA helicase II: a novel DNA unwinding enzyme identified as the Ku autoantigen. Human DNA helicase II (HDH II) is a novel ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzyme, purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells, which (i) unwinds exclusively DNA duplexes, (ii) prefers partially unwound substrates and (iii) proceeds in the 3' to 5' direction on the bound strand. HDH II is a heterodimer of 72 and 87 kDa polypeptides. It shows single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as well as double-stranded DNA binding capacity. All these activities comigrate in gel filtration and glycerol gradients, giving a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4S and a Stokes radius of approximately 46 A, corresponding to a native molecular weight of 158 kDa. The antibodies raised in rabbit against either polypeptide can remove from the solution all the activities of HDH II. Photoaffinity labelling with [alpha-32P]ATP labelled both polypeptides. Microsequencing of the separate polypeptides of HDH II and cross-reaction with specific antibodies showed that this enzyme is identical to Ku, an autoantigen recognized by the sera of scleroderma and lupus erythematosus patients, which binds specifically to duplex DNA ends and is regulator of a DNA-dependent protein kinase. Recombinant HDH II/Ku protein expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells showed DNA binding and helicase activities indistinguishable from those of the isolated protein. The exclusively nuclear location of HDH II/Ku antigen, its highly specific affinity for double-stranded DNA, its abundance and its newly demonstrated ability to unwind exclusively DNA duplexes, point to an additional, if still unclear, role for this molecule in DNA metabolism.
upstream stimulatory	USA	Purification, cloning, and characterization of a human coactivator, PC4, that mediates transcriptional activation of class II genes. Activator-dependent transcription in mammalian cells requires upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived cofactors in addition to those present in TFIID. A novel positive cofactor (PC4) purified from the human USA fraction effected a marked enhancement (up to 85-fold) of GAL4-AH-dependent transcription in conjunction with TFIID and other general factors. Isolation of a corresponding cDNA identified PC4 as a 127 residue single-stranded DNA-binding protein with serine-rich regions near the N-terminus. Recombinant PC4 was functionally equivalent to native PC4, and both proteins markedly enhanced activation by diverse activation domains fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. Recombinant PC4 interacted independently both with free or DNA-bound VP16 activation domains and with free or DNA-bound TFIIA-TBP complexes (but not with TBP alone). These results indicate that PC4 is a general coactivator that functions cooperatively with TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream activators and the general transcriptional machinery.
None	NNMT	Human liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. cDNA cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.
replication factor	RFC	cDNAs encoding the large subunit of human replication factor C. Replication factor C (RFC) is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. Previous studies have shown that RFC is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3' end of a primer hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the 140-kDa component of this multisubunit complex. Here, the isolation and analysis of cDNAs encoding this subunit is described. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed an open reading frame of 3.4 kb, encoding an 1148-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. A putative ATP-binding motif was observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial and viral origin. A " DEAD " box is also conserved among these proteins. The predicted protein shows significant identity with a DNA-binding protein of murine origin (B. Luckow, P. Lichter, and G. Schütz, personal communication). Regions of similarity were also seen between the amino acid sequences of the 140-kDa subunit of RFC, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bacterial DNA ligases--possibly representing a conserved structural feature of these proteins that bind similar DNA substrates.
estrogen	ER	Genomic binding-site cloning reveals an estrogen-responsive gene that encodes a RING finger protein. Estrogen receptor (ER)-binding fragments were isolated from human genomic DNA by using a recombinant ER protein. Using one of these fragments as a probe, we have identified an estrogen-responsive gene that encodes a putative zinc finger protein. It has a RING finger motif present in a family of apparent DNA-binding proteins and is designated estrogen-responsive finger protein (efp). efp cDNA contains a consensus estrogen-responsive element at the 3' untranslated region that can act as a downstream estrogen-dependent enhancer. Moreover, efp is regulated by estrogen as demonstrated at both the mRNA and the protein level in ER-positive cells derived from mammary gland. These data suggest that efp may represent an estrogen-responsive transcription factor that mediates phenotypic expression of the diverse estrogen action. Thus, the genomic binding-site cloning may be applicable for isolation of the target genes of other transcription factors.

alzheimer	AD	Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding an unrecognized component of amyloid in Alzheimer disease. A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread amyloid deposition. We analyzed the entire amino acid sequences in an amyloid preparation and found, in addition to the major beta/A4-protein (A beta) fragment, two unknown peptides. We raised antibodies against synthetic peptides using subsequences of these peptides. These antibodies immunostained amyloid in neuritic and diffuse plaques as well as vascular amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunostaining was localized on amyloid fibrils. We have isolated an apparently full-length cDNA encoding a 140-amino-acid protein within which two previously unreported amyloid sequences are encoded in tandem in the most hydrophobic domain. We tentatively named this 35-amino acid peptide NAC (non-A beta component of AD amyloid) and its precursor NACP. NAC is the second component, after A beta, identified chemically in the purified AD amyloid preparation. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the NAC peptide sequence has a strong tendency to form beta-structures consistent with its association with amyloid. NACP is detected as a M(r) 19,000 protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain homogenates and comigrates on immunoblots with NACP synthesized in Escherichia coli from NACP cDNA. NACP mRNA is expressed principally in brain but is also expressed in low concentrations in all tissues examined except in liver, suggesting its ubiquitous and brain-specific functions. The availability of the cDNA encoding full-length NACP should help to elucidate the mechanisms of amyloidosis in AD.
fluorescence in situ hybrid	FISH	Chromosomal localization of genes encoding the transcription factors, c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to perform precise chromosomal mapping of the genes encoding the transcription factors c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10. The previously published assignments of c-rel and NF-kappa Bp50 have been refined to specific bands. The map position of lyt-10, inferred from its isolation from a t(10;14)(q24;q32) translocation, has been confirmed. NF-kappa Bp65 has now been mapped to 11q13, a site of frequent involvement in aberration in multiple tumor types.
oligodeoxyribonucle	oligo	Cloning, sequencing and expression of a cDNA encoding mammalian valyl-tRNA synthetase. A fragment of the cDNA encoding a rat valyl-tRNA synthetase (TrsVal)-like protein was cloned from a rat cDNA library in lambda gt11 using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) probe. Three independent plaque clones containing the human TrsVal cDNA were then isolated from a lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cDNA library using the rat cDNA fragment as the hybridization probe. Sequence analyses of the cDNA fragments provided a 3.2-kb sequence with an open reading frame that contained the 'HIGH' synthetase signature sequence and the tRNA 3'-end-binding motif, KMSKS, and putative Val-binding motif, EWCISRQ. The sequence was extended to the 3' end of the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction using an internal primer and an oligo(dT) adapter. The deduced 1051-amino-acid sequence shares 65% identity with yeast TrsVal, and contains a highly basic N-terminal region, a newly evolved protease-sensitive region in sequence close to the C terminus, and several sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation. A 3-kb cDNA fragment was sub-cloned into plasmid pSVL and expressed in COS-7 cells; up to a sevenfold increase in TrsVal activity was obtained. These results confirm the cloning and sequencing of a human TrsVal-encoding cDNA.
calmodulin - like	CLP	Localization of the intronless gene coding for calmodulin-like protein CLP to human chromosome 10p13-ter. The functional intronless gene coding for a calmodulin-like protein (CLP) has been localized to human chromosome 10p13-ter. Chromosomal assignment was performed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and amplification of a CLP gene-specific 1090-bp DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA from human-hamster cell hybrids. Chromosomal sublocalization was carried out by in situ hybridization of human chromosome metaphase spreads. The CLP gene is the first member of the human calmodulin/calmodulin-like gene family to be chromosomally sublocalized. Its presence near the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 10 may be of significance with respect to its highly (epithelial) cell-type restricted expression in vivo and strong downregulation upon malignant transformation. The generation of a human CLP gene-specific sequence tag site specified by the two primers used for PCR should prove useful for future linkage studies.

leukotriene b	LTB4	A novel form of cytochrome P-450 family 4 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. cDNA cloning and expression of leukotriene B4 omega-hydroxylase. Isolation of cDNA clones for human leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase clearly demonstrates that the hydroxylase is a member of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) superfamily. cDNA clones isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library with CYP4A4 cDNA as a probe encode a protein of 520 amino acids with a molecular weight of 59,805. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an invariant cysteine in the conserved heme-binding domain near the C terminus, characteristic of the P-450 superfamily. The microsomes from yeast cells transfected with an expression vector pAAH5 carrying isolated cDNA catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4 with a Km value of 0.71 microM, and its activity was significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide and by antisera against CYP4A4, consistent with the properties previously reported with LTB4 omega-hydroxylase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The amino acid sequence of LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (P-450LTB omega) shows 31-44% similarity to those of CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4C, whereas less than 25% similarity was observed with any of the other P-450 families. According to the systematic classification of the P-450 superfamily, P-450LTB omega is classified into the CYP4 family but does not belong to any of the known CYP4 subfamilies. This P-450 composes a new subfamily of CYP4. RNA blot analysis indicated that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA was expressed in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as leukocytes from four individuals. Isolation of the cDNA opens the way to investigate the physiological role and to regulation of the omega-hydroxylase in the inflammation process.

human electron - transferring flavoprot	ETF	cDNA cloning and mitochondrial import of the beta-subunit of the human electron-transfer flavoprotein. We have isolated a cDNA clone which encodes the entire beta-subunit of human electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) by screening an expression library from human liver using polyclonal antibodies against porcine ETF. This cDNA encodes a protein of 255 amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 27,877 Da which shows a high degree of similarity with partial amino-acid sequences obtained from both rat liver and Paracoccus denitrificans beta-ETF. Northern-blot analysis shows that the human beta-ETF mRNA is approximately 1 kb in size and is abundant in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. Incubation with intact mitochondria indicates that the cDNA-encoded beta-ETF polypeptide contains the information necessary to reach the mitochondrial matrix. These data are in agreement with previous experiments suggesting that beta-ETF, unlike the majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix proteins, does not have a cleavable leader peptide. Furthermore, when valinomycin is added to the incubation mixture, the import is abolished, thus demonstrating that it is an energy-dependent process. Interestingly, the sequence analysis of beta-ETF protein identifies a 26.3% identity with the Fix A gene product of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azorhizobium caulinodans.
serine hydroxymethyltransfera	SHMT	Cloning of human cDNAs encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferases and chromosomal localization. Human cDNAs for cytosolic and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) were cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glyA mutant with a human cDNA library. The cDNA for the cytosolic enzyme encodes a 483-residue protein of M(r) 53,020. The cDNA for the mitochondrial enzyme encodes a mature protein of 474 residues of M(r) 52,400. The deduced protein sequences share a high degree of sequence identity to each other (63%), and the individual isozymes are highly homologous to the analogous rabbit liver cytosolic (92% identity) and mitochondrial (97% identity) SHMT isozymes (Martini, F., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5499-5509; Martini, F., Maras, B., Tanci, P., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8509-8519). SHMT is a highly conserved protein with the human isozymes retaining about 43% sequence identity with the E. coli protein. The human cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT genes were localized to chromosome regions 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the two isozymes, and the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions, is consistent with these regions of chromosome 12 and 17 arising by a duplication event.
calcineuri	CaN	Crystal structures of human calcineurin and the human FKBP12-FK506-calcineurin complex. Calcineurin (CaN) is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphate which is critical for several important cellular processes, including T-cell activation. CaN is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit CaN after forming complexes with cytoplasmic binding proteins (cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively). We report here the crystal structures of full-length human CaN at 2.1 A resolution and of the complex of human CaN with FKBP12-FK506 at 3.5 A resolution. In the native CaN structure, an auto-inhibitory element binds at the Zn/Fe-containing active site. The metal-site geometry and active-site water structure suggest a catalytic mechanism involving nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate by a metal-activated water molecule. In the FKBP12-FK506-CaN complex, the auto-inhibitory element is displaced from the active site. The site of binding of FKBP12-FK506 appears to be shared by other non-competitive inhibitors of calcineurin, including a natural anchoring protein.
macrophage inflammatory	MIP	HCC-1, a novel chemokine from human plasma. A novel CC chemokine, HCC-1, was isolated from the hemofiltrate of patients with chronic renal failure. HCC-1 has a relative molecular mass of 8,673 and consists of 74 amino acids including four cysteines linked to disulfide bonds. HCC-1 cDNA was cloned from human bone marrow and shown to code for the mature protein plus a putative 19-residue leader sequence. Mature HCC-1 has sequence identity of 46% with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, and 29-37% with the other human CC chemokines. Unlike MIP-1 alpha and the other CC chemokines, HCC-1 is expressed constitutively in several normal tissues (spleen, liver, skeletal and heart muscle, gut, and bone marrow), and is present at high concentrations (1-80 nM) in plasma. HCC-1 has weak activities on human monocytes and acts via receptors that also recognize MIP-1 alpha. It induced intracellular Ca2+ changes and enzyme release, but no chemotaxis, at concentrations of 100-1,000 nM, and was inactive on T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophil leukocytes. In addition, HCC-1 enhanced the proliferation of CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells. It was as effective as MIP-1 alpha, but about 100-fold less potent.
acute lymphoblastic leukemia	ALLs	LAF-4 encodes a lymphoid nuclear protein with transactivation potential that is homologous to AF-4, the gene fused to MLL in t(4;11) leukemias. A novel human gene, LAF-4, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library that showed strong sequence similarity to AF-4, a gene that is translocated in t(4;11)(q21;q23) acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.
human	Chr	A human ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, L-UBC, maps in the Alzheimer's disease locus on chromosome 14q24.3. We have identified a novel ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene, L-UBC, which maps to human Chromosome (Chr) 14q24.3. This is also the location of the major early onset familial Alzheimer's disease gene (FAD3). L-UBC encodes a protein that demonstrates homology to the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-4, and human UbcH5. Their functions are to ubiquitinate specific proteins targeted for degradation. The protein also exhibits very strong homology to a rabbit protein, E2-F1, which mediates p53 degradation driven by papilloma virus E6 protein in vitro. The accumulation of specific proteins that have undergone aberrant processing in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques is the classic pathological feature in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Abnormal ubiquitination has previously been suggested to play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. This gene therefore represents a plausible candidate gene for FAD3.
rat brain phosphodiesterase i / nucleotide pyrophospha	PD-I alpha	Cloning, chromosomal localization, and tissue expression of autotaxin from human teratocarcinoma cells. Autotaxin, a potent human tumor cell motility-stimulating exophosphodiesterase, was isolated and cloned from the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera2D1. The deduced amino acid sequence for the teratocarcinoma autotaxin has 94% identity to the melanoma-derived protein, 90% identity to rat brain phosphodiesterase I/nucleotide pyrophosphatase (PD-I alpha), and 44% identity to the plasma cell membrane marker PC-I. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction screening of the CEPH YAC library, we localized the autotaxin gene to human chromosome 8q23-24. Northern blot analysis of relative mRNA from multiple human tissues revealed that autotaxin mRNA steady state expression is most abundant in brain, placenta, ovary, and small intestine.
methyl methanesulfo	MMS	Molecular cloning and functional analysis of a human cDNA encoding an Escherichia coli AlkB homolog, a protein involved in DNA alkylation damage repair. The Escherichia coli AlkB protein is involved in protecting cells against mutation and cell death induced specifically by SN2-type alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). A human cDNA encoding a polypeptide homologous to E.coli AlkB was discovered by searching a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from high throughput cDNA sequencing. The full-length human AlkB homolog (hABH) cDNA clone contains a 924 bp open reading frame encoding a 34 kDa protein which is 52% similar and 23% identical to E.coli AlkB. The hABH gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24, was ubiquitously expressed in 16 human tissues examined. When hABH was expressed in E.coli alkB mutant cells partial rescue of the cells from MMS-induced cell death occurred. Under the conditions used expression of hABH in skin fibroblasts was not regulated by treatment with MMS. Our findings show that the AlkB protein is structurally and functionally conserved from bacteria to human, but its regulation may have diverged during evolution.

murine rab8 - interacting	rab8ip	In its active form, the GTP-binding protein rab8 interacts with a stress-activated protein kinase. Rab8 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (MDCK), and to the dendritic surface in hippocampal neurons. As is the case for most other rab proteins, the precise molecular interactions by which rab8 carries out its function remain to be elucidated. Here we report the identification and the complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of a murine rab8-interacting protein (rab8ip) that specifically interacts with rab8 in a GTP-dependent manner. Rab8ip displays 93% identity with the GC kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase recently identified in human lymphoid tissue that is activated in the stress response. Like the GC kinase, rab8ip has protein kinase activity manifested by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the classical serine/threonine protein kinase substrates, myelin basic protein and casein. When coexpressed in transfected 293T cells, rab8 and the rab8ip/GC kinase formed a complex that could be recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to rab8. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses indicate that in MDCK cells endogenous rab8ip is present both in the cytosol and as a peripheral membrane protein concentrated in the Golgi region and basolateral plasma membrane domains, sites where rab8 itself is also located. In light of recent evidence that rab proteins may act by promoting the stabilization of SNARE complexes, the specific GTP-dependent association of rab8 with the rab8ip/GC kinase raises the possibility that rab-regulated protein phosphorylation is important for vesicle targeting or fusion. Moreover, the rab8ip/GC kinase may serve to modulate secretion in response to stress stimuli.
None	hVMAT	Distinct pharmacological properties and distribution in neurons and endocrine cells of two isoforms of the human vesicular monoamine transporter. A second isoform of the human vesicular monoamine transporter (hVMAT) has been cloned from a pheochromocytoma cDNA library. The contribution of the two transporter isoforms to monoamine storage in human neuroendocrine tissues was examined with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against hVMAT1 and hVMAT2. Central, peripheral, and enteric neurons express only VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed exclusively in neuroendocrine, including chromaffin and enterochromaffin, cells. VMAT1 and VMAT2 are coexpressed in all chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. VMAT2 alone is expressed in histamine-storing enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. The transport characteristics and pharmacology of each VMAT isoform have been directly compared after expression in digitonin-permeabilized fibroblastic (CV-1) cells, providing information about substrate feature recognition by each transporter and the role of vesicular monoamine storage in the mechanism of action of psychopharmacologic and neurotoxic agents in human. Serotonin has a similar affinity for both transporters. Catecholamines exhibit a 3-fold higher affinity, and histamine exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity, for VMAT2. Reserpine and ketanserin are slightly more potent inhibitors of VMAT2-mediated transport than of VMAT1-mediated transport, whereas tetrabenazine binds to and inhibits only VMAT2. N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine are all more potent inhibitors of VMAT2 than of VMAT1, whereas fenfluramine is a more potent inhibitor of VMAT1-mediated monamine transport than of VMAT2-mediated monoamine transport. The unique distributions of hVMAT1 and hVMAT2 provide new markers for multiple neuroendocrine lineages, and examination of their transport properties provides mechanistic insights into the pharmacology and physiology of amine storage in cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system function.
androgen	AR	Cloning and characterization of a specific coactivator, ARA70, for the androgen receptor in human prostate cells. The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation. Mutations or abnormal expression of AR in prostate cancer can play a key role in the process that changes prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to isolate a ligand-dependent AR-associated protein (ARA70), which functions as an activator to enhance AR transcriptional activity 10-fold in the presence of 10(-10) M dihydrotestosterone or 10(-9) M testosterone, but not 10(-6) M hydroxyflutamide in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Our data further indicated that ARA70 Will only slightly induce the transcriptional activity of other steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor in DU145 cells. Together, these data suggest that AR may need a specific coactivator(s) such as ARA70 for optimal androgen activity.
metalloprotease / disintegrin / cysteine - rich protein	MDC9	MDC9, a widely expressed cellular disintegrin containing cytoplasmic SH3 ligand domains. Cellular disintegrins are a family of proteins that are related to snake venom integrin ligands and metalloproteases. We have cloned and sequenced the mouse and human homologue of a widely expressed cellular disintegrin, which we have termed MDC9 (for metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein 9). The deduced mouse and human protein sequences are 82% identical. MDC9 contains several distinct protein domains: a signal sequence is followed by a prodomain and a domain with sequence similarity to snake venom metalloproteases, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF repeat, a membrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of MDC9 has two proline-rich sequences which can bind the SH3 domain of Src, and may therefore function as SH3 ligand domains. Western blot analysis shows that MDC9 is an approximately 84-kD glycoprotein in all mouse tissues examined, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblast and C2C12 myoblast mouse cell lines. MDC9 can be both cell surface biotinylated and 125I-labeled in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, indicating that the protein is present on the plasma membrane. Expression of MDC9 in COS-7 cells yields an 84-kD protein, and immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 cells expressing MDC9 shows a staining pattern that is consistent with a plasma membrane localization. The apparent molecular mass of 84 kD suggests that MDC9 contains a membrane-anchored metalloprotease and disintegrin domain. We propose that MDC9 might function as a membrane-anchored integrin ligand or metalloprotease, or that MDC9 may combine both activities in one protein.
glycine	GlyR	A GLRA1 null mutation in recessive hyperekplexia challenges the functional role of glycine receptors. Dominant missense mutations in the human glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit gene (GLRA1) give rise to hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations impair agonist affinities and change conductance states of expressed mutant channels, resulting in a partial loss of function. In a recessive case of hyperekplexia, we found a deletion of exons 1-6 of the GLRA1 gene. Born to consanguineous parents, the affected child is homozygous for this GLRA1(null) allele consistent with a complete loss of gene function. The child displayed exaggerated startle responses and pronounced head-retraction jerks reflecting a disinhibition of vestigial brain-stem reflexes. In contrast, proprio- and exteroceptive inhibition of muscle activity previously correlated to glycinergic mechanisms were not affected. This case demonstrates that, in contrast to the lethal effect of a null allele in the recessive mouse mutant oscillator (Glra1 spd-ot), the loss of the GlyR alpha 1 subunit is effectively compensated in man.

tumor necrosis	TNF	Induction of apoptosis by Apo-2 ligand, a new member of the tumor necrosis factor cytokine family. Cytokines in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family regulate development and function of the immune system. We have isolated a new member of this family, designated Apo-2 ligand (Apo-2L), via an expressed sequence tag. Apo-2L is a 281-amino acid protein, related most closely to Fas/Apo-1 ligand. Transfected Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface with its C terminus exposed, indicating a type II transmembrane protein topology. Like Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, the C-terminal extracellular region of Apo-2L (amino acids 114-281) exhibits a homotrimeric subunit structure. Soluble Apo-2L induces extensive apoptosis in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tumor cell lines. The effect of Apo-2L is not inhibited by soluble Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors; moreover, expression of human Fas/Apo-1 in mouse fibroblasts, which confers sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 antibody, does not confer sensitivity to Apo-2L. Hence, Apo-2L acts via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. These results suggest that, along with other family members such as Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, Apo-2L may serve as an extracellular signal that triggers programmed cell death.

mammalian translation initiation factor	eIF-5	Characterization of multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) interacts with the 40 S initiation complex (40S.mRNA.MettRNAf.eIF-2.GTP) to promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP with the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex. In this paper, the multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian eIF-5 have been characterized. In rat tissues, three major eIF-5 mRNAs of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.2 kilobases in length are detected. All major eIF-5 mRNAs are initiated from a single transcription initiation site, contain identical 5'-untranslated and coding regions, but differ from one another only in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions. The different lengths of the 3'-untranslated region of eIF-5 mRNAs are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Additionally, we demonstrate tissue-specific variations in eIF-5 mRNA expression as well as preference for polyadenylation sites. These results should lead to increased understanding of the regulation of eIF-5 gene expression.

human cb	hCB2	Molecular cloning, expression and function of the murine CB2 peripheral cannabinoid receptor. We have cloned the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, mCB2, from a mouse splenocyte cDNA library. The 3.7 kb sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 347 residues sharing 82% overall identity with the only other known peripheral receptor, human CB2 (hCB2) and shorter than hCB2 by 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Binding experiments with membranes from COS-3 cells transiently expressing mCB2 showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55212-2 had a 6-fold lower affinity for mCB2 than for hCB2, whereas both receptors showed similar affinities for the agonists CP 55,940, delta(9)-THC and anandamide and almost no affinity for the central receptor- (CB1) specific antagonist SR 141716A. Both hCB2 and mCB2 mediate agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cell lines permanently expressing the receptors. SR 141716A failed to antagonize this activity in either cell line, confirming its specificity for CB1.
inhibitory glycine	GlyR	The human glycine receptor beta subunit: primary structure, functional characterisation and chromosomal localisation of the human and murine genes. The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric receptor comprised of alpha and beta subunits, of which the beta subunit has not been characterised in humans. A 2106 bp cDNA, isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library, contained an open reading frame of 497 amino acids which encodes the beta subunit of the human GlyR. The mature human GlyR beta polypeptide displays 99% amino acid identity with the rat GlyR beta subunit and 48% identity with the human GlyR alpha 1 subunit. Neither [3H]strychnine binding nor glycine-gated currents were detected when the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA was expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. However, co-expression of the beta subunit cDNA with the alpha 1 subunit cDNA resulted in expression of functional GlyRs which showed a 4-fold reduction in the EC50 values when compared to alpha 1 homomeric GlyRs. Glycine-gated currents of alpha 1/beta GlyRs were 17-fold less sensitive than homomeric alpha 1 GlyRs to the antagonists picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and picrotin, providing clear evidence that heteromeric alpha 1/beta GlyRs were expressed. The beta subunit appears to play a structural rather than ligand binding role in GlyR function. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to localise the gene encoding the human GlyR beta subunit (GLRB) to chromosome 4q32, a position syntenic with mouse chromosome 3. In situ hybridisation using the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA showed that the murine GlyR beta subunit gene (Glrb) maps to the spastic (spa) locus on mouse chromosome 3 at bands E3-F1. This is consistent with the recent finding that a mutation in the murine GlyR beta subunit causes the spa phenotype. It also raises the possibility that mutations in the human beta subunit gene may cause inherited disorders of the startle response.

chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybrid	FISH	Coding sequence and chromosome mapping of the human gene (CDC46) for replication protein hCdc46/Mcm5. We have isolated the complete cDNA sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein Cdc46/Mcm5. The cDNA was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which localized the human Cdc46 gene (CDC46) to chromosome region 22q13.1-->q13.2. This is the fourth human Mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human Mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. As deduced from the cDNA sequence, human protein hCdc46 is composed of 734 amino acids and contains a central region that is almost 80% identical with the yeast protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments with hCdc46-specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hCdc46 proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein P1Mcm3.
human immunodeficiency virus type	HIV-1	kappa opioid receptors in human microglia downregulate human immunodeficiency virus 1 expression. Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and recent studies suggest that opioid peptides regulate the function of macrophages from somatic tissues. We report herein the presence of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in human fetal microglia and inhibition of HIV-1 expression in acutely infected microglial cell cultures treated with KOR ligands. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we found that mRNA for the KOR was constitutively expressed in microglia and determined that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was identical to that of the human brain KOR gene. The expression of KOR in microglial cells was confirmed by membrane binding of [3H]U69,593, a kappa-selective ligand, and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of microglial cell cultures with U50,488 or U69,593 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the monocytotropic HIV-1 SF162 strain. This antiviral effect of the kappa ligands was blocked by the specific KOR antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine. These findings suggest that kappa opioid agonists have immunomodulatory activity in the brain, and that these compounds could have potential in the treatment of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy.

tumor - necrosis -	TNF	cDNA cloning and functional analysis of the p97 subunit of the 26S proteasome, a polypeptide identical to the type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated protein-2/55.11. Molecular cloning of cDNA for a new regulatory subunit, designated p97, of the human 26S proteasome showed that the polypeptide consists of 908 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 100184 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.94. Computer analysis showed that p97 is very similar to type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-2 and 55.11, both of which were identified recently as binding proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of type-1 TNF receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening. This finding suggests that the 26S proteasome might serve as a mediator molecule in the TNF signaling pathway in cells. Computer-assisted similarity analysis also revealed the high sequence similarity of p97 with a yeast protein whose function is yet unknown, the gene for which is here termed NAS1 (non-ATPase subunit 1). Disruption of NAS1 resulted in several phenotypes, including lethality and temperature-sensitive growth, depending on the genetic background of the cells used. The human p97 cDNA suppressed the growth defect of nas1 disruptant cells, when expressed from single-copy or multi-copy vectors, indicating that p97 is functionally equivalent to yeast Nas1p. Culturing of the temperature-sensitive nas1 cells at the restrictive temperature promoted the accumulation polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, implying that the 26S proteasome requires a functional Nas1p subunit for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results indicate that p97/Nas1p plays an important regulatory role in the function of the 26S proteasome.

human embryonal kinase	HEK2	Cell-cell adhesion mediated by binding of membrane-anchored ligand LERK-2 to the EPH-related receptor human embryonal kinase 2 promotes tyrosine kinase activity. Human embryonal kinase 2 (HEK2) is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is a member of the EPH family of receptors. Transcripts for HEK2 have a wide tissue distribution. Recently, a still growing family of ligands, which we have named LERKs, for ligands of the eph-related kinases, has been isolated. In order to analyze functional effects between the LERKs and the HEK2 receptor, we expressed HEK2 cDNA in an interleukin-3-dependent progenitor cell line 32D that grows as single cells in culture. Within the group of LERKs, LERK-2 and -5 were shown to bind to HEK2. Membrane-bound and soluble forms of LERK-2 were demonstrated to signal through HEK2 as judged by receptor phosphorylation. Coincubation of HEK2 and LERK-2 expressing cells induced cell-cell adhesion and formation of cell aggregates. This interaction could be inhibited by preincubation of HEK2 expressing cells with soluble LERK-2. Coexpression of HEK2 and LERK-2 in 32D cells showed reduced kinase activity and autophosphorylation of HEK2 compared with the juxtacrine stimulation, which seems to be due to a reduced sensitivity of the receptor.
tyrosine protein	TPK	Association of inhibitory tyrosine protein kinase p50csk with protein tyrosine phosphatase PEP in T cells and other hemopoietic cells. p50csk is a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) that represses the activity of Src family TPKs. We previously showed that Csk is a potent negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling in T lymphocytes and that its Src homology (SH) 3 and SH2 domains are required to inhibit these signals. To test the idea that the Csk SH3 and SH2 domains mediate interactions with other cellular proteins, we attempted to identify Csk-associated polypeptides using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results of our experiments demonstrated that Csk physically associates with PEP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) expressed in hemopoietic cells. Further analyses revealed that this interaction was mediated by the Csk SH3 domain and by a proline-rich region (PPPLPERTP) in the non-catalytic C-terminal portion of PEP. The association between Csk and PEP was documented in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells and in a variety of cells of hemopoietic lineages, including T cells. Additional analyses demonstrated that the association between Csk and PEP is highly specific. Together, these data indicated that PEP may be an effector and/or a regulator of p50csk in T cells and other hemopoietic cells. Moreover, they allowed the identification of PEP as the first known ligand for the Csk SH3 domain.

allograft inflammatory factor -	AIF-1	cDNA cloning of human allograft inflammatory factor-1: tissue distribution, cytokine induction, and mRNA expression in injured rat carotid arteries. We have previously identified a partial cDNA fragment obtained from rat carotid arteries subject to balloon angioplasty which is increased in response to vascular injury. We now report the isolation and characterization of a full length human clone which is 98% homologous at the amino acid level to the rat. Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1), a gene previously reported to be expressed in rat IFN gamma-activated macrophages. This transcript is expressed in low levels in undamaged, and increases 1 day and 3 days, and declines 7 days post balloon angioplasty. This human AIF-1 homologue is inducible in serum and cytokine-stimulated human smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, human tissue distribution indicates a constitutive expression in lymphoid tissue which can be augmented by mitogens. In summary, human AIF represents a cytokine inducible, tissue-specific, and highly conserved transcript transiently expressed in response to vascular trauma.
None	NK-3	Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists. In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.
None	3H	Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists.

c - type natriuretic	CNP	Molecular cloning and characterization of a transcription factor for the C-type natriuretic peptide gene promoter. Our previous studies on the promoter function of the human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) gene revealed the existence of two GC-rich cis elements essential for gene transcription in rat pituitary-derived GH3 cells. To isolate transcription factors that bind to those GC-rich elements, we screened a lambda ZAP cDNA library derived from GH3 cells by Southwestern screening. Several positive clones with specific binding abilities were obtained, and one was identical as TSC-22, a speculated transcriptional modulator stimulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) of unknown function. TSC-22 significantly enhanced CNP promoter activity in GH3 cells. We further cloned a 1.8-kb full-length human TSC-22 cDNA from a fetal kidney cDNA library by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends technique. In adults, human TSC-22 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, lung and heart. TSC-22 gene expression in GH3 and human aortic endothelial cells was stimulated by cytokines including TGF-beta, in correlation with the CNP mRNA increase. These results suggest that TSC-22 is a transcriptional regulator of the CNP gene and transmits signals from cytokines, such as TGF-beta, to CNP gene expression.

protein kinase	PKC	Isolation and characterization of a structural homologue of human PRK2 from rat liver. Distinguishing substrate and lipid activator specificities. A homologue of human protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase-2, PRK2, which had previously escaped identification in normal mammalian tissues, was isolated from rat liver as the protease-activated kinase (PAK) originally named PAK-2. The 130-kDa cytosolic enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown by tryptic peptide and reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-amplified rat cDNA sequence analyses to be structurally related to the 116-kDa rat hepatic PAK-1/protein kinase N (PKN) and, even more closely (95% sequence identity) to the 130-kDa human PKC-related kinase, PRK2. Rat myeloma RNA was used as the RT-PCR template because of its relative abundance in PAK-2/PRK2 mRNA compared with liver and other rat tissues. The catalytic properties of PAK-2/PRK2 in many respects resembled those of hepatic PAK-1/PKN, but were distinguished by more favorable kinetics with several peptide substrates, and greater sensitivity to PKC pseudosubstrate and polybasic amino acid inhibitors. PAK-2/PRK2 was also activated by lipids, particularly cardiolipin and to a lesser extent by other acidic phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids. Cardiolipin activation was most evident with autophosphorylation and histone H2B phosphorylation, but only marginally evident with the favored ribosomal S6-(229-239) peptide substrate for the protease-activated kinase activity. It was concluded that PAK-2 is the rat homologue of human PRK2, with biochemical properties distinct from although overlapping those of the PAK-1/PKN/PRK1 isoform.

osteoproteger	OPG	Osteoprotegerin: a novel secreted protein involved in the regulation of bone density. A novel secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone resorption has been identified. The protein, termed Osteoprotegerin (OPG), is a novel member of the TNF receptor superfamily. In vivo, hepatic expression of OPG in transgenic mice results in a profound yet nonlethal osteopetrosis, coincident with a decrease in later stages of osteoclast differentiation. These same effects are observed upon administration of recombinant OPG into normal mice. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant OPG. Furthermore, OPG blocks ovariectomy-associated bone loss in rats. These data show that OPG can act as a soluble factor in the regulation of bone mass and imply a utility for OPG in the treatment of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclast activity.
yeast artificial chromosome - fluorescence in situ hybrid	YAC-FISH	Isolation of a full-length human WNT7A gene implicated in limb development and cell transformation, and mapping to chromosome 3p25. The Wnt gene family has a role in development as well as tumourigenesis. One mouse member, Wnt7a, is vital for limb development in vivo and also possesses transforming ability in vitro. This study reports the isolation of a full length of human homologue of mouse Wnt7a gene by library screening. Yeast artificial chromosome-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (YAC-FISH) mapped the WNT7A gene to chromosome 3p25. Human WNT7A had an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 349 aa that exhibited 97% and 92% identity to mouse Wnt7a at the aa and nucleic acid levels, respectively. It possessed the 22 conserved cysteine residues and 3 more at the amino terminus, and a putative poly A tail. This is the fifth human WNT gene in which a complete cDNA sequence had been determined.
transient receptor	TRP	Coassembly of TRP and TRPL produces a distinct store-operated conductance. The Drosophila retinal-specific protein, TRP (transient receptor potential), is the founding member of a family of store-operated channels (SOCs) conserved from C. elegans to humans. In vitro studies indicate that TRP is a SOC, but that the related retinal protein, TRPL, is constitutively active. In the current work, we report that coexpression of TRP and TRPL leads to a store-operated, outwardly rectifying current distinct from that owing to either TRP or TRPL alone. TRP and TRPL interact directly, indicating that the TRP-TRPL-dependent current is mediated by heteromultimeric association between the two subunits. We propose that the light-activated current in photoreceptor cells is produced by a combination of TRP homo- and TRP-TRPL heteromultimers.

sry box -	SOX	SOX22 is a new member of the SOX gene family, mainly expressed in human nervous tissue. SOX (SRY box-containing) genes share a particular DNA-binding domain, called HMG, with the mammalian testis-determining gene SRY Several SOX genes have already been shown to be transcription factors involved in the decision of important cell fates during development. Here we report the cloning of a new human member of the SOX gene family, SOX22. The corresponding protein contains several domains that are also present in other paralogous SOX proteins. The SOX22 gene maps to chromosome 20 on band p13 and does not appear to be clustered with any other SOX gene mapped to date. SOX22 mRNA is expressed in various fetal and adult organs and tissues, suggesting that this gene plays roles in both differentiation and maintenance of several cell types.
drosophila retinal degeneration	rdgC	A novel human serine-threonine phosphatase related to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene is selectively expressed in sensory neurons of neural crest origin. Through our transcriptional mapping effort in the Xp22 region, we have isolated by exon trapping a new transcript highly homologous to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene. rdgC encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase protein and is required in Drosophila to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration. This human gene is the first mammalian member of the serine-threonine phosphatase with EF hand motif gene family, and was thus named PPEF (Protein Phosphatase with EF calcium-binding domain). The expression pattern of the mouse Ppef gene was studied by RNA in situ hybridization on embryonic tissue sections. While rdgC is expressed in the visual system of the fly, as well as in the mushroom bodies of the central brain, we found that Ppef is highly expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neural crest-derived cranial ganglia. The selective pattern of expression makes PPEF an important marker for sensory neuron differentiation and suggests a role for serine-threonine phosphatases in mammalian development.

7 , 8 - dihydro - 8 - oxoguan	8-oxoG	Cloning and characterization of hOGG1, a human homolog of the OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA glycosylase activity that is a functional analog of the Fpg protein from Escherichia coli and excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from damaged DNA. The repair of this ubiquitous kind of oxidative damage is essential to prevent mutations both in bacteria and in yeast. A human cDNA clone carrying an ORF displaying homology to the yeast protein was identified. The predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a molecular mass of 39 kDa. This protein shares a 38% sequence identity with the yeast Ogg1 protein, adding this novel human gene product to the growing family of enzymes that the repair of oxidatively damaged bases and are related to the E. coli endonuclease III. Northern blot analysis indicates that this gene, localized to chromosome 3p25, is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The cloned coding sequence was expressed in an E. coli strain that carried a disrupted fpg gene, the bacterial functional analog of OGG1. Cell-free extracts from these cultures displayed a specific lyase activity on duplex DNA that carried an 8-oxoG/C base pair. The products of the reaction are consistent with an enzymatic activity like the one displayed by the yeast Ogg1. Analysis of the substrate specificity reveals a very strong preference for DNA fragments harboring 8-oxoG/C base pairs. The pattern of specificity correlates well with the one found for the yeast enzyme. Moreover, when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in OGG1 it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. These results make this novel gene (hOGG1) a strong candidate for the human homolog of the yeast OGG1 and suggest an important role of its product in the protection of the genome from the mutagenic effects of the oxidatively damaged purines.
inhibitor - of - apop	IAP	X-linked IAP is a direct inhibitor of cell-death proteases. The inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) family of genes has an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in animals ranging from insects to humans. Ectopic expression of human IAP proteins can suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli, but the mechanism of this inhibition was previously unknown. Here we show that human X-chromosome-linked IAP directly inhibits at least two members of the caspase family of cell-death proteases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. As the caspases are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are the principal effectors of apoptosis, our findings suggest how IAPs might inhibit cell death, providing evidence for a mechanism of action for these mammalian cell-death suppressors.
fragile x mental retardation	FMRP	Differential expression of FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins in human brain and testis. Lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in mental retardation and macroorchidism, seen as the major pathological symptoms in fragile X patients. FMRP is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which cosediments with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Recently, two proteins homologous to FMRP were discovered: FXR1 and FXR2. These novel proteins interact with FMRP and with each other and they are also associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Here, we studied the expression pattern of the three proteins in brain and testis by immunohistochemistry. In adult brain, FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins are coexpressed in the cytoplasm of specific differentiated neurons only. However, we observed a different expression pattern in fetal brain as well as in adult and fetal testis, suggesting independent functions for the three proteins in those tissues during embryonic development and adult life.
pseudoautosomal	PAR	PHOG, a candidate gene for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. The abnormalities seen in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) presumably result from haploinsufficiency of certain genes on the X chromosome. Gene dosage considerations lead to the prediction that the culpable genes escape X inactivation and have functional homologs on the Y chromosome. Among the genes with these characteristics are those residing in the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) of the sex chromosomes. A pseudoautosomal location for a dosage-sensitive locus involved in stature has been suggested based on the analyses of patients with deletions of a specific segment of the short arm PAR; hemizygosity for this putative locus probably also contributes to the short stature in Turner individuals. We have isolated a gene from the critical deleted region that encodes a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor and is expressed at highest levels in osteogenic cells. We have named the gene PHOG, for pseudoautosomal homeobox-containing osteogenic gene. Its deletion in patients with short stature, the predicted altered dosage in 45,X individuals, along with the nature of the encoded protein and its expression pattern, make PHOG an attractive candidate for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. We have also found that the mouse homolog of PHOG is autosomal, which may help to explain the lack of a growth abnormality in mice with monosomy X.
signal transducers and activators of	STAT	cDNA cloning, expression and chromosome mapping of the human STAT4 gene: both STAT4 and STAT1 genes are mapped to 2q32.2-->q32.3. Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines have led to the identification of a family of proteins that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). STAT4 is phosphorylated following interleukin (IL)-12 stimulation and is essential for IL-12 signal transduction. The human STAT4 cDNA was cloned, and both STAT4 and STAT1 genes were mapped to human chromosome bands 2q32.2-->q32.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results suggest that STAT4 and STAT1 may have arisen via a tandem gene duplication. However, human STAT1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas human STAT4 is expressed in several tissues including spleen, heart, brain, peripheral blood cells, and testis.

g protein - coupled	GPCR	A beta-arrestin/green fluorescent protein biosensor for detecting G protein-coupled receptor activation. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent the single most important drug targets for medical therapy, and information from genome sequencing and genomic data bases has substantially accelerated their discovery. The lack of a systematic approach either to identify the function of a new GPCR or to associate it with a cognate ligand has added to the growing number of orphan receptors. In this work we provide a novel approach to this problem using a beta-arrestin2/green fluorescent protein conjugate (betaarr2-GFP). It provides a real-time and single cell based assay to monitor GPCR activation and GPCR-G protein-coupled receptor kinase or GPCR-arrestin interactions. Confocal microscopy demonstrates the translocation of betaarr2-GFP to more than 15 different ligand-activated GPCRs. These data clearly support the common hypothesis that the beta-arrestin binding of an activated receptor is a convergent step of GPCR signaling, increase by 5-fold the number of GPCRs known to interact with beta-arrestins, demonstrate that the cytosol is the predominant reservoir of biologically active beta-arrestins, and provide the first direct demonstration of the critical importance of G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation to the biological regulation of beta-arrestin activity and GPCR signal transduction in living cells. The use of betaarr2-GFP as a biosensor to recognize the activation of pharmacologically distinct GPCRs should accelerate the identification of orphan receptors and permit the optical study of their signal transduction biology intractable to ordinary biochemical methods.

hepatocyte growth	HGF	Purification and cloning of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2, a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator is a serine protease responsible for proteolytic activation of HGF in response to tissue injury and thus plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions of HGF in regenerating tissue. We previously purified an inhibitor of HGF activator (HGF activator inhibitor type 1, HAI-1) from the conditioned medium of a human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 and cloned its cDNA. HAI-1 is a novel member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. In the present study, we purified a second type of HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-2) from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The cDNA sequence revealed that HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and contains two Kunitz domains, indicating that HAI-2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. The primary translation product of HAI-2 has a hydrophobic sequence in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that, like HAI-1, HAI-2 is produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. Because HAI-2 and HAI-1 are potent inhibitors specific for HGF activator, they may be involved in regulation of proteolytic activation of HGF in injured tissues.

Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation phase of glycogen biosynthesis. A single mammalian gene had been reported to account for glycogen biogenesis in liver and muscle, the two major repositories of glycogen. We describe the characterization of novel forms of glycogenin, designated glycogenin-2 (GN-2), encoded by a second gene that is expressed preferentially in certain tissues, including liver, heart, and pancreas. Cloning of cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2 indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms (GN-2alpha, GN-2beta, and GN-2gamma) generated in part by alternative splicing. Overall, GN-2 has 40-45% identity to muscle glycogenin but is 72% identical over a 200-residue segment thought to contain the catalytic domain. GN-2 expressed in Escherichia coli or COS cells is active in self-glucosylation assays, and self-glucosylated GN-2 can be elongated by skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. Antibodies raised against GN-2 produced in E. coli recognized proteins of Mr approximately 66,000 present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. In H4IIEC3 cells, most of the GN-2 was present as a free protein but some was covalently associated with glycogen fractions and was only released by treatment with alpha-amylase. H4IIEC3 cells also expressed the muscle form of glycogenin (glycogenin-1), which was attached to a chromatographically separable glycogen fraction.
pulmonary alveolar protein	PAP	Human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with a defect in GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain expression. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous disorder of genetic or acquired etiologies. In some cases congenital PAP is associated with hereditary surfactant protein (SP)-B deficiency. To date, the molecular defect in the majority of patients with PAP has not been identified. In mice, PAP has been generated by targeted deletion of the genes for either the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (beta c) or GM-CSF. Here, we describe an expression defect of beta c in three of seven pediatric patients with PAP and in one patient with severe lung disease suspected to be PAP. The patients failed to express normal levels of beta c as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta c was demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays. Analysis of beta c DNA revealed a point mutation from proline to threonine at codon 602 in one patient. Our findings provide evidence that a defect in the expression of a hematopoietic cytokine receptor is associated with human PAP.

mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransfera	QPRTase	Characterization and functional expression of the cDNA encoding human brain quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase. Mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.19) is a key enzyme in catabolism of quinolinate, an intermediate in the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pathway. Quinolinate acts as a most potent endogenous exitotoxin to neurons. Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. As the first step to elucidate molecular basis underlying the quinolinate metabolism, the cDNA encoding human brain QPRTase was cloned and characterized. Utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney QPRTase, a human isolog was obtained from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a open reading frame of 297 amino acids, and shares 30 to 40% identity with those of bacterial QPRTases. To confirm that the cDNA clone encodes human QPRTase, its functional expression was studied in a bacterial host. Introduction of the human cDNA into a QPRTase defective (nadC) E. coli strain brought about an abrupt increase in QPRTase activity and allowed the cells to grow in the absence of nicotinic acid. It is concluded that the cloned cDNA encodes human QPRTase which is functional beyond the phylogenic boundary.

transmembrane 4 superfamily member	TM4SF5	Identification of a new tumour-associated antigen TM4SF5 and its expression in human cancer. In a previous large-scale screening for differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer, a gene was identified that was highly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer encoding a novel putative tetraspan transmembrane protein highly homologous to the tumour-associated antigen L6. Using a radiation hybrid panel the identified human gene named TM4SF5 (transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5) was localized to chromosome 17 in the region 17p13.3. The cloned TM4SF5 cDNA has a 32bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 591bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 85bp 3'UTR. The predicted TM4SF5 protein with 197 amino acids contains three NH2-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane regions, followed by an extracellular hydrophilic domain containing two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a COOH-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region. These structural features are shared by the L6 antigen and a number of related cell surface proteins associated with cell growth. TM4SF5 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues as compared to both normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis tissues, and was detected at high levels in other tumour tissues. Although the precise function of TM4SF5 remains to be elucidated it may be useful in a clinical setting for tumour diagnosis and/or therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the strong homology to the L6 antigen, which has proved promising in immunological, therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.

macrophage migration inhibitory	MIF	Molecular cloning of human D-dopachrome tautomerase cDNA: N-terminal proline is essential for enzyme activation. D-Dopachrome tautomerase converts 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (D-dopachrome) into 5,6-dihydroxyindole. This protein has an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has the potential to catalyze D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and is an important cytokine for T-lymphocyte activation. We isolated and sequenced a 566 bp-long cDNA encoding human D-dopachrome tautomerase. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 118 amino acids, including the initiator methionine. The amino acid sequence of the protein shares 80% homology with that of the rat enzyme. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA of D-dopachrome tautomerase is expressed in a large amount in the liver, and to lesser extent in other organs, including the heart, lung and pancreas. After purification of D-dopachrome tautomerase expressed in E. coli, we confirmed that the recombinant protein catalyzes the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. Its catalytic mechanism is not well understood. We found that the protein completely lost the enzyme activity when the N-terminal proline residue was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This fact suggests that the N-terminal proline is essential for the catalytic mechanism. Although the precise pathophysiological function of D-dopachrome tautomerase remains to be elucidated, the present results could contribute to further understanding of isomerase activity in relation to the immune response.
None	PAX	Isolation of full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 gene and identification of its human homologue. Recent genetic studies have suggested that PAX4, a member of the paired box (PAX) gene family, is involved in the mechanism regulating the fate of pancreatic islet endocrine progenitor cells. Murine PAX4 was originally identified by genomic screening and, to date, only a partial sequence of PAX4 has been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using RNA from MIN6 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. The full length of cDNA was 1.38 kb, consistent with the estimated size of the transcript by Northern blot. The deduced mouse PAX4 protein was 349 amino acids and had the predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. Two DNA binding motifs, a 128-amino acid paired domain and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain exhibit the highest amino acid homology with PAX6 (71.2%, 65.0%, respectively), another member of the PAX gene family. However, the sequence of the C-terminal segment of PAX4 diverged and showed no significant homology with any other known PAX genes. As to the genomic DNA, the coding region of the mouse PAX4 gene spanned approximately 5.5 kb and was composed of 10 exons. In the public DNA database, a human cosmid (g1572c264), which was localized on human chromosome 7q31.3, was found to contain a gene homologous to PAX4. The nucleotide and protein sequence homologies between mouse PAX4 and its human homologue were 83.1% and 80.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the ARP5 (ADP-ribosylation factor 5) gene was also found in the same cosmid g1572c264, suggesting the ARP5 gene to be adjacent to the human PAX4 homologue. The human cosmid g1572c264 contains at least four SSRPs (simple sequence repeat polymorphism), which could be used for genetic linkage studies of the locus. The results of this study, i.e. isolation of the full-length cDNA sequence of PAX4 and identification of the homologous human gene, will facilitate further functional and genetic studies of the PAX4 gene.

natural	NK	HLA-G expression in melanoma: a way for tumor cells to escape from immunosurveillance. Considering the well established role of nonclassical HLA-G class I molecules in inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell function, the consequence of abnormal HLA-G expression in malignant cells should be the escape of tumors from immunosurveillance. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed HLA-G expression and NK sensitivity in human malignant melanoma cells. Our analysis of three melanoma cell lines and ex vivo biopsy demonstrated that (i) IGR and M74 human melanoma cell lines exhibit a high level of HLA-G transcription with differential HLA-G isoform transcription and protein expression patterns, (ii) a higher level of HLA-G transcription ex vivo is detected in a skin melanoma metastasis biopsy compared with a healthy skin fragment from the same individual, and (iii) HLA-G protein isoforms other than membrane-bound HLA-G1 protect IGR from NK lysis. It thus appears of critical importance to consider the specific role of HLA-G expression in tumors in the design of future cancer immunotherapies.
dna double - strand	DSB	Non-histone chromosomal proteins HMG1 and 2 enhance ligation reaction of DNA double-strand breaks. DNA ligase IV in a complex with XRCC4 is responsible for DNA end-joining in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and V(D)J recombination. We found that non-histone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 enhanced the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA with DNA ligase IV from rat liver nuclear extract. Intra-molecular and inter-molecular ligations of cohesive-ended and blunt-ended DNA were markedly stimulated by HMG1 and 2. Recombinant HMG2-domain A, B, and (A + B) polypeptides were similarly, but non-identically, effective for the stimulation of DSB ligation reaction. Ligation of single-strand breaks (nicks) was only slightly activated by the HMG proteins. The DNA end-binding Ku protein singly or in combination with the catalytic component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as the DNA-PK holoenzyme was ineffective for the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA. Although the stimulatory effect of HMG1 and 2 on ligation of DSB in vitro was not specific to DNA ligase IV, these results suggest that HMG1 and 2 are involved in the final ligation step in DNA end-joining processes of DSB repair and V(D)J recombination.

None	ScUAP1	The eukaryotic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylases. Gene cloning, protein expression, and catalytic mechanism. A search of the yeast data base for a protein homologous to Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase yielded UAP1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. The Candida albicans and human homologs were also cloned by screening a C. albicans genomic library and a human testis cDNA library, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the human UAP1 cDNA was identical to previously reported AGX1. A null mutation of the S. cerevisiae UAP1 (ScUAP1) gene was lethal, and when expressed under the control of ScUAP1 promoter, both C. albicans and Homo sapiens UAP1 (CaUAP1 and HsUAP1) rescued the ScUAP1-deficient S. cerevisiae cells. All the recombinant ScUap1p, CaUap1p, and HsUap1p possessed UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activities in vitro. The yeast Uap1p utilized N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate as the substrate, and together with Agm1p, it produced UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. These results demonstrate that the UAP1 genes indeed specify eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and that phosphomutase reaction precedes uridyltransfer. Sequence comparison with other UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases revealed that amino acid residues, Gly112, Gly114, Thr115, Arg116, Pro122, and Lys123 of ScUap1p are highly conserved in UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases reported to date. Among these amino acids, alanine substitution for Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 severely diminished the activity, suggesting that Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 are possible catalytic residues of the enzyme.
best macular dystrop	BMD	Identification of the gene responsible for Best macular dystrophy. Best macular dystrophy (BMD), also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2; OMIM 153700), is an autosomal dominant form of macular degeneration characterized by an abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium cells. In pursuit of the disease gene, we limited the minimum genetic region by recombination breakpoint analysis and mapped to this region a novel retina-specific gene (VMD2). Genetic mapping data, identification of five independent disease-specific mutations and expression studies provide evidence that mutations within the candidate gene are a cause of BMD. The 3' UTR of the candidate gene contains a region of antisense complementarity to the 3' UTR of the ferritin heavy-chain gene (FTH1), indicating the possibility of antisense interaction between VMD2 and FTH1 transcripts.
rna polymerase	Pol II	BRCA1 protein is linked to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex via RNA helicase A. The breast cancer specific tumour suppressor protein, BRCA1 (refs 1,2), activates transcription when linked with a DNA-binding domain and is a component of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme. We show here that RNA helicase A (RHA) protein links BRCA1 to the holoenzyme complex. The region of BRCA1 which interacts with RHA and, thus, the holoenzyme complex, corresponds to subregions of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (ref. 9). This interaction was shown to occur in yeast nuclei, and expression in human cells of a truncated RHA molecule which retains binding to BRCA1 inhibited transcriptional activation mediated by the BRCA1 carboxy terminus. These data are the first to identify a specific protein interaction with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain and are consistent with the model that BRCA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator.

rod monochrom	RM	Total colourblindness is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel. Total colourblindness (OMIM 216900), also referred to as rod monochromacy (RM) or complete achromatopsia, is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and congenital disorder characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus and the complete inability to discriminate between colours. Electroretinographic recordings show that in RM, rod photoreceptor function is normal, whereas cone photoreceptor responses are absent. The locus for RM has been mapped to chromosome 2q11 (ref. 2), however the gene underlying RM has not yet been identified. Recently, a suitable candidate gene, CNGA3, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel, a key component of the phototransduction pathway, has been cloned and assigned to human chromosome 2q11 (refs 3,4). We report the identification of missense mutations in CNGA3 in five families with RM. Homozygous mutations are present in two families, whereas the remaining families show compound heterozygous mutations. In all cases, the segregation pattern of the mutations is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease and all mutations affect amino acids that are highly conserved among cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNG) in various species. This is the first report of a colour vision disorder caused by defects other than mutations in the cone pigment genes, and implies at least in this instance a common genetic basis for phototransduction in the three different cone photoreceptors of the human retina.

granulocy	G-	The IFN-inducible nucleoprotein IFI 16 is expressed in cells of the monocyte lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor populations. IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- (polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not. The strongest expression of IFI 16 was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.

The strongest expression of IFI 16 was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.
colony - stimulating	CSF	The IFN-inducible nucleoprotein IFI 16 is expressed in cells of the monocyte lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor populations. IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- (polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not.

This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.
arbitrarily primed - pc	AP-PCR	A novel candidate oncogene, MCT-1, is involved in cell cycle progression. Using the arbitrarily primed-PCR (AP-PCR) assay to detect genetic abnormalities that occur in a panel of lymphoid cell lines, we identified an amplified stretch of genomic DNA that contained a putative open reading frame. Northern blot analysis with this genomic clone revealed widespread low level expression in normal human tissue. The full cDNA sequence was obtained with no significant homology to any known genes in the genome database. We termed this novel gene with multiple copies in a T-cell malignancy as MCT-1. MCT-1 was localized to the long arm of chromosome Xq22-24 by flourescence in situ hybridization analysis. Although there was no significant homology at the primary sequence level, there was a limited degree of amino acid homology with a domain of cyclin H that appears to specify protein-protein complexes. This relationship between MCT-1 and cyclin H implied a potential role for MCT-1 in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of MCT-1 increased the proliferative rate of cells by decreasing the length of the G1 phase without a reciprocal increase in the S and G2-M phases. Recent work has established the role of cell cycle regulatory molecules in the development of certain human malignancies. Therefore, we investigated the transforming ability of MCT-1 overexpression using soft agar growth assays and demonstrated that only MCT-1-overexpressing cells were able to establish colonies. Taken together, MCT-1 is a novel candidate oncogene with homology to a protein-protein binding domain of cyclin H.
aldo - keto reduc	AKR	Identification of a principal mRNA species for human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform (AKR1C3) that exhibits high prostaglandin D2 11-ketoreductase activity. Human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase exists in four isoforms, which belong to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and are named AKR1C1-AKR1C4. The properties of AKR1C3 have not been fully characterized compared to the other isoforms. In addition, a cDNA that shows more than 99% homology with AKR1C3 cDNA has been cloned from human myeloblasts. We have here expressed and purified a recombinant enzyme (designated as DBDH) from this cDNA. DBDH oxidized xenobiotic alicyclic alcohols and 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxy-5beta-androstanes, and catalyzed the reversible conversion between prostaglandin D2 and 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2 more efficiently than that of 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxysteroids:the respective Km values were 0.6 and 6.8 microM, and kcat/Km values were about 1,000 min-1.mM-1. Anti-inflammatory drugs highly inhibited the enzyme. The recombinant AKR1C3 prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of DBDH also showed the same properties as the wild-type DBDH. Analyses of expression of mRNAs for DBDH and AKR1C3 by reverse transcription-PCR indicated that only one mRNA species for DBDH is expressed in 33 human specimens of liver, kidney, lung, brain, heart, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine, placenta, prostate, and testis. These results suggest that AKR1C3 acts as prostaglandin D2 11-ketoreductase, and that its principal gene in the human has a coding region represented by DBDH cDNA.
all - trans - retinoic	ATRA	Identification of a retinoic acid responsive aldoketoreductase expressed in HL60 leukaemic cells. Neutrophil and monocyte differentiation can be induced in HL60 leukaemia cells by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), respectively, whose differentiating effects can be enhanced by exposure to 'anti-inflammatory agents' and steroids. We have provided evidence that this potentiation is via inhibition of the activity of an enzyme of the aldoketoreductase (AKR) family, but had failed to identify expression of known AKRs in HL60 cells. In this study, we have identified a previously unclassified aldoketoreductase family member (termed HAKR e) that is expressed in HL60 cells. HAKR e is dramatically and transiently up-regulated in HL60 cells within 24 h of exposure to ATRA, further supporting the proposition that a member(s) of this family of enzymes play(s) a role in controlling cell growth and/or differentiation.

transcriptional intermediary factor	TIF1	TIF1gamma, a novel member of the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 family. We report the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 (TIF1) gene family, human TIF1gamma. Similar to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, the structure of TIF1beta is characterized by multiple domains: RING finger, B boxes, Coiled coil, PHD/TTC, and bromodomain. Although structurally related to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, TIF1gamma presents several functional differences. In contrast to TIF1alpha, but like TIF1beta, TIF1 does not interact with nuclear receptors in yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assays and does not interfere with retinoic acid response in transfected mammalian cells. Whereas TIF1alpha and TIF1beta were previously found to interact with the KRAB silencing domain of KOX1 and with the HP1alpha, MODI (HP1beta) and MOD2 (HP1gamma) heterochromatinic proteins, suggesting that they may participate in a complex involved in heterochromatin-induced gene repression, TIF1gamma does not interact with either the KRAB domain of KOX1 or the HP1 proteins. Nevertheless, TIF1gamma, like TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, exhibits a strong silencing activity when tethered to a promoter. Since deletion of a novel motif unique to the three TIF1 proteins, called TIF1 signature sequence (TSS), abrogates transcriptional repression by TIF1gamma, this motif likely participates in TIF1 dependent repression.

signal	SA	Selection of cDNAs encoding putative type II membrane proteins on the cell surface from a human full-length cDNA bank. We have developed a simple method to test whether a hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus of a protein functions as a type II signal anchor (SA) in which the N-terminus faces the cytoplasm. A cDNA fragment containing the putative SA sequence of a target clone was fused in-frame to the 5' end of a cDNA fragment encoding the protease domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). The resulting fused gene was expressed in COS7 cells. Fibrinolytic activity on the cell surface was measured by placing a fibrin sheet in contact with the transfected COS7 cells after removing the medium. When the cDNA fragment encoded a SA, the fibrin sheet was lysed by the u-PA expressed on the cell surface. The fibrinolytic activity was not detected in the culture medium, suggesting that the u-PA remains on the cell surface anchored via the SA in the membrane without being cleaved by signal peptidase. This fibrin sheet method was successfully applied to select five novel cDNA clones encoding putative type II membrane proteins from a human full-length cDNA bank.

mannose - binding lect	MBL	C1qRP is a heavily O-glycosylated cell surface protein involved in the regulation of phagocytic activity. C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) interact with human monocytes and macrophages, resulting in the enhancement of phagocytosis of suboptimally opsonized targets. mAbs that recognize a cell surface molecule of 126,000 Mr, designated C1qRP, have been shown to inhibit C1q- and MBL-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. Similar inhibition of the SPA-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by these mAbs now suggests that C1qRP is a common component of a receptor for these macromolecules. Ligation of human monocytes with immobilized R3, a IgM mAb recognizing C1qRP, also triggers enhanced phagocytic capacity of these cells in the absence of ligand, verifying the direct involvement of this polypeptide in the regulation of phagocytosis. While the cDNA for C1qRP encodes a 631 amino acid membrane protein, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA of the C1qRP coding region express a surface glycoprotein with the identical 126,000 Mr in SDS-PAGE as the native C1qRP. Use of glycosylation inhibitors, cleavage of the mature C1qRP with specific glycosidases, and in vitro translation of C1qRP cDNA demonstrated that both posttranslational glycosylation and the nature of the amino acid sequence of the protein contribute to the difference between its predicted m.w. and its migration on SDS-PAGE. These results verify that the cDNA cloned codes for the mature C1qRP, that C1qRP contains a relatively high degree of O-linked glycoslyation, and that C1qRP cross-linked directly by monoclonal anti-C1qRP or engaged as a result of cell surface ligation of SPA, as well as C1q and MBL, enhances phagocytosis.

	Robo	Slit2-Mediated chemorepulsion and collapse of developing forebrain axons. Diffusible chemorepellents play a major role in guiding developing axons toward their correct targets by preventing them from entering or steering them away from certain regions. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed a novel repulsive guidance system that prevents inappropriate axons from crossing the CNS midline; this repulsive system is mediated by the Roundabout (Robo) receptor and its secreted ligand Slit. In rodents, Robo and Slit are expressed in the spinal cord and Slit can repel spinal motor axons in vitro. Here, we extend these findings into higher brain centers by showing that Robo1 and Robo2, as well as Slit1 and Slit2, are often expressed in complementary patterns in the developing forebrain. Furthermore, we show that human Slit2 can repel olfactory and hippocampal axons and collapse their growth cones.
vitamin d	VDR	Ligand-dependent transcription activation by nuclear receptors requires the DRIP complex. Nuclear receptors modulate the transcription of genes in direct response to small lipophilic ligands. Binding to ligands induces conformational changes in the nuclear receptors that enable the receptors to interact with several types of cofactor that are critical for transcription activation (transactivation). We previously described a distinct set of ligand-dependent proteins called DRIPs, which interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR); together, these proteins constitute a new cofactor complex. DRIPs bind to several nuclear receptors and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement of transcription by VDR and the thyroid-hormone receptor in cell-free transcription assays. Here we report the identities of thirteen DRIPs that constitute this complex, and show that the complex has a central function in hormone-dependent transactivation by VDR on chromatin templates. The DRIPs are almost indistinguishable from components of another new cofactor complex called ARC, which is recruited by other types of transcription activators to mediate transactivation on chromatin-assembled templates. Several DRIP/ARC subunits are also components of other potentially related cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT, SMCC and the mouse Mediator, indicating that unique classes of activators may share common sets or subsets of cofactors. The role of nuclear-receptor ligands may, in part, be to recruit such a cofactor complex to the receptor and, in doing so, to enhance transcription of target genes.
activator - recruited cofa	ARC	Composite co-activator ARC mediates chromatin-directed transcriptional activation. Gene activation in eukaryotes is regulated by complex mechanisms in which the recruitment and assembly of the transcriptional machinery is directed by gene- and cell-type-specific DNA-binding proteins. When DNA is packaged into chromatin, the regulation of gene activation requires new classes of chromatin-targeting activity. In humans, a multisubunit cofactor functions in a chromatin-selective manner to potentiate synergistic gene activation by the transcriptional activators SREBP-1a and Sp1. Here we show that this activator-recruited cofactor (ARC) interacts directly with several different activators, including SREBP-1a, VP16 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, and strongly enhances transcription directed by these activators in vitro with chromatin-assembled DNA templates. The ARC complex consists of 16 or more subunits; some of these are novel gene products, whereas others are present in other multisubunit cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT and mammalian Mediator. Detailed analysis indicates that the ARC complex is probably identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor cofactor DRIP. Thus, ARC/DRIP is a large composite co-activator that belongs to a family of related cofactors and is targeted by different classes of activator to mediate transcriptional stimulation.
immunoglobu	Ig	Myotilin, a novel sarcomeric protein with two Ig-like domains, is encoded by a candidate gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin, a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and [alpha]-actinin, an actin cross-linking protein. Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, the disease genes underlying several disease forms remain to be identified. Here we describe a novel 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein, myotilin. Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains two Ig-like domains homologous to titin. Myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, it co-localizes with [alpha]-actinin in the sarcomeric I--bands and directly interacts with [alpha]-actinin. The human myotilin gene maps to chromosome 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500. The locus of a dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1A) resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a new type of distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (VCPMD) has been mapped to the same locus. The muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raise the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause muscular dystrophy.
wolf - hirschhorn	WHS	Comparative analysis of a novel gene from the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome critical region. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by mental and developmental defects resulting from the absence of a segment of one chromosome 4 short arm (4p16.3). Recently, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS), which is also due to a deletion of chromosome 4p16.3, has been shown to be allelic to WHS. Due to the complex and variable expression of these disorders, it is thought that WHS/PRDS results from a segmental aneusomy of 4p resulting in haploinsufficieny of an undefined number of genes that contribute to the phenotype. In an effort to identify genes that contribute to human development and whose absence may contribute to the phenotype associated with these syndromes, we have generated a transcript map of the 165-kb critical region and have identified a number of potential genes. One of these genes, WHSC2, which was identified with the IMAGE cDNA clone 53283, has been characterized. Sequence analysis defined an open reading frame of 1584 bp (528 amino acids), and transcript analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In parallel, the mouse homologue was isolated and characterized. Mouse sequence analysis and the pattern of expression are consistent with the clone being the murine equivalent of the human WHSC2 gene (designated Whsc2h). The data from sequence and transcript analysis of this new human gene in combination with the lack of significant similarity to proteins of known function imply that it represents a novel gene. Most importantly, its location within the WHSCR suggests that this gene may play a role in the phenotype of the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome.

None	PKC	Rab6 is phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism: effects on GTP/GDP binding and cellular distribution. In platelets and other secretory cells, protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in exocytosis stimulated by physiological extracellular signals, although its linkage to the secretory machinery is poorly understood. We investigated whether Rab6, a GTP-binding protein that fractionates with platelet alpha-granules, may be involved in linking these processes. We found that Rab6 contains two PKC consensus phosphorylation sites that are evolutionarily conserved. In platelets metabolically labelled with [(32)P]P(i), Rab6 phosphorylation was induced by phorbol esters or by thrombin. This phosphorylation was blocked by a specific PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8220), but not by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (PD-169316). Physiological stimulation of platelets caused a PKC-dependent translocation of Rab6 from platelet particulate fractions, nearly doubling the fraction of Rab6 in the cytosol. A human Rab6 isoform (Rab6C) that is preferentially expressed in human platelet RNA was cloned and its phosphorylation by PKC was characterized. Rab6C incorporated up to 2 mol of [(32)P]P(i) per mol of active protein. Rab6C bound GDP and GTP with K(d) values of 113+/-12 and 119+/-27 nM respectively, and hydrolysed GTP at a rate of 100+/-15 micromol of GTP/mol of Rab6C per min. PKC phosphorylation of Rab6C increased the affinity for GTP by 3-fold, although it had lesser effects on GDP (1.6-fold). Phosphorylation did not alter the GTPase activity. In summary, thrombin activation of platelets leads to PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Rab6 and a translocation of Rab6 to the cytosol. We suggest that PKC phosphorylation may be an important mechanism through which Rab functional interactions in vesicle trafficking and secretion can be altered in response to an external stimulus.
thioredoxin reduc	TR	Redox regulation of cell signaling by selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductases. The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, together with the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is thought to participate in redox signaling in mammalian cells. The activity of thioredoxin is dependent on the redox status of thioredoxin reductase (TR), the activity of which in turn is dependent on a selenocysteine residue. Two mammalian TR isozymes (TR2 and TR3), in addition to that previously characterized (TR1), have now been identified in humans and mice. All three TR isozymes contain a selenocysteine residue that is located in the penultimate position at the carboxyl terminus and which is encoded by a UGA codon. The generation of reactive oxygen species in a human carcinoma cell line was shown to result in both the oxidation of the selenocysteine in TR1 and a subsequent increase in the expression of this enzyme. These observations identify the carboxyl-terminal selenocysteine of TR1 as a cellular redox sensor and support an essential role for mammalian TR isozymes in redox-regulated cell signaling.
bone morphogenetic	BMP	A SMAD ubiquitin ligase targets the BMP pathway and affects embryonic pattern formation. The TGF-beta superfamily of proteins regulates many different biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and embryonic pattern formation. TGF-beta-like factors signal across cell membranes through complexes of transmembrane receptors known as type I and type II serine/threonine-kinase receptors, which in turn activate the SMAD signalling pathway. On the inside of the cell membrane, a receptor-regulated class of SMADs are phosphorylated by the type-I-receptor kinase. In this way, receptors for different factors are able to pass on specific signals along the pathway: for example, receptors for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target SMADs 1, 5 and 8, whereas receptors for activin and TGF-beta target SMADs 2 and 3. Phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMADs induces their association with Smad4, the 'common-partner' SMAD, and stimulates accumulation of this complex in the nucleus, where it regulates transcriptional responses. Here we describe Smurf1, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated SMADs specific for the BMP pathway in order to trigger their ubiquitination and degradation, and hence their inactivation. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, Smurf1 messenger RNA is localized to the animal pole of the egg; in Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf1 inhibits the transmission of BMP signals and thereby affects pattern formation. Smurf1 also enhances cellular responsiveness to the Smad2 (activin/TGF-beta) pathway. Thus, targeted ubiquitination of SMADs may serve to control both embryonic development and a wide variety of cellular responses to TGF-beta signals.
hepatocyte nuclear	HNF	Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6: associations between genetic variability and type II diabetes and between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the HNF-6 gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects. METHODS: We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY probands without mutations in the MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies. RESULTS: We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.

dna double - strand	DSBs	Cloning, characterization, and localization of mouse and human SPO11. Spo11 is a meiosis-specific protein in yeast that has been found covalently bound to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the early stages of meiosis. These DSBs initiate homologous recombination, which is required for proper segregation of chromosomes and the generation of genetic diversity during meiosis. Here we report the cloning, characterization, tissue expression, and chromosomal localization of both mouse and human homologues of Spo11. The putative mouse and human proteins are 82% identical and share approximately 25% identity with other family members. Northern blot analysis revealed testis-specific expression for both genes, but RT-PCR results showed ubiquitous expression of at least a portion of Spo11 in mouse. Human SPO11 was also detected in several somatic tissues. Mouse Spo11 was localized to chromosome 2H4, and human SPO11 was localized to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3, a region amplified in some breast and ovarian tumors.
loss of heterozygos	LOH	Characterization of copine VII, a new member of the copine family, and its exclusion as a candidate in sporadic breast cancers with loss of heterozygosity at 16q24.3. In a search for candidate tumor suppressor genes within a 650-kb common region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16q24.3 in breast cancer tissues, a 2.6-kb cDNA, named copine VII (CPNE7), was characterized. The gene is 2654 bp and codes for a 633-residue protein with high homology to the other members of the copine family, such as copine I, copine III, and N-copine. The predicted amino acid sequence contains two copies of a C2 domain in the N-terminus. Since these domains have been found in several membrane-binding proteins involved in different intracellular processes, copine VII was viewed as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Mutation analysis was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of 18 breast tumor tissue samples with ascertained LOH on chromosome 16q24.3. Since only two polymorphisms were identified, no evidence was found to indicate that copine VII is the tumor suppressor gene at 16q24.3 involved in breast cancer.
None	SGK	Characterization of the structure and regulation of two novel isoforms of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase. The catalytic domain of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) is 54% identical with protein kinase B (PKB) and, like PKB, is activated in vitro by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and in vivo in response to signals that activate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Here we identify two novel isoforms of SGK, termed SGK2 and SGK3, whose catalytic domains share 80% amino acid sequence identity with each other and with SGK (renamed SGK1). Like SGK1, the mRNA encoding SGK3 is expressed in all tissues examined, but SGK2 mRNA is only present at significant levels in liver, kidney and pancreas and, at lower levels, in the brain. The levels of SGK2 mRNA in H4IIE cells and SGK3 mRNA in Rat2 fibroblasts are not increased by stimulation with serum or dexamethasone, whereas the level of SGK1 mRNA is increased greatly. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated in vitro by PDK1, albeit more slowly than SGK1, and their activation is accompanied by the phosphorylation of Thr(193) and Thr(253) respectively, the residues equivalent to the Thr in the 'activation loop' of PKB that is targeted by PDK1. The PDK1-catalysed phosphorylation and activation of SGK2 and SGK3, like SGK1, is greatly potentiated by mutating Ser(356) and Ser(419) respectively to Asp, these residues being equivalent to the C-terminal phosphorylation site of PKB. Like SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 are activated 5-fold via a phosphorylation mechanism when cells are exposed to H(2)O(2) but, in contrast with SGK1, activation is only suppressed partially by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated to a smaller extent by insulin-like growth factor-1 (2-fold) than SGK1 (5-fold). Like PKB and SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 preferentially phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues that lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr motifs.

src homology	SH2	Lad, an adapter protein interacting with the SH2 domain of p56lck, is required for T cell activation. T cell-specific Src family tyrosine kinase, p56lck, plays crucial roles in T cell differentiation, activation, and proliferation. These multiple functions of p56lck are believed to be conducted through the protein-protein interactions with various cellular signaling proteins. To clarify the mechanisms through which p56lck contributes to T cell signaling, we identified the proteins binding to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of p56lck through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent yeast two-hybrid screening. Subsequent characterization of positive clones revealed the presence of a protein of 366 aa named Lad (Lck-associated adapter protein), which is a potential murine homologue of previously reported TSAd, a T cell-specific adapter protein. Lad contains several protein-protein interaction domains including a zinc-finger motif, an SH2 domain, a proline-rich SH3 binding motif, and several phosphotyrosine sites. Furthermore, Lad was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with p56lck in vivo and redistributed from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in a T cell activation-dependent manner. Moreover in T cells, IL-2 promoter activity was enhanced upon coexpression of Lad but was inhibited by the coexpression of antisense Lad RNA. These characteristics of Lad suggest that Lad play an essential role as an adapter protein in p56lck-mediated T cell signaling.

oxysterol binding	OSBP	Family of human oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) homologues. A novel member implicated in brain sterol metabolism. Oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) is a cytosolic protein that undergoes ligand-induced binding to the Golgi apparatus and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae an OSBP homologue is involved in membrane trafficking through the Golgi complex. Prompted by the multitude of OSBP-related genes in the yeast genome, we carried out a search for human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) displaying homology to the sterol-binding domain of OSBP. This revealed a minimum of six novel OSBP-related proteins, designated ORP-1 to ORP-6. ORP cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human liver mRNA, and used for Northern blot analysis of human tissue transcript panels. This verified that each of them represents a different gene product and showed that they display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The ORP-1 and -2 mRNA expression levels were similar to or higher than that of OSBP while the ORP-3 to -6 mRNAs were detected at lower levels in specific tissues. The most abundantly expressed new gene, ORP-1, was transcribed at strikingly high levels in the cortical areas of human brain and displayed sterol-regulated expression in a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line. This indicates that ORP-1 may play an important role in maintaining the sterol balance in cells of the central nervous system. Together with OSBP, the identified gene products constitute a novel human protein family that may provide a link between organellar sterol status and membrane dynamics.

limb girdle muscular dystrop	LGMD	Myoferlin, a candidate gene and potential modifier of muscular dystrophy. Dysferlin, the gene product of the limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B locus, encodes a membrane-associated protein with homology to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. Humans with mutations in dysferlin ( DYSF ) develop muscle weakness that affects both proximal and distal muscles. Strikingly, the phenotype in LGMD 2B patients is highly variable, but the type of mutation in DYSF cannot explain this phenotypic variability. Through electronic database searching, we identified a protein highly homologous to dysferlin that we have named myoferlin. Myoferlin mRNA was highly expressed in cardiac muscle and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle. However, antibodies raised to myoferlin showed abundant expression of myoferlin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Within the cell, myoferlin was associated with the plasma membrane but, unlike dysferlin, myoferlin was also associated with the nuclear membrane. Ferlin family members contain C2 domains, and these domains play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events. To investigate this, we studied the expression of myoferlin in the mdx mouse, which lacks dystrophin and whose muscles undergo repeated rounds of degeneration and regeneration. We found upregulation of myoferlin at the membrane in mdx skeletal muscle. Thus, myoferlin ( MYOF ) is a candidate gene for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, or possibly a modifier of the muscular dystrophy phenotype.

novel ca ( 2 + ) - binding	CABP	Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein (CABP) subfamily with similarity to calmodulin. Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein subfamily (CaBP), with 46-58% sequence similarity to calmodulin (CaM), were identified in the vertebrate retina. Important differences between these Ca(2+)-binding proteins and CaM include alterations within their second EF-hand loop that render these motifs inactive in Ca(2+) coordination and the fact that their central alpha-helixes are extended by one alpha-helical turn. CaBP1 and CaBP2 contain a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation, similar to members of the recoverin subfamily and are fatty acid acylated in vitro. The patterns of expression differ for each of the various members. Expression of CaBP5, for example, is restricted to retinal rod and cone bipolar cells. In contrast, CaBP1 has a more widespread pattern of expression. In the brain, CaBP1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the retina this protein is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells. CaBP1 and CaBP2 are expressed as multiple, alternatively spliced variants, and in heterologous expression systems these forms show different patterns of subcellular localization. In reconstitution assays, CaBPs are able to substitute functionally for CaM. These data suggest that these novel CaBPs are an important component of Ca(2+)-mediated cellular signal transduction in the central nervous system where they may augment or substitute for CaM.

matrix metalloprotein	MMP	Leukolysin/MMP25/MT6-MMP: a novel matrix metalloproteinase specifically expressed in the leukocyte lineage. A novel matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was identified from leukocytes and found to be specifically expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes among 29 different tissues examined. Named leukolysin, it encodes for 562 residues with a conserved MMP structure, i.e., pre-, pro-, catalytic, hinge- and hemopexin-like domains, but also a RXK/RR motif, known for its role in MMP zymogen activation, and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment. Overall, leukolysin displays the strongest homology to the newly identified MT-MMP subgroup with 45% and 39% identities to MT4- and MT1-MMPs vs 30% and 31.5% to MMP1 and 3 respectively. Unlike MT4-MMP whose proteolytic activity remains undefined, a C-terminally truncated leukolysin is expressed as a strong gelatinolytic species at 28 kDa which is derived from a cell-associated 34 kDa proenzyme, presumably by furin or proprotein convertase mediated removal of the propeptide (approximately 6 kDa). By green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging, the intracellular proenzyme is localized to granules throughout the cell, suggesting that activation occur immediately prior to secretion. Taken together, leukolysin may be part of the proteolytic arsenal deployed by leukocytes during inflammatory responses. Molecular cloning of a novel MMP: MMP:25

peroxisomal membrane	PMPs	PEX19 binds multiple peroxisomal membrane proteins, is predominantly cytoplasmic, and is required for peroxisome membrane synthesis. Peroxisomes are components of virtually all eukaryotic cells. While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.

The localization of proteolytic enzymes at the cell surface is a widely used strategy for facilitating tumor invasion. In this study, we have cloned a new member of the membrane-type subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), a group of enzymes associated with tumor progression. The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 562 amino acids with a domain organization similar to that of other MT-MMPs, including a prodomain with a cysteine switch, a catalytic domain with the zinc-binding site, a hemopexin-like domain, and a COOH-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues. The predicted protein sequence also contains a short insertion of basic residues located between the propeptide and the catalytic domain and involved in the proteolytic activation of MT-MMPs by furin-like enzymes. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA revealed that the encoded protein is localized at the cell surface. Based on these properties, this novel human matrix metalloproteinase has been called MT6-MMP because it is the sixth identified member of this subfamily of matrix metalloproteinase. Cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding MT6-MMP and progelatinase A resulted in activation of COS-7-secreted progelatinase A, as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transfection of progelatinase A cDNA alone did not lead to the activation of the proenzyme. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from human tissues demonstrated that MT6-MMP is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, lung, and spleen. MT6-MMP was also detected at high levels in SW480 colon carcinoma cells as well as in some anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, but not in normal colon or brain or in meningiomas. On the basis of these results, we propose that MT6-MMP may facilitate tumor progression through its ability to activate progelatinase A at the membrane of cells from colon carcinomas or brain tumors.
protocadherin	Pcdh12	Large exons encoding multiple ectodomains are a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes. Recent studies revealed a striking difference in the genomic organization of classic cadherin genes and one family of " nonclassic cadherin " genes designated protocadherins. Specifically, the DNA sequences encoding the ectodomain repeats of classic cadherins are interrupted by multiple introns. By contrast, all of the encoded ectodomains of each member of the protocadherin gene clusters are present in one large exon. To determine whether large ectodomain exons are a general feature of protocadherin genes we have investigated the genomic organization of several additional human protocadherin genes by using DNA sequence information in GenBank. These genes include protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12), an ortholog of the mouse vascular endothelial cadherin-2 gene; hFmi1 and hFmi2, homologs of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene, flamingo; hFat2, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene fat; and the Drosophila DN-cadherin and DE-cadherin genes. Each of these genes was found to be a member of the protocadherin subfamily, based on amino acid sequence comparisons of their ectodomains. Remarkably, all of these protocadherin genes share a common feature: most of the genomic DNA sequences encoding their ectodomains are not interrupted by an intron. We conclude that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.
atp binding	ABC	Characterization of ABCB9, an ATP binding cassette protein associated with lysosomes. We have cloned full-length human and mouse cDNAs of ABCB9, which encodes a predicted multiple-spanning transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain with Walker motifs. It is therefore designated as a " half " ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Northern analysis shows that the ABCB9 mRNA is expressed at a high level in testes and moderate levels in brain and spinal cord. A splice variant mRNA deleted in the last pair of predicted transmembrane segments was shown to be expressed in human tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ABCB9 is closely related to TAP1 and TAP2, two " half " ABC proteins found in endoplasmic reticulum. ABCB9 protein colocalized with the lysosomal markers, LAMP1 and LAMP2, in transfected cells. ABCB9 protein appears to be most highly expressed in the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules in mouse and rat testes. These cells have high levels of phagocytosis and secretory activities. These findings pave the way for further investigation into the potential novel function of ABCB9 in lysosomes.
lipoprotein receptor - related protein - deleted in	LRP-DIT	LRP-DIT, a putative endocytic receptor gene, is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. A variety of studies suggest that allelic losses at chromosome 2q are associated with aggressive behavior of various forms of human neoplasia. Using a probe to detect homozygous deletions on chromosome 2q21.2 in kidney and bladder cancer cell lines, we identified a new candidate tumor suppressor gene, lipoprotein receptor-related protein-deleted in tumors (LRP-DIT). The predicted LRP-DIT product of 4599 amino acids has extensive homology to a gigantic receptor, LRP1, which mediates endocytosis of multiple proteins from the cell surface. Homozygous deletions in LRP-DIT were detected in 17% (4 of 23) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The expression of only abnormal transcripts missing portions of the LRP-DIT sequence was demonstrated in an additional 30% (11 of 36) of NSCLC lines. Finally, a missense mutation at codon 3157 was detected in one of four NSCLC lines tested for the large open reading frame. In contrast, no LRP-DIT alterations were identified in a major fraction of SCLC cell lines, indicating that this gene is preferentially inactivated in one histological type of lung cancer. Our data suggest that inactivation of LRP-DIT occurs in at least 40% of NSCLC lines and thus may play an important role in tumorigenesis of NSCLCs.

cdna expressed sequence	EST	Cloning of CCRL1, an orphan seven transmembrane receptor related to chemokine receptors, expressed abundantly in the heart. In an attempt to identify novel chemokine receptor genes, cDNA expressed sequence tags (EST) were analyzed for a significant homology with mammalian chemokine receptors. The sequence from one of the selected EST clones was used to generate a full-length cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane receptor, CCRL1-CC chemokine receptor like 1. The full-length receptor encodes a polypeptide of 350 amino acids and has about 35% homology to the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR7. Northern blot analysis indicates predominant expression of about 5.0, 2.0 and 1.3kb mRNA forms in human heart tissue, while low-level expression of the 2.0 and 1.3kb forms was observed in lung, pancreas and spleen and in fetal tissues. In-situ hybridization confirmed the presence of CCRL1 mRNA in cardiac muscle cells. Similar to the chemokine receptor CCR6, CCRL1 maps to chromosome 6 and has one intron in the 5' untranslated region. Coupled transcription-translation of CCRL1 cDNA yielded a glycosylated polypeptide of about 45kDa.
human organic anion transporting polypeptide	OATP2	Localization and genomic organization of a new hepatocellular organic anion transporting polypeptide. Based on sequence homology to the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2; SLC21A6), we cloned a new member of the SLC21A superfamily of solute carriers, termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). The protein of 702 amino acids showed an amino acid identity of 80% with human OATP2. Based on Northern blotting, the expression of OATP8 was restricted to human liver. Cosmid clones containing the genes encoding human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) served to establish their genomic organization. All three genes contained 14 exons with 13 identical splice sites when transferred to the amino acid sequence. An antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus localized OATP8 to the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and the recombinant glycoprotein, expressed in MDCKII cells, to the lateral membrane. Transport properties of OATP8 were studied in stably transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells. Organic anions transported by human OATP8 included sulfobromophthalein, with a K(m) of 3.3 microm, and 17beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, with a K(m) of 5.4 microm. Several bile salts were not substrates. Thus, human OATP8 is a new uptake transporter in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane with an overlapping but distinct substrate specificity as compared with OATP2, which is localized to the same membrane domain.
None	DD	AAC-11 overexpression induces invasion and protects cervical cancer cells from apoptosis. To identify the genes involved in cervical carcinogenesis, we applied the mRNA differential display (DD) method to analyze normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer, metastatic lymph node, and cervical cancer cell line. We cloned a 491-bp cDNA fragment, CC231, which was present in metastatic tissue and cervical cancer cell line, but absent in normal cervical and cervical cancer tissues. The 491 bp cDNA fragment has 98% homology to the previously published sequence, AAC-11 (antiapoptosis clone 11). The levels of AAC-11 mRNA expressions in nine normal cervical and nine primary cervical cancer tissues were low. Its expression was higher in three metastatic tissues and five cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki, SiHa, CUMC-3, and CUMC-6). Invasion of matrigel and adhesion to laminin by AAC-11 transfected CUMC-6 cells were increased by approximately 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) genes were found to be expressed in high levels in AAC-11-transfected cancer cells. But MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were not expressed in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells. AAC-11-transfected cells expressed an elevated level of MMP-2 protein as assessed by immunoblotting. On the contrary, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-2) expression was detectable in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells, respectively. Its expression was undetectable in AAC-11 transfected cells. In cervical cancer cells transfected with AAC-11, the expression of beta-catenin was up-regulated. These suggest that overexpressions of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, loss of TIMP-2 expression, and up-regulation of beta-catenin by AAC-11 transfection may contribute to the development of cervical cancer invasion. AAC-11 gene transfection increased cervical cancer cell colonization. The effect of AAC-11 on cultured cervical cancer cells was associated with antiapoptotic process. Approximately 50% of the AAC-11 transfected cells in serum-free medium died after 2 weeks, compared to 1 week for vector alone or wild-type cells. These results suggest that AAC-11 may serve as a candidate metastasis-related and apoptosis-inhibiting gene in human cervical cancer.

tubulointerstitial nephritis	TIN-ag	Cloning, characterization, and expression of the human TIN-ag-RP gene encoding a novel putative extracellular matrix protein. The human gene encoding a novel tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag)-related protein (TIN-ag-RP) was isolated, and its genomic organization was determined. BLAST searches revealed the highest degree of homology to several mammalian TIN-ag orthologues, and a weak homology to cathepsin B-like proteases. The 12 kb gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 1p34.2-3, a locus neither related to that of the human TIN-ag (6p11.2-12) nor to that of cathepsin B (8p22-23.1). The TIN-ag-RP is encoded in ten exons with introns ranging from 83 bp to 4 kb. In addition, the gene contained one exon in the 5'UTR, but none in the 3'UTR. Five of the 10 splice sites of the TIN-ag-RP gene were fully conserved when compared to a related gene of C. elegans, whereas only one splice site was identical to those found in cathepsin B genes. Furthermore, human TIN-ag-RP tagged with the T7-epitope, was expressed in HeLa cells, and was found to be localized in vesicular compartments as well as secreted into the medium suggesting the involvement of the endosomal trafficking pathway. Based on the high degree of homology of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization between TIN-ag-RP and TIN-ag, we suggest that both molecules may form a distinct group or family of TIN-ag-like proteins.

tel1 / etv	TEL1	Identification and characterization of a new human ETS-family transcription factor, TEL2, that is expressed in hematopoietic tissues and can associate with TEL1/ETV6. The ETS family of proteins is a large group of transcription factors implicated in many aspects of normal hematopoietic development, as well as oncogenesis. For example, the TEL1/ETV6 (TEL1) gene is required for normal yolk sac angiogenesis, adult bone marrow hematopoiesis, and is rearranged or deleted in numerous leukemias. This report describes the cloning and characterization of a novel ETS gene that is highly related to TEL1 and is therefore called TEL2. The TEL2 gene consists of 8 exons spanning approximately 21 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome 6p21. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed TEL1 gene, however, TEL2 appears to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissues. Antibodies raised against the C-terminus of the TEL2 protein were used to show that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. All ETS proteins can bind DNA via the highly conserved ETS domain, which recognizes a purine-rich DNA sequence with a GGAA core motif. DNA binding assays show that TEL2 can bind the same consensus DNA binding sequence recognized by TEL1/ETV6. Additionally, the TEL2 protein is capable of associating with itself and with TEL1 in doubly transfected Hela cells, and this interaction is mediated through the pointed (PNT) domain of TEL1. The striking similarities of TEL2 to the oncogenic TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggest that TEL2 may be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

human ubiquilin	UBQLN3	Molecular cloning, chromosome mapping and characterization of UBQLN3 a testis-specific gene that contains an ubiquitin-like domain. The sequence of the ubiquitin protein is highly conserved between species and has facilitated the cloning of numerous ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present study, we report the cloning of the cDNA for human ubiquilin 3 (UBQLN3). The deduced amino acid sequence of UBQLN3 contains a UBQ domain (ubiquitin-like) in the amino terminus as well as two highly conserved domains found in several recently cloned ubiquitin-like proteins. One of these domains, termed the NP domain, is a highly conserved 93 amino acid region present in UBQLN3 and several ubiquitin-like proteins. The last conserved domain is the UBA domain (ubiquitin-associated) found in a variety of proteins of the ubiquination pathway. The human UBQLN3 gene was mapped to the 11p15 region of chromosome 11. Northern blot analysis of multiple human and mouse tissues demonstrated UBQLN3 mRNA expression specifically in testis.
interleukin -	IL-1	Tollip, a new component of the IL-1RI pathway, links IRAK to the IL-1 receptor. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine that elicits its pleiotropic effects through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. Binding of IL-1 to its receptor results in rapid assembly of a membrane-proximal signalling complex that consists of two different receptor chains (IL-1Rs), IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, the adaptor protein MyD88, the serine/threonine kinase IRAK and a new protein, which we have named Tollip. Here we show that, before IL-1beta treatment, Tollip is present in a complex with IRAK, and that recruitment of Tollip-IRAK complexes to the activated receptor complex occurs through association of Tollip with IL-1RAcP. Co-recruited MyD88 then triggers IRAK autophosphorylation, which in turn leads to rapid dissociation of IRAK from Tollip (and IL-1Rs). As overexpression of Tollip results in impaired NF-kappaB activation, we conclude that Tollip is an important constituent of the IL-1R signalling pathway.
neuropeptide neurokinin	NKB	Excessive placental secretion of neurokinin B during the third trimester causes pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.
pope	POP	Isolation and characterization of the novel popeye gene family expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. We identified a novel gene family in vertebrates which is preferentially expressed in developing and adult striated muscle. Three genes of the Popeye (POP) family were detected in human and mouse and two in chicken. Chromosomal mapping indicates that Pop1 and Pop3 genes are clustered on mouse chromosome 10, whereas Pop2 maps to mouse chromosome 16. We found evidence that POP1 and POP3 in chicken may also be linked and multiple transcript isoforms are generated from this locus. The POP genes encode proteins with three potential transmembrane domains that are conserved in all family members. Individual POP genes exhibit specific expression patterns during development and postnatally. Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The strong conservation of POP genes during evolution and their preferential expression in heart and skeletal muscle suggest that these novel proteins may have an important function in these tissues in vertebrates.
spinocerebellar ataxia type	SCA8	The SCA8 transcript is an antisense RNA to a brain-specific transcript encoding a novel actin-binding protein (KLHL1). Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat that is transcribed as part of an untranslated RNA. As a step towards understanding the molecular pathology of SCA8, we have defined the genomic organization of the SCA8 RNA transcripts and assembled a 166 kb segment of genomic sequence containing the repeat. The most striking feature of the SCA8 transcripts is that the most 5' exon is transcribed through the first exon of another gene that is transcribed in the opposite orientation. This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed.

This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed.
methyl - cpg binding domain	MBDs	DNMT1 binds HDAC2 and a new co-repressor, DMAP1, to form a complex at replication foci. DNA methylation can contribute to transcriptional silencing through several transcriptionally repressive complexes, which include methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show here that the chief enzyme that maintains mammalian DNA methylation, DNMT1, can also establish a repressive transcription complex. The non-catalytic amino terminus of DNMT1 binds to HDAC2 and a new protein, DMAP1 (for DNMT1 associated protein), and can mediate transcriptional repression. DMAP1 has intrinsic transcription repressive activity, and binds to the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101. DMAP1 is targeted to replication foci through interaction with the far N terminus of DNMT1 throughout S phase, whereas HDAC2 joins DNMT1 and DMAP1 only during late S phase, providing a platform for how histones may become deacetylated in heterochromatin following replication. Thus, DNMT1 not only maintains DNA methylation, but also may directly target, in a heritable manner, transcriptionally repressive chromatin to the genome during DNA replication.

fibroblast growth	FGFs	Molecular cloning and characterization of human FGF-20 on chromosome 8p21.3-p22. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play important roles in morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and carcinogenesis. Human FGF-20 has been cloned and characterized in this study. FGF-20 encodes a 211-amino-acid polypeptide with the FGF-core domain. A strong hydrophobic region was found in the FGF-core domain of FGF-20; however, no typical N-terminal signal sequence was found in FGF-20, just as in FGF-9 and FGF-16. Total amino acid identities are as follows: FGF-20 vs FGF-9, 71.6%; FGF-20 vs FGF-16, 66.2%; FGF-9 vs FGF-16, 72.4%. Phylogenic analysis indicated that FGF-20, FGF-9, and FGF-16 constitute a subfamily among the FGF family. FGF-20 mRNA of 2.4 kb in size was detected in colon cancer cell line SW480 by Northern blot analysis. Lower levels of FGF-20 mRNA were detected in human fetal tissues and primary cancers by cDNA-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA is split into three parts in the human genome sequence of the chromosome 8p21.3-p22 region (Accession No. AB020858). These results indicate that the FGF-20 gene, located on human chromosome 8p21.3-p22, consists of three exons. Compared with the nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA determined in this study, one nucleotide deletion and one nucleotide substitution in the putative coding region were identified in human genome sequence AB020858.
expressed sequence	ESTs	Cloning and characterization of cDNA encoding a novel human leukotriene B(4) receptor. By homology screening using BLAST searches of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we have found a previously unidentified cDNA encoding a putative seven-transmembrane receptor with highest similarity to the leukotriene B(4) receptor, BLTR. Analysis of calcium flow in transfected cells, along with sequence analysis, revealed that the EST encoded a functionally inactive protein, lacking the segment corresponding to the C-terminal part of the putative receptor protein. The missing segment was obtained by PCR amplification of a human leukocyte cDNA library and ligated to the truncated EST cDNA. The novel cDNA encodes a full-length receptor with 39% identity to the previously cloned BLTR. Studies of intracellular calcium flow of transfected HeLa cells exposed to various leukotrienes showed that also the novel BLTR-like receptor can be activated by leukotriene B(4), and it is therefore tentatively named BLTR2.
crp2 binding	CRP2BP	The cysteine- and glycine-rich LIM domain protein CRP2 specifically interacts with a novel human protein (CRP2BP). We used the interaction trap to isolate a novel human protein that specifically interacts with the double LIM domain protein CRP2. This protein, designated CRP2BP (for CRP2 binding partner), was previously postulated by sequencing contigs of human chromosome 20. The observed interaction is mediated via the LIM1 domain of CRP2 and is of functional relevance in cellular environment. This novel single copy gene spans approximately 45-bp and is organized into at least ten exons. CRP2BP is expressed in all human tissues tested, with a major mRNA of 4-kb in size and an additional 3.2-kb transcript in placenta.
membrane - associated nucleic acid - binding	MNAB	A human gene coding for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein. Studies to clone a cell-surface DNA-binding protein involved in the binding and internalization of extracellular DNA have led to the isolation of a gene for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (MNAB). The full-length cDNA is 4.3 kilobases with an open reading frame of 3576 base pairs encoding a protein of approximately 130 kDa (GenBank accession numbers and ). The MNAB gene is on human chromosome 9 with wide expression in normal tissues and tumor cells. A C3HC4 RING finger and a CCCH zinc finger have been identified in the amino-terminal half of the protein. MNAB bound DNA (K(D) approximately 4 nm) and mutagenesis of a single conserved amino acid in the zinc finger reduced DNA binding by 50%. A potential transmembrane domain exists near the carboxyl terminus. Antibodies against the amino-terminal half of the protein immunoprecipitated a protein of molecular mass approximately 150 kDa and reacted with cell surfaces. The MNAB protein is membrane-associated and primarily localized to the perinuclear space, probably to the endoplasmic reticulum or trans-Golgi network. Characterization of the MNAB protein as a cell-surface DNA-binding protein, critical in binding and internalization of extracellular DNA, awaits confirmation of its localization to cell surfaces.
xpa - binding protein	XAB2	XAB2, a novel tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and transcription. Nucleotide excision repair is a highly versatile DNA repair system responsible for elimination of a wide variety of lesions from the genome. It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and global genome repair. Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways. The XAB2 protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2 inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts. These results indicate that XAB2 is a novel component involved in transcription-coupled repair and transcription.
activation - induced cytidine deamina	AID	Isolation, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of the human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. The gene encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the cytidine deaminase family, was isolated from a murine B cell lymphoma line, CH12F3-2, induced by combined stimulation of TGF-beta, IL-4, and CD40L. We have isolated the human orthologue of mouse AID cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 198 residues containing a conserved cytidine deaminase motif. The amino acid sequence of human AID is 92% identical to that of mouse AID. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues showed that AID mRNA is expressed strongly in lymph nodes and tonsils. The complete human AID gene consisting of five exons was isolated and mapped to chromosome 12p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

lipopolysaccha	LPS	Human interleukin-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor: molecular cloning and functional characterization as an hepatocyte-stimulating factor. IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor (IL-TIF or IL-21) is a new cytokine structurally related to IL-10 and originally identified in the mouse as a gene induced by IL-9 in T cells and mast cells. Here, we report the cloning of the human IL-TIF cDNA, which shares 79% amino acid identity with mouse IL-TIF and 25% identity with human IL-10. Recombinant human IL-TIF was found to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription factors-1 and -3 in several hepatoma cell lines. IL-TIF stimulation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells up-regulated the production of acute phase reactants such as serum amyloid A, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and haptoglobin. Although IL-10 and IL-TIF have distinct activities, antibodies directed against the beta chain of the IL-10 receptor blocked the induction of acute phase reactants by IL-TIF, indicating that this chain is a common component of the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptors. Similar acute phase reactant induction was observed in mouse liver upon IL-TIF injection, and IL-TIF expression was found to be rapidly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, suggesting that this cytokine contributes to the inflammatory response in vivo.
tc10 -	TCL	Characterization of TCL, a new GTPase of the rho family related to TC10 andCcdc42. GTPases of the Rho family control a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell morphology, motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We report here the characterization of a new Rho member, which shares 85% and 78% amino acid similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, respectively. This GTPase, termed as TC10-like (TCL) is encoded by an unexpectedly large locus, made of five exons spanning over 85 kilobases on human chromosome 14. TCL mRNA is 2.5 kilobases long and is mainly expressed in heart. In vitro, TCL shows rapid GDP/GTP exchange and displays higher GTP dissociation and hydolysis rates than TC10. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays, we show that GTP-bound but not GDP-bound TCL protein directly interacts with Cdc42/Rac interacting binding domains, such as those found in PAK and WASP. Despite its overall similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, the constitutively active TCL mutant displays distinct morphogenic activity in REF-52 fibroblasts, producing large and dynamic F-actin-rich ruffles on the dorsal cell membrane. Interestingly, TCL morphogenic activity is blocked by dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 mutants, suggesting a cross-talk between these three Rho GTPases.
human natural resistance associated macrophage protein	NRAMP1	Complete nucleotide sequence and genomic structure of the human NRAMP1 gene region on chromosome region 2q35. Several lines of independent evidence suggest that human Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 gene (NRAMP1) is an important regulator of susceptibility to infectious diseases caused by certain intracellular pathogens. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 32198 bp of genomic DNA overlapping NRAMP1 on chromosomal region 2q35. The NRAMP1 gene spans 13604 bp. The gene and its 5' genomic region are highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. A second gene was identified in the immediate vicinity of NRAMP1 and was tentatively named Nuclear LIM Interactor-Interacting Factor (NLI-IF) by analogy to its closest ortholog. The human NLI-IF gene begins 4721 bp downstream of the NRAMP1 stop codon and is composed of seven exons varying in size from 57 bp to 1644 bp. The gene gives rise to a 2655-bp mRNA transcript that contains a 783-bp open reading frame. The predicted molecular weight of the 261-amino acid NLI-IF protein is 29.2 kDa. Several putative gene regulatory elements were identified in the 5' upstream region of NLI-IF, including consensus binding sequences for Sp1, AP-2, NF-kappa B, and PU 1. The NLI-IF amino acid sequence has homology to proteins that have a high degree of homology with the NLI-interacting factor from Gallus gallus and are found in divergent species ranging from yeast to plants. NLI-IF is part of a human gene family encoding four related proteins of unknown function. Northern blot analysis of 15 different human tissues revealed a 2.6-kb NLI-IF mRNA that was ubiquitously expressed, but at varying levels. A second transcript with estimated size of 7 kb was expressed only in the placenta. Our data provide new sequence information about the NRAMP1 gene region that will be useful in the search for genetic variants causally involved in altered susceptibility to infectious diseases.

human	Chr	The WFDC1 gene encoding ps20 localizes to 16q24, a region of LOH in multiple cancers. We previously identified ps20 protein as a secreted growth inhibitor and purified the protein from fetal rat prostate urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell conditioned medium. The rat cDNA was subsequently cloned, and ps20 was found to contain a WAP-type four-disulfide core motif, indicating it may function as a protease inhibitor. We now report cloning and characterization of the mouse ps20 gene (designated Wfdc1), the human homolog cDNA, and the human gene (designated WFDC1). Both the mouse and human WFDC1 genes consist of seven exons and encode respective ps20 proteins sharing 79.1% identity and nearly identical WAP motifs in exon 2. The WFDC1 gene was mapped by FISH analysis to human Chromosome (Chr) 16q24, an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously identified in multiple cancers including prostate, breast, hepatocellular, and Wilms' tumor. Identification and characterization of the WFDC1 gene may aid in better understanding the potential role of this gene and ps20 in prostate biology and carcinogenesis.

rapid amplification of cdna	RACE	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor preferentially expressed in leukocytes. Recently cDNA encoding the histamine H3 receptor was isolated after 15 years of considerable research. However, several studies have proposed heterogeneity of the H3 receptor. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor. A novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptor named GPRv53 was obtained through a search of the human genomic DNA data base and analyzed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). GPRv53 possessed the features of biologic amine receptors and had the highest homology with H3 receptor among known G-protein-coupled receptors. Mammalian cells expressing GPRv53 were demonstrated to bind and respond to histamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In functional assays, not only an H3 receptor agonist, R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, but also a H3 receptor antagonist, clobenpropit, and a neuroleptic, clozapine, activated GPRv53-expressing cells. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that expression of GPRv53 is localized in the peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and colon, which was totally different from the H3 receptor, whose expression was restricted to the brain. The discovery of the GPRv53 receptor will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of histamine.
	EVL	The orthologous human and murine semaphorin 6A-1 proteins (SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1) bind to the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like protein (EVL) via a novel carboxyl-terminal zyxin-like domain. Neuronal development and apoptosis critically depend on the transformation of extracellular signals to intracellular actions resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements. Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins play an important role in actin and filament dynamics, whereas members of the semaphorin protein family are guidance signals in embryo- and organogenesis. Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP. In addition these findings suggest a completely new role for transmembranous semaphorins such as SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 in retrograde signaling.

g protein - coupled	GPCRs	A family of heptahelical receptors with adhesion-like domains: a marriage between two super families. Some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are regulators of cell adhesion via inside-out effector signaling pathways. Such is the case with leukocyte chemokine receptors which stimulate intracellular second messenger pathways resulting in upregulation of integrin adhesion to ligands present in the extracellular matrix or on opposing cells resulting in chemotaxis and extravasation during immune surveillance. Remarkably, a family of GPCRs has recently been discovered that may themselves be triggered by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Along with a canonical heptahelical membrane-spanning region, these intriguing proteins contain putative cell adhesion-like modules. The evidence to date suggests that they are involved in lymphocyte activation, macrophage biology, synaptic exocytosis and planar polarization during organogenesis.
centrosomal p4 . 1 - associated	CPAP	Protein 4.1 R-135 interacts with a novel centrosomal protein (CPAP) which is associated with the gamma-tubulin complex. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a novel human centrosomal protein, CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein), which specifically interacts with the head domain of the 135-kDa protein 4.1R isoform (4.1R-135). Sequence analysis revealed that the carboxyl terminus of CPAP has 31.3% amino acid identity with human Tcp-10 (a t-complex responder gene product). Interestingly, most of the sequence identity is restricted to two conserved regions. One carries a leucine zipper, which may form a series of heptad repeats involved in coiled-coil formation; the other contains unusual glycine repeats with unknown function. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CPAP and gamma-tubulin are localized within the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. CPAP cosediments with gamma-tubulin in sucrose gradients and coimmunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin, indicating that CPAP is a part of the gamma-tubulin complex. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that CPAP is localized within the center of microtubule asters and may participate in microtubule nucleation. The formation of microtubule asters was significantly inhibited by anti-CPAP antibody. Together, these observations indicate that CPAP may play an important role in cell division and centrosome function.
activation - induced cytidine deamina	AID	Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency causes the autosomal recessive form of the Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center B cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. We herein report mutations in the human counterpart of AID in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Three major abnormalities characterize AID deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. The phenotype observed in HIGM2 patients (and in AID-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for AID in several crucial steps of B cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.

hemicholinium -	HC-3	Molecular cloning of a human, hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter. Under many physiological circumstances, Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3)-sensitive, high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) in cholinergic neurons is thought to be rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Based on sequence information provided by the Human Genome Project and the recently reported rat CHT1 (rCHT1), we cloned a human CHT cDNA from spinal cord. The hCHT cDNA encodes a protein of 580 amino acids having 93% identity to rCHT1 and 51% identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CHO-1, and is distantly related to members of the Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) gene family of Na(+)-coupled glucose (SGLT), nucleoside and iodide transporters. Northern blot analysis reveals the expression of a approximately 5 kb transcript in human brain regions rich in cholinergic neurons including the putamen, spinal cord, and medulla. Expression of hCHT cDNA in COS-7 cells results in saturable, Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent choline uptake (K(m) = 1.2 microM) in membrane vesicles and [(3)H] HC-3 binding (K(d) = 4 nM) in membrane fractions, consistent with characteristics reported in mammalian cholinergic neurons. Using radiation hybrid mapping techniques, we localized the hCHT gene to human chromosome 2q12. These studies elucidate the primary structure and chromosomal localization of hCHT and provide a basis for mechanistic analysis of HACU regulation and an investigation of the role of hCHT in disease states.

The hCHT cDNA encodes a protein of 580 amino acids having 93% identity to rCHT1 and 51% identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CHO-1, and is distantly related to members of the Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) gene family of Na(+)-coupled glucose (SGLT), nucleoside and iodide transporters. Northern blot analysis reveals the expression of a approximately 5 kb transcript in human brain regions rich in cholinergic neurons including the putamen, spinal cord, and medulla. Expression of hCHT cDNA in COS-7 cells results in saturable, Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent choline uptake (K(m) = 1.2 microM) in membrane vesicles and [(3)H] HC-3 binding (K(d) = 4 nM) in membrane fractions, consistent with characteristics reported in mammalian cholinergic neurons. Using radiation hybrid mapping techniques, we localized the hCHT gene to human chromosome 2q12. These studies elucidate the primary structure and chromosomal localization of hCHT and provide a basis for mechanistic analysis of HACU regulation and an investigation of the role of hCHT in disease states.

human helicase	hHel1	SMARCAD1, a novel human helicase family-defining member associated with genetic instability: cloning, expression, and mapping to 4q22-q23, a band rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants involved in several human diseases. Members of the DEAD/H box-containing helicase superfamily include proteins essential to genome replication, repair, and expression. We report here the cloning and initial characterization of a novel human member of this protein family, designated hHel1 (human helicase 1), now designated SMARCAD1 by HUGO. This DEAD/H box-containing molecule has seven highly conserved sequence regions that allow us to place it in the SNF2 family of the helicase superfamily. Uniquely, though, hHel1 contains two DEAD/H box motifs, a property not reported to be shared by any other SNF2 family members. This defines a new subfamily consisting of hHel1 and its homologues. In addition to these DEAD/H box/ATP-binding motifs, hHel1 has a putative nuclear localization signal and several regions that may mediate protein-protein interactions. Expression analysis indicates that hHel1 transcripts are ubiquitous, with particularly high levels in endocrine tissue. We have mapped the gene for hHel1 to human chromosome 4q22-q23; this region is rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants of genes involved in several human diseases, notably soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. Our observation that human Hel1 gene overexpression is present in an E1A-expressing cell line with increased capacity for gene reactivation events by genomic rearrangement suggests that human Hel1 may play a role in genetic instability development.
membrane - type 6 matrix metalloprotein	MT6-MMP	Membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP, MMP-25) is the second glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored MMP. A recently identified membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP) has a hydrophobic stretch of 24 amino acids at the C-terminus. This hydrophobicity pattern is similar to glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored MMP, MT4-MMP, and other GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, we tested the possibility that MT6-MMP was also a GPI-anchored proteinase. Our results showed that MT6-MMP as well as MT4-MMP were labeled with [3H]ethanolamine indicating the presence of a GPI unit with incorporated label. In addition, phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C treatment released MT6-MMP from the surface of transfected cells. These results strongly indicate that MT6-MMP is a GPI-anchored protein. Since two members of MT-MMPs are now assigned as GPI-anchored proteinase, MT-MMPs can be subgrouped into GPI type and transmembrane type.

anhidrotic ectodermal dyspl	EDA	Two-amino acid molecular switch in an epithelial morphogen that regulates binding to two distinct receptors. Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis.

twik - related acid sensitive k ( + )	TASK	Cloning, localisation and functional expression of a novel human, cerebellum specific, two pore domain potassium channel. We have isolated, by degenerate PCR, a complementary DNA encoding a novel two pore domain potassium channel. This is the 7th functional member of the human tandem pore domain potassium channel family to be reported. It has an open reading frame of 1.125 kb and encodes a 374 amino acid protein which shows 62% identity to the human TASK-1 gene: identity to other human members of the family is 31-35% at the amino acid level. We believe this gene to be human TASK-3, the ortholog of the recently reported rat TASK-3 gene: amino acid identity between the two is 74%. 'Taqman' mRNA analysis demonstrated a very specific tissue distribution pattern, showing human TASK-3 mRNA to be localised largely in the cerebellum, in contrast rat TASK-3 was reported to be widely distributed. We have shown by radiation hybrid mapping that human TASK-3 can be assigned to chromosome 8q24.3. Human TASK-3 was demonstrated to endow Xenopus oocytes with a negative resting membrane potential through the presence of a large K(+) selective conductance. TASK-3 is inhibited by extracellular acidosis with a mid-point of inhibition around pH 6. 5, supporting the predictions from the sequence data that this is a third human TASK (TWIK-related acid sensitive K(+) channel) gene.
myelodysplastic	MDS	A novel gene, MEL1, mapped to 1p36.3 is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene and is transcriptionally activated in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive leukemia cells. The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is frequently characterized by trilineage dysplasia, in particular dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, and poor prognosis. Previously, the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 3q21 was identified within a 60-kilobase (kb) region centromeric to the BCR of 3q21q26 syndrome and that at 1p36.3 within a 90-kb region. In this study, genes were searched near the breakpoints at 1p36.3, and a novel gene was isolated that encoded a zinc finger protein with a PR domain, which is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene. The novel gene, designated as MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1), with 1257 amino acid residues is 64% similar in nucleotide and 63% similar in amino acid sequences to MDS1/EVI1 with the same domain structure. The MEL1 gene is expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) but not in other cell lines or bone marrow, spleen, and fetal liver, suggesting that MEL1 is specifically in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML. On the basis of the positional relationship between the EVI1 and MEL1 genes in each translocation, it was suggested that both genes are transcriptionally activated by the translocation of the 3q21 region with the Ribophorin I gene. Because of the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 family genes in both t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML and 3q21q26 syndrome, it is suggested that they share a common molecular mechanism for the leukemogenic transformation of the cells.

bcl - 2 homo	BH	Bcl-G, a novel pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. A new member of the Bcl-2 family was identified, Bcl-G. The human BCL-G gene consists of 6 exons, resides on chromosome 12p12, and encodes two proteins through alternative mRNA splicing, Bcl-G(L) (long) and Bcl-G(S) (short) consisting of 327 and 252 amino acids in length, respectively. Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S) have identical sequences for the first 226 amino acids but diverge thereafter. Among the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains previously recognized in Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3 domain is found in both Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S), but only the longer Bcl-G(L) protein possesses a BH2 domain. Bcl-G(L) mRNA is expressed widely in adult human tissues, whereas Bcl-G(S) mRNA was found only in testis. Overexpression of Bcl-G(L) or Bcl-G(S) in cells induced apoptosis although Bcl-G(S) was far more potent than Bcl-G(L). Apoptosis induction by Bcl-G(S) depended on the BH3 domain and was suppressed by coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) protein. Bcl-X(L) also coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-G(S) but not with mutants of Bcl-G(S) in which the BH3 domain was deleted or mutated or with Bcl-G(L). Bcl-G(S) was predominantly localized to cytosolic organelles, whereas Bcl-G(L) was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. A mutant of Bcl-G(L) in which the BH2 domain was deleted displayed increased apoptotic activity and coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-X(L), suggesting that the BH2 domain autorepresses Bcl-G(L).
multidrug	MDR	Rab6c, a new member of the rab gene family, is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells. A new Rab6 homolog cDNA, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a human multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the methylation sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) technique. Rab6c was found to be under-expressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (a human MDR uterine sarcoma cell line) compared with their non-MDR parental cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing the exogenous Rab6c exhibited less resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than the control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the transfectants' diminished resistance to DOX was caused by increased drug accumulation induced by the exogenous Rab6c. These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.

None	APL	Genomic organization of the JEM-1 (BLZF1) gene on human chromosome 1q24: molecular cloning and analysis of its promoter region. The Jem-1 (JEM-1, HGMW-approved symbol BLZF1) gene mapping to human chromosome 1q24 codes for a ubiquitously expressed 3-kb mRNA, translated in a 45-kDa nuclear protein. Recent studies have shown a deficient expression of this gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, treatment with retinoids was able to upregulate JEM-1 mRNA in maturing NB4 leukemia cells. Here, we report the characterization of the structural organization of JEM-1. By hybridization screening of a human genomic library derived from blood mononuclear cells, five overlapping genomic DNA clones were isolated. These clones extend over 34 kb of the human genome and comprise the complete JEM-1 gene and a 4-kb 5'flanking region. Determination of the exon-intron structure of Jem-1 revealed seven exons whose junctions with introns exhibited typical splice sequences. A shorter transcript (Jem-1s, 1.3 kb) generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation was identified. Its translation generated a 23-kDa protein that exhibited a cytoplasmic localization. 5'RACE-PCR identified a major transcription start site (TSS) located at 403 nt upstream of the ATG. Computer analysis of the 1. 8-kb 5'flanking region showed that it lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box located 95 bp upstream of the TSS. Sequencing also revealed potential cis-acting elements for multiple transcription regulators including Sp1, GATA, C/EBP, AP-1, and Pu1. No retinoic acid receptor elements or retinoic X receptor elements were detected. This 1.8-kb DNA sequence showed a strong constitutive promoter activity determined by a luciferase-reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Retinoids further increased luciferase expression 2.7-fold. We demonstrated that the 1-kb distal sequence contains yet unidentified elements reducing constitutive transcription. Thus, the maximal constitutive promoter activity was assigned to a -432 + 101 region overlapping the TSS. These data support the idea of a constitutive expression of JEM-1, but a negative regulation in APL released by retinoids.

IL-17E is a ligand for the recently identified protein termed EVI27/IL-17BR, which we term IL-17 receptor homolog 1 (IL-17Rh1) in light of the multiple reported ligand-receptor relationships. Murine EVI27 was identified through its location at a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. IL-17Rh1 shows highest level expression in kidney with moderate expression in multiple other organs, whereas IL-17E mRNA was detected at very low levels in several peripheral tissues. IL-17E induces activation of NF-kappaB and stimulates production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8.

None	PKD2	Molecular cloning and characterization of the human protein kinase D2. A novel member of the protein kinase D family of serine threonine kinases. We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence contains two cysteine-rich motifs at the N terminus, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain containing all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. It exhibits the strongest homology to the serine threonine protein kinases PKD/PKCmicro and PKCnu, particularly in the duplex zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motif, in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the protein kinase domain. In contrast, it shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to other members of the PKC family. Therefore, the new protein has been termed protein kinase D2 (PKD2). The mRNA of PKD2 is widely expressed in human and murine tissues. It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is expressed in various human cell lines, including HL60 cells, which do not express PKCmicro. In vivo phorbol ester binding studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKD2. The addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the presence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine stimulated the autophosphorylation of PKD2 in a synergistic fashion. Phorbol esters also stimulated autophosphorylation of PKD2 in intact cells. PKD2 activated by phorbol esters efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous substrate histone H1. In addition, we could identify the C-terminal Ser(876) residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser(876) of PKD2 correlated with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCK(B)/gastrin receptor. Thus, PKD2 is a novel phorbol ester- and growth factor-stimulated protein kinase.
fanconi an	FA	The Fanconi anemia protein FANCF forms a nuclear complex with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome associated with a strong predisposition to cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma. At the cellular level, FA is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal breakage and a unique hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis has indicated that at least seven distinct genes are involved in the pathogenesis of FA. Despite the identification of four of these genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG), the nature of the 'FA pathway' has remained enigmatic, as the FA proteins lack sequence homologies or motifs that could point to a molecular function. To further define this pathway, we studied the subcellular localizations and mutual interactions of the FA proteins, including the recently identified FANCF protein, in human lymphoblasts. FANCF was found predominantly in the nucleus, where it complexes with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. These interactions were detected in wild-type and FA-D lymphoblasts, but not in lymphoblasts of other FA complementation groups. This implies that each of the FA proteins, except FANCD, is required for these complexes to form. Similarly, we show that the interaction between FANCA and FANCC is restricted to wild-type and FA-D cells. Furthermore, we document the subcellular localization of FANCA and the FANCA/FANCG complex in all FA complementation groups. Our results, along with published data, culminate in a model in which a multi-protein FA complex serves a nuclear function to maintain genomic integrity.
fibroblast growth factor	FGF-2	FIF [fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)-interacting-factor], a nuclear putatively antiapoptotic factor, interacts specifically with FGF-2. Numerous evidence indicates that some of the activities of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) depend on an intracrine mode of action. Recently, we showed that three high molecular mass (HMM) nuclear forms of FGF-2 are part of a 320-kDa protein complex while the cytoplasmic AUG-initiated form is included in a 130-kDa complex. Consequently, the characterization of FGF endogenous targets has become crucial to allow the elucidation of their endogenous activities. Through the screening of GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid expression libraries, we have isolated a gene encoding a nuclear protein of 55 kDa, FIF (FGF-2-interacting-factor), which interacts specifically with FGF-2 but not with FGF-1, FGF-3, or FGF-6. In this system, FIF interacts equally well with the NH2-extended 24-kDa FGF form as with the 18-kDa form, indicating that the FIF-binding motif is located in the last 155 amino acids of FGF-2. Nevertheless, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed an exclusive association with HMM FGF-2. The predicted protein contains a canonical leucine zipper domain and three overlapping hydrophobic heptad repeats. The region spanning these repeats is, together with a region located in the N-terminal part of the FIF protein, implicated in the binding to FGF-2. In contrast to the full-length FIF protein, several deletion constructs were able to transactivate a lac-Z reporter gene. Furthermore, the COOH-terminal part, but not the full-length FIF protein, has previously been shown to exhibit antiapoptotic properties. Thus we discuss the possibility that these activities could reflect a physiological function of FIF through its interaction with FGF-2.

None	CARD	Molecular cloning and characterization of DEFCAP-L and -S, two isoforms of a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. We report the deduced amino acid sequences of two alternately spliced isoforms, designated DEFCAP-L and -S, that differ in 44 amino acids and encode a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. Similar to the other mammalian Ced-4 proteins (Apaf-1 and Nod1), DEFCAP contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a putative nucleotide binding domain, signified by a consensus Walker's A box (P-loop) and B box (Mg(2+)-binding site). Like Nod1, but different from Apaf-1, DEFCAP contains a putative regulatory domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR). However, a distinguishing feature of the primary sequence of DEFCAP is that DEFCAP contains at its NH(2) terminus a pyrin-like motif and a proline-rich sequence, possibly involved in protein-protein interactions with Src homology domain 3-containing proteins. By using in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, both long and short isoforms were capable of strongly interacting with caspase-2 and exhibited a weaker interaction with caspase-9. Transient overexpression of full-length DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF7 resulted in significant levels of apoptosis. In vitro death assays with transient overexpression of deletion constructs of both isoforms using beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene in MCF7 cells suggest the following: 1) the nucleotide binding domain may act as a negative regulator of the killing activity of DEFCAP; 2) the LRR/CARD represents a putative constitutively active inducer of apoptosis; 3) the killing activity of LRR/CARD is inhibitable by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone and to a lesser extent by Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; and 4) the CARD is critical for killing activity of DEFCAP. These results suggest that DEFCAP is a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins capable of inducing apoptosis, and understanding its regulation may elucidate the complex nature of the mammalian apoptosis-promoting machinery.

natural	NK	Interleukin 21 and its receptor are involved in NK cell expansion and regulation of lymphocyte function. Cytokines are important in the regulation of haematopoiesis and immune responses, and can influence lymphocyte development. Here we have identified a class I cytokine receptor that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues and is capable of signal transduction. The full-length receptor was expressed in BaF3 cells, which created a functional assay for ligand detection and cloning. Conditioned media from activated human CD3+ T cells supported proliferation of the assay cell line. We constructed a complementary DNA expression library from activated human CD3+ T cells, and identified a cytokine with a four-helix-bundle structure using functional cloning. This cytokine is most closely related to IL2 and IL15, and has been designated IL21 with the receptor designated IL21 R. In vitro assays suggest that IL21 has a role in the proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cell populations from bone marrow, in the proliferation of mature B-cell populations co-stimulated with anti-CD40, and in the proliferation of T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3.
rho in filopod	Rif	The novel Rho-family GTPase rif regulates coordinated actin-based membrane rearrangements. Small GTPases of the Rho family have a critical role in controlling cell morphology, motility and adhesion through dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [1,2]. Individual Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate distinct components of the cytoskeletal architecture; RhoA stimulates the bundling of actin filaments into stress fibres [3], Rac reorganises actin to produce membrane sheets or lamellipodia [4] and Cdc42 causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia [5]. We have isolated a new Rho-family GTPase, Rif (Rho in filopodia), and shown that it represents an alternative signalling route to the generation of filopodial structures. Coordinated regulation of Rho-family GTPases can be used to generate more complicated actin rearrangements, such as those underlying cell migration [6]. In addition to inducing filopodia, Rif functions cooperatively with Cdc42 and Rac to generate additional structures, increasing the diversity of actin-based morphology.
mitomycin	MMC	Mitomycin C resistance induced by TCF-3 overexpression in gastric cancer cell line MKN28 is associated with DT-diaphorase down-regulation. TCF transcription factors are mediators of the WNT signaling pathway and are antagonized by the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway. Here human TCF-3 has been cloned and characterized. Differential expression analyses of TCF genes in gastric cancer revealed that TCF-1 was expressed in most cases of primary gastric cancer at almost the same level as in normal gastric mucosa and that TCF-3 was occasionally up-regulated in primary gastric cancer. The TCF-3 expression vector was transfected to gastric cancer cell line MKN28 to establish stable transformants. Three independent MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 showed about 8-fold resistance to mitomycin C (MMC; IC50, 2.4 microg/ml) compared with MKN28 vector transfectants (IC50 = 0.3 microg/ml). Among the 10 drug resistance-associated genes examined in this study, the DT-diaphorase (DTD) gene was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3. DTD mRNA was also down-regulated in primary gastric cancer with TCF-3 up-regulation. In addition, DTD protein was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 compared with MKN28 vector transfectants. DTD is implicated in the activation of MMC in target cells, and DTD down-regulation explains MMC resistance. MMC resistance induced by TCF-3 overexpression is probably due to DTD down-regulation, which might provide a possible target for new therapy of drug-resistant gastric cancer.

sorting ne	SNX	Human orthologs of yeast vacuolar protein sorting proteins Vps26, 29, and 35: assembly into multimeric complexes. Sorting nexin (SNX) 1 and SNX2 are mammalian orthologs of Vps5p, a yeast protein that is a subunit of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We report the cloning and characterization of human orthologs of three additional components of the complex: Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins suggests a similarity in function. We used both yeast two-hybrid assays and expression in mammalian cells to define the binding interactions among these proteins. The data suggest a model in which hVps35 serves as the core of a multimeric complex by binding directly to hVps26, hVps29, and SNX1. Deletional analyses of hVps35 demonstrate that amino acid residues 1-53 and 307-796 of hVps35 bind to the coiled coil-containing domain of SNX1. In contrast, hVps26 binds to amino acid residues 1-172 of hVps35, whereas hVps29 binds to amino acid residues 307-796 of hVps35. Furthermore, hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 have been found in membrane-associated and cytosolic compartments. Gel filtration chromatography of COS7 cell cytosol showed that both recombinant and endogenous hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 coelute as a large complex ( approximately 220-440 kDa). In the absence of hVps35, neither hVps26 nor hVps29 is found in the large complex. These data provide the first insights into the binding interactions among subunits of a putative mammalian retromer complex.
olfactory receptor	ORGs	Comparative structural and functional analysis of the olfactory receptor genes flanking the human and mouse beta-globin gene clusters. By sequencing regions flanking the beta-globin gene complex in mouse (Hbbc) and human (HBBC), we have shown that the beta-globin gene cluster is surrounded by a larger cluster of olfactory receptor genes (ORGs). To facilitate sequence comparisons and to investigate the regulation of ORG expression, we have mapped 5' sequences of mRNA from olfactory epithelium encoding beta-globin-proximal ORGs. We have found that several of these genes contain multiple noncoding exons that can be alternatively spliced. Surprisingly, the only common motifs found in the promoters of these genes are a " TATA " box and a purine-rich motif. Sequence comparisons between human and mouse reveal that most of the conserved regions are confined to the coding regions and transcription units of the genes themselves, but a few blocks of conserved sequence also are found outside of ORG transcription units. The possible influence of beta-globin regulatory sequences on ORG expression in olfactory epithelium was tested in mice containing a deletion of the endogenous beta-globin locus control region, but no change in expression of the neighboring ORGs was detected. We evaluate the implications of these results for possible mechanisms of regulation of ORG transcription.
immunoglobu	Ig	Characterization of human sialoadhesin, a sialic acid binding receptor expressed by resident and inflammatory macrophage populations. Sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted cellular interaction molecule and a prototypic member of the Siglec family of sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins. So far, it has only been characterized in rodents. Here, we report the molecular cloning, binding properties, and expression pattern of human sialoadhesin. The predicted protein sequences of human and mouse sialoadhesin are about 72% identical, with the greatest similarity in the extracellular region, which comprises 17 Ig domains in both species. A recombinant protein consisting of the first 4 N-terminal domains of human sialoadhesin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 mediated sialic acid-dependent binding with a specificity similar to its mouse counterpart, preferring sialic acid in the alpha2,3 glycosidic linkage over the alpha2,6 linkage. By flow cytometry with peripheral blood leukocytes, recombinant sialoadhesin bound strongly to granulocytes with intermediate binding to monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and a subset of CD8 T cells. Using antibodies raised to the recombinant protein, sialoadhesin was immunoprecipitated from the THP-1 human monocytic cell line as an approximate 200-kd glycoprotein. The expression pattern of human sialoadhesin was found to be similar to that of the mouse receptor, being absent from monocytes and other peripheral blood leukocytes, but expressed strongly by tissue macrophages in the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, liver, colon, and lungs. High expression was also found on inflammatory macrophages present in affected tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
thioredo	Trx	Identification of a novel thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein. We recently identified a series of transforming growth factor-beta-responsive genes in A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line by a gene trap screening method. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designated TMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. The TMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. This activity was abolished when two Cys residues in the active site sequence were mutated to Ser, suggesting that the Trx-like activity of TMX may help relieve ER stress caused by brefeldin A.

nonsense - mediated	NMD	Human Upf proteins target an mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay when bound downstream of a termination codon. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) rids eukaryotic cells of aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons. These are discriminated from true termination codons by downstream cis-elements, such as exon-exon junctions. We describe three novel human proteins involved in NMD, hUpf2, hUpf3a, and hUpf3b. While in HeLa cell extracts these proteins are complexed with hUpf1, in intact cells hUpf3a and hUpf3b are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, hUpf2 is perinuclear, and hUpf1 cytoplasmic. hUpf3a and hUpf3b associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any hUpf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA elicits NMD. These data suggest that assembly of a dynamic hUpf complex initiates in the nucleus at mRNA exon-exon junctions and triggers NMD in the cytoplasm when recognized downstream of a translation termination site.
g protein - coupled	GPCRs	Identification of four novel human G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the brain. We report the discovery and tissue distributions of four novel human genes, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, all of which encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPR61 was discovered in a search of the patent literature which retrieved a rabbit DNA sequence partially encoding a novel GPCR. This sequence was used to obtain a full-length human cDNA encoding GPR61, a receptor of 417 amino acid length. A search of the GenBank genomic sequence databases revealed three previously unrecognized intronless genes encoding the orphan GPCrs (oGPCRs) GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, with respective amino acid lengths of 368, 419 and 337. Sequence analysis revealed that GPR61 and GPR62, and a published orphan receptor p47MNR, shared the highest level of identities to each other, ranging from 36 to 45% in the transmembrane (TM) domains. Together, these three oGPCRs appear to comprise a novel subfamily of GPCRs, most closely related to the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor. Sequence analysis of GPR63 and GPR77 revealed highest sequence identities in the TM regions with the oGPCR PSP24 (58%) and the anaphylatoxin C5a receptor (49%) respectively. Tissue distribution analyses detected the expression of all four novel genes in the human brain. GPR61 mRNA expression was detected in the caudate, putamen and thalamus of human brain, with a more widespread expression pattern in rat brain, with mRNA signals in areas of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. GPR62 mRNA expression was detected in the basal forebrain, frontal cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. GPR63 mRNA expression was detected in the frontal cortex, with lower levels in the thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus and midbrain. Analysis of GPR77 mRNA expression revealed signals in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus with high transcript levels in the liver.
orphan gpcr	oGPCRs	Identification of four novel human G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the brain. We report the discovery and tissue distributions of four novel human genes, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, all of which encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPR61 was discovered in a search of the patent literature which retrieved a rabbit DNA sequence partially encoding a novel GPCR. This sequence was used to obtain a full-length human cDNA encoding GPR61, a receptor of 417 amino acid length. A search of the GenBank genomic sequence databases revealed three previously unrecognized intronless genes encoding the orphan GPCrs (oGPCRs) GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, with respective amino acid lengths of 368, 419 and 337. Sequence analysis revealed that GPR61 and GPR62, and a published orphan receptor p47MNR, shared the highest level of identities to each other, ranging from 36 to 45% in the transmembrane (TM) domains.

gamma - carboxyglutamic	Gla	Identification of two novel transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid proteins expressed broadly in fetal and adult tissues. The proline-rich gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2 are the founding members of a family of vitamin K-dependent single-pass integral membrane proteins characterized by an extracellular amino terminal domain of approximately 45 amino acids that is rich in Gla. The intracellular carboxyl terminal region of these two proteins contains one or two copies of the sequence PPXY, a motif present in a variety of proteins involved in such diverse cellular functions as signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and protein turnover. In this report, we describe the cloning of the cDNAs for two additional human transmembrane Gla proteins (TMG) of 20-24 kDa named TMG3 and TMG4. These two proteins possess extracellular Gla domains with 13 or 9 potential Gla residues, respectively, followed by membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions and cytoplasmic carboxyl terminal regions that contain PPXY motifs. This emerging family of integral membrane Gla proteins includes proline-rich Gla protein (PRGP) 1, PRGP2, TMG3, and TMG4, all of which are characterized by broad and variable distribution in both fetal and adult tissues. Members of this family can be grouped into two subclasses on the basis of their gene organization and amino acid sequence. These observations suggest novel physiological functions for vitamin K beyond its known role in the biosynthesis of proteins involved in blood coagulation and bone development. The identification and characterization of these proteins may allow a more complete understanding of the teratogenic consequences of exposure in utero to vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin-based anticoagulants.

adp ribosylation	ARFs	Functional characterization of novel human ARFGAP3. ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) are critical in the vesicular trafficking pathway. ARF activity is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have identified recently a novel tentative ARF GAP derived from human fetal liver, ARFGAP3 (originally named as ARFGAP1). In the present study, we demonstrated that ARFGAP3 had GAP activity in vitro and remarked that the GAP activity of ARFGAP3 was regulated by phospholipids, i.e. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate as agonist and phosphatidylcholine as antagonist. ARFGAP3 is a predominantly cytosolic protein, and concentrated in the perinuclear region. Its transient ectopic overexpression in cultured mammalian cells reduced the constitutive secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase, indicating that ectopic overexpression of ARFGAP3 inhibits the early secretory pathway of proteins in vivo. These results demonstrated that ARFGAP3 is a novel GAP for ARF1 and might be involved in intracellular traffic of proteins and vesicular transport as predicted.

williams - beuren	WBS	WBSCR14, a gene mapping to the Williams--Beuren syndrome deleted region, is a new member of the Mlx transcription factor network. Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder associated with haploinsufficiency of multiple genes at 7q11.23. Here, we report the functional characterization of WBS critical region gene 14 (WBSCR14), a gene contained in the WBS commonly deleted region. It encodes a basic-helix--loop--helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor of the Myc/Max/Mad superfamily. WBSCR14 is expressed in multiple tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract. WBSCR14 forms heterodimers with the bHLHZip protein Mlx to bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max, Mlx has no intrinsic transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1, Mad4, Mnt or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription. Preliminary results suggest a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth control. Our data support the view that the Max-like bHLHZip protein, Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network. We thus suggest that WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

tetratricopeptide	TPR	Cargo of kinesin identified as JIP scaffolding proteins and associated signaling molecules. The cargo that the molecular motor kinesin moves along microtubules has been elusive. We searched for binding partners of the COOH terminus of kinesin light chain, which contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Three proteins were found, the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting proteins (JIPs) JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3, which are scaffolding proteins for the JNK signaling pathway. Concentration of JIPs in nerve terminals requires kinesin, as evident from the analysis of JIP COOH-terminal mutants and dominant negative kinesin constructs. Coprecipitation experiments suggest that kinesin carries the JIP scaffolds preloaded with cytoplasmic (dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase) and transmembrane signaling molecules (the Reelin receptor, ApoER2). These results demonstrate a direct interaction between conventional kinesin and a cargo, indicate that motor proteins are linked to their membranous cargo via scaffolding proteins, and support a role for motor proteins in spatial regulation of signal transduction pathways.

cat -	CaT-L	Expression of CaT-like, a novel calcium-selective channel, correlates with the malignancy of prostate cancer. The regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key role in the development and growth of cells. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of a highly calcium-selective channel localized on the human chromosome 7. The sequence of the new channel is structurally related to the gene product of the CaT1 protein cloned from rat duodenum and is therefore called CaT-like (CaT-L). CaT-L is expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but is undetectable in healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, CaT-L is expressed in normal placenta, exocrine pancreas, and salivary glands. New markers with well defined biological function that correlate with aberrant cell growth are needed for the molecular staging of cancer and to predict the clinical outcome. The human CaT-L channel represents a marker for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.
human corneal n - acetylglucosamine 6 - o - sulfotransfera	hCGn6ST	Human corneal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase and mouse intestinal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase both produce keratan sulfate. Human corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST) has been identified by the positional candidate approach as the gene responsible for macular corneal dystrophy (MCD). Because of its high homology to carbohydrate sulfotransferases and the presence of mutations of this gene in MCD patients who lack sulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea and serum, hCGn6ST protein is thought to be a sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. In this report, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST by expressing it in cultured cells. A lysate prepared from HeLa cells transfected with an intact form of hCGn6ST cDNA or culture medium from cells transfected with a secreted form of hCGn6ST cDNA showed an activity of transferring sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc of synthetic oligosaccharide substrates in vitro. When hCGn6ST was expressed together with human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (hKSG6ST), HeLa cells produced highly sulfated carbohydrate detected by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5D4. These results indicate that hCGn6ST transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. Amino acid substitutions in hCGn6ST identical to changes resulting from missense mutations found in MCD patients abolished enzymatic activity. Moreover, mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase had the same activity as hCGn6ST. This observation suggests that mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase is the orthologue of hCGn6ST and functions as a sulfotransferase to produce keratan sulfate in the cornea.

promyelocytic leukemia	PML	A new spectrin, beta IV, has a major truncated isoform that associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies and the nuclear matrix. We isolated cDNAs that encode a 77-kDa peptide similar to repeats 10-16 of beta-spectrins. Its gene localizes to human chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 and mouse chromosome 7, at 7.5 centimorgans. A 289-kDa isoform, similar to full-length beta-spectrins, was partially assembled from sequences in the human genomic DNA data base and completely cloned and sequenced. RNA transcripts are seen predominantly in the brain, and Western analysis shows a major peptide that migrates as a 72-kDa band. This new gene, spectrin betaIV, thus encodes a full-length minor isoform (SpbetaIVSigma1) and a truncated major isoform (SpbetaIVSigma5). Immunostaining of cells shows a micropunctate pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In mesenchymal stem cells, the staining concentrates at nuclear dots that stain positively for the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Expression of SpbetaIVSigma5 fused to green fluorescence protein in cells produces nuclear dots that include all PML bodies, which double in number in transfected cells. Deletion analysis shows that partial repeats 10 and 16 of SpbetaIVSigma5 are necessary for nuclear dot formation. Immunostaining of whole-mount nuclear matrices reveals diffuse positivity with accentuation at PML bodies. Spectrin betaIV is the first beta-spectrin associated with a subnuclear structure and may be part of a nuclear scaffold to which gene regulatory machinery binds.
None	DC-SIGN1	Extensive repertoire of membrane-bound and soluble dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin 1 (DC-SIGN1) and DC-SIGN2 isoforms. Inter-individual variation in expression of DC-SIGN transcripts. Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. The genes for DC-SIGN1, DC-SIGN2, and CD23, another Type II lectin, colocalize to an approximately 85 kilobase pair region on chromosome 19p13.3, forming a cluster of related genes that undergo highly complex alternative splicing events. The molecular diversity of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 is reminiscent of that observed for certain other adhesive cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell connectivity. The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.

The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.
None	PBMCs	Extensive repertoire of membrane-bound and soluble dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin 1 (DC-SIGN1) and DC-SIGN2 isoforms. Inter-individual variation in expression of DC-SIGN transcripts. Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed.

human crooked	crn	Identification of the human crooked neck gene by comparative gene identification. Drosophila melanogaster serves as a useful model organism for functional genomic studies, and its genome project was recently completed. We previously described a comparative-gene-identification approach to assist human ortholog gene identification that involves applying an entire proteome as an alignment template. Analysis of the available 14100 Drosophila protein sequences revealed that 37% of them (5228 sequences) might lead to discoveries of novel human genes. Upon further database interrogations, we found several putative full-length human gene transcripts, including the human crooked neck (crn) gene. Based on sequence gap-closure experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as bioinformatic analysis, we found that the assembled human cDNA contig of crooked neck gene was at least 3903 base pairs in length with alternative splicing variations which encoded mainly for a 687-amino-acid residue protein. The human crooked neck gene was located on chromosome 20 with at least 15 exons. The unique features of the 16 copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif were conserved in the yeast, fly and human crooked neck orthologous proteins, which were important for spliceosome assembly in cells.

human nicotinic acetylcholine	nAChR	Molecular cloning and mapping of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha10 (CHRNA10). We report the isolation and initial characterization of a new member of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit family, alpha10 (CHRNA10), from both inner-ear neuroepithelium and lymphoid tissue. The cDNA is 1959 nucleotides in length, with a coding region predicting a protein of 451 amino acids that is 90% identical to rat alpha10. The alpha10 gene was localized to chromosome 11p15.5. Human alpha10 was detected in human inner-ear tissue, tonsil, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. We also detected the expression of the human nAChR alpha9 (CHRNA9) mRNA in these same tissues using RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization.

eukaryotic initiation factor 4	eIF4E	Negative regulation of protein translation by mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a key component of the translational machinery and an important modulator of cell growth and proliferation. The activity of eIF4E is thought to be regulated by interaction with inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs) and phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) on Ser209 in response to mitogens and cellular stress. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF4E via MNK1 is mediated via the activation of either the Erk or p38 pathway. We further show that expression of active mutants of MNK1 and MNK2 in 293 cells diminishes cap-dependent translation relative to cap-independent translation in a transient reporter assay. The same effect on cap-dependent translation was observed when MNK1 was activated by the Erk or p38 pathway. In line with these findings, addition of recombinant active MNK1 to rabbit reticulocyte lysate resulted in a reduced protein synthesis in vitro, and overexpression of MNK2 caused a decreased rate of protein synthesis in 293 cells. By using CGP 57380, a novel low-molecular-weight kinase inhibitor of MNK1, we demonstrate that eIF4E phosphorylation is not crucial to the formation of the initiation complex, mitogen-stimulated increase in cap-dependent translation, and cell proliferation. Our results imply that activation of MNK by MAP kinase pathways does not constitute a positive regulatory mechanism to cap-dependent translation. Instead, we propose that the kinase activity of MNKs, eventually through phosphorylation of eIF4E, may serve to limit cap-dependent translation under physiological conditions.

il - 22 receptor - alpha	IL-22RA2	A soluble class II cytokine receptor, IL-22RA2, is a naturally occurring IL-22 antagonist. IL-22 is an IL-10 homologue that binds to and signals through the class II cytokine receptor heterodimer IL-22RA1/CRF2-4. IL-22 is produced by T cells and induces the production of acute-phase reactants in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its involvement in inflammation. Here we report the identification of a class II cytokine receptor designated IL-22RA2 (IL-22 receptor-alpha 2) that appears to be a naturally expressed soluble receptor. IL-22RA2 shares amino acid sequence homology with IL-22RA1 (also known as IL-22R, zcytor11, and CRF2-9) and is physically adjacent to IL-20Ralpha and IFN-gammaR1 on chromosome 6q23.3-24.2. We demonstrate that IL-22RA2 binds specifically to IL-22 and neutralizes IL-22-induced proliferation of BaF3 cells expressing IL-22 receptor subunits. IL-22RA2 mRNA is highly expressed in placenta and spleen by Northern blotting. PCR analysis using RNA from various tissues and cell lines showed that IL-22RA2 was expressed in a range of tissues, including those in the digestive, female reproductive, and immune systems. In situ hybridization revealed the dominant cell types expressing IL-22RA2 were mononuclear cells and epithelium. Because IL-22 induces the expression of acute phase reactants, IL-22RA2 may play an important role as an IL-22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory responses.
polycomb -	PcG	CHMP1 is a novel nuclear matrix protein affecting chromatin structure and cell-cycle progression. The Polycomb-group (PcG) is a diverse set of proteins required for maintenance of gene silencing during development. In a screen for conserved partners of the PcG protein Polycomblike (Pcl), we have identified a new protein, human CHMP1 (CHromatin Modifying Protein; CHarged Multivesicular body Protein), which is encoded by an alternative open reading frame in the PRSM1 gene and is conserved in both complex and simple eukaryotes. CHMP1 contains a predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal and distributes as distinct forms to the cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix in all cell lines tested. We have constructed a stable HEK293 cell line that inducibly overexpresses CHMP1 under ecdysone control. Overexpressed CHMP1 localizes to a punctate subnuclear pattern, encapsulating regions of nuclease-resistant, condensed chromatin. These novel structures are also frequently surrounded by increased histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation. CHMP1 can recruit a PcG protein, BMI1, to these regions of condensed chromatin and can cooperate with co-expressed vertebrate Pcl in a Xenopus embryo PcG assay; this is consistent with a role in PcG function. In combination, these observations suggest that CHMP1 plays a role in stable gene silencing within the nucleus.

x - linked mental retar	XLMR	NXF5, a novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family, is lost in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. BACKGROUND: Although X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 2%-3% of the human population, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent interest in this topic led to the identification of several genes for which mutations result in the disturbance of cognitive development. RESULTS: We identified a novel gene that is interrupted by an inv(X)(p21.1;q22) in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Molecular analysis of both breakpoint regions did not reveal an interrupted gene on Xp, but identified a novel nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) gene cluster, Xcen-NXF5-NXF2-NXF4-NXF3-Xqter, in which NXF5 is split by the breakpoint, leading to its functional nullisomy. The predicted NXF5 protein shows high similarity with the central part of the presumed mRNA nuclear export factor TAP/NXF1. Functional analysis of NXF5 demonstrates binding to RNA as well as to the RNA nuclear export-associated protein p15/NXT. In contrast to TAP/NXF1, overexpression studies localized NXF5 in the form of granules in the cell body and neurites of mature hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in mRNA transport. The two newly identified mouse nxf homologs, nxf-a and nxf-b, which also map on X, show highest mRNA levels in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: A novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family is absent in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Although we did not find direct evidence for the involvement of NXF5 in MR, the gene could be involved in development, possibly through a process in mRNA metabolism in neurons.

makorin ring zinc finger -	MKRN2	Phylogenetic conservation of the makorin-2 gene, encoding a multiple zinc-finger protein, antisense to the RAF1 proto-oncogene. Natural endogenous antisense RNAs have been reported in multiple loci, with evidence in some cases supporting a regulatory role for the antisense transcript. Here, we describe a novel gene, makorin RING zinc finger-2 (MKRN2), that overlaps and is antisense to the gene RAF1 in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3' untranslated region of RAF1 orthologues suggests that this relationship may have existed for up to 450 million years. We have also identified MKRN2 orthologues in two species of fish. This places the gene duplication event that created this locus from an ancestral MKRN1 gene early in vertebrate evolution, over 450 million years ago. Northern blot analyses show that human MKRN2 and RAF1 are co-expressed in tissues and cell lines, raising the possibility of mRNA duplex formation. The encoded makorin-2 protein is likely a ribonucleoprotein of unknown function, but its conservation suggests an important cellular role. The data presented here describe a conserved vertebrate MKRN2 gene that is closely associated with the RAF1 locus.
src - like adapter protein -	SLAP-2	Functional cloning of Src-like adapter protein-2 (SLAP-2), a novel inhibitor of antigen receptor signaling. In an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets for autoimmunity and transplant rejection, we developed and performed a large-scale retroviral-based functional screen to select for proteins that inhibit antigen receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes. In addition to known regulators of antigen receptor signaling, we identified a novel adaptor protein, SLAP-2 which shares 36% sequence similarity with the known Src-like adaptor protein, SLAP. Similar to SLAP, SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in B and T cell lines specifically impaired antigen receptor-mediated signaling events, including CD69 surface marker upregulation, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) promoter activation and calcium influx. Signaling induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin was not significantly reduced, suggesting SLAP-2 functions proximally in the antigen receptor signaling cascade. The SLAP-2 protein contains an NH2-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence and SH3 and SH2 Src homology domains, but lacks a tyrosine kinase domain. In antigen receptor-stimulated cells, SLAP-2 associated with several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. Deletion of the COOH terminus of SLAP-2 blocked function and abrogated its association with Cbl. Mutation of the putative myristoylation site of SLAP-2 compromised its inhibitory activity and impaired its localization to the membrane compartment. Our identification of the negative regulator SLAP-2 demonstrates that a retroviral-based screening strategy may be an efficient way to identify and characterize the function of key components of many signal transduction systems.

gdp - d - mannose 4 , 6 - dehydra	GMD	Composition of Drosophila melanogaster proteome involved in fucosylated glycan metabolism. The whole genome approach enables the characterization of all components of any given biological pathway. Moreover, it can help to uncover all the metabolic routes for any molecule. Here we have used the genome of Drosophila melanogaster to search for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fucosylated glycans. Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases. This work can serve as a basis for further whole-genome approaches in mapping all possible glycosylation pathways and as a basic analysis leading to subsequent experimental studies to verify the predictions made in this work.

slam - associated	SAP	Activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by a SAP-independent receptor of the CD2 family. Some CD2 family receptors stimulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through a signaling pathway, which is dependent on the recruitment of an adapter protein called SLAM-associated protein (SAP). In this work we identify a novel leukocyte cell surface receptor of the CD2 family called CD2-like receptor activating cytotoxic cells (CRACC). CRACC is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes, activated B cells, and mature dendritic cells, and activates NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Remarkably, although CRACC displays cytoplasmic motifs similar to those recruiting SAP, CRACC-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in the absence of SAP and requires activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2. Thus, CRACC is a unique CD2-like receptor which mediates NK cell activation through a SAP-independent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated pathway.

endoplasmic retic	ER	FENS-1 and DFCP1 are FYVE domain-containing proteins with distinct functions in the endosomal and Golgi compartments. FENS-1 and DFCP1 are recently discovered proteins containing one or two FYVE-domains respectively. We show that the FYVE domains in these proteins can bind PtdIns3P in vitro with high specificity over other phosphoinositides. Exogenously expressed FENS-1 localises to early endosomes: this localisation requires an intact FYVE domain and is sensitive to wortmannin inhibition. The isolated FYVE domain of FENS-1 also localises to endosomes. These results are consistent with current models of FYVE-domain function in this cellular compartment. By contrast, exogenously expressed DFCP1 displays a predominantly Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vesicular distribution with little or no overlap with FENS-1 or other endosomal markers. Overexpression of DFCP1 was found to cause dispersal of the Golgi compartment defined by giantin and gpp130-staining. Disruption of the FYVE domains of DFCP1 causes a shift to more condensed and compact Golgi structures and overexpression of this mutant was found to confer significant protection to the Golgi against brefeldin-induced dispersal. These properties of DFCP1 are surprising, and suggest FYVE domain-localisation and function may not be exclusively endosomal. Movies available on-line
twik - related acid - sensitive k ( +	TASK	Expression pattern in brain of TASK-1, TASK-3, and a tandem pore domain K(+) channel subunit, TASK-5, associated with the central auditory nervous system. TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) (TASK) channels contribute to setting the resting potential of mammalian neurons and have recently been defined as molecular targets for extracellular protons and volatile anesthetics. We have isolated a novel member of this subfamily, hTASK-5, from a human genomic library and mapped it to chromosomal region 20q12-20q13. hTASK-5 did not functionally express in Xenopus oocytes, whereas chimeric TASK-5/TASK-3 constructs containing the region between M1 and M3 of TASK-3 produced K(+) selective currents. To better correlate TASK subunits with native K(+) currents in neurons the precise cellular distribution of all TASK family members was elucidated in rat brain. A comprehensive in situ hybridization analysis revealed that both TASK-1 and TASK-3 transcripts are most strongly expressed in many neurons likely to be cholinergic, serotonergic, or noradrenergic. In contrast, TASK-5 expression is found in olfactory bulb mitral cells and Purkinje cells, but predominantly associated with the central auditory pathway. Thus, TASK-5 K(+) channels, possibly in conjunction with auxiliary proteins, may play a role in the transmission of temporal information in the auditory system.
phagocytic c1q	C1qRp	Identification of human CD93 as the phagocytic C1q receptor (C1qRp) by expression cloning. CD93 is a approximately 120 kDa O-sialoglycoprotein that within the hematopoietic system is selectively expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage. So far, its primary structure and function were unknown. We used retroviral-expression cloning to isolate the CD93 cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that CD93 is identical to a protein on human phagocytes termed C1q receptor (C1qRp). C1qRp was shown previously to mediate enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes and was suggested to be a receptor of C1q and two other structurally related molecules. When studying CD93 transductants and control cells, we found that cells expressing CD93 have enhanced capacity to bind C1q. Furthermore, we show that immature dendritic cells (DC) express CD93/C1qRp, and mature DC, known to have reduced capacity for antigen uptake and to have lost the ability to phagocytose, show weak-to-negative CD93/C1qRp expression.

telomeric repeat binding factor	TRF1	The telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase 1, contains multiple binding sites for telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and a novel acceptor, 182-kDa tankyrase-binding protein (TAB182). Tankyrase 1, a human telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was originally identified through its interaction with TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1 in vitro, and its overexpression induces telomere elongation in human cancer cells. In addition to its telomeric localization, tankyrase 1 resides at multiple subcellular sites, suggesting additional functions for this protein. Here we identify TAB182, a novel tankyrase 1-binding protein of 182 kDa. TAB182 displays a complex pattern of subcellular localization. TAB182 localizes to the nucleus in a heterochromatic staining pattern and to the cytoplasm, where it co-stains with the cortical actin network. TAB182 coimmunoprecipitates with tankyrase 1 from human cells and serves as an acceptor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 in vitro. Like TRF1, TAB182 binds to the ankyrin domain (comprising 24 ankyrin repeats) of tankyrase 1. Surprisingly, dissection of this domain reveals multiple discrete and overlapping binding sites for TRF1 and TAB182. Thus, we demonstrate five well conserved ankyrin repeat clusters in tankyrase 1. Although each of the five ankyrin repeat clusters independently binds to TRF1, only three of the five bind toTAB182. These findings suggest that tankyrase 1 may act as a scaffold for large molecular mass complexes made up of multiple binding proteins. We discuss potential roles for tankyrase 1-mediated higher order complexes at telomeres and at other subcellular sites.
src - like adapter protein -	SLAP-2	A novel Src homology 2 domain-containing molecule, Src-like adapter protein-2 (SLAP-2), which negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling. We have cloned a novel adapter protein containing Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains similar to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This molecule lacks a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and is related to a previously identified protein, Src-like adapter protein (SLAP), and is therefore designated SLAP-2. Northern blot analysis indicates that SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in the immune system. Jurkat T cells express SLAP-2 protein and overexpression of SLAP-2 in these cells negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling as assessed by interleukin-2 promoter or NF-AT promoter reporter constructs. Mutational analysis revealed that an intact SH2 domain of SLAP-2 is essential for this inhibitory effect, whereas mutation of the SH3 domain alone has no effect. This inhibitory effect is upstream of the activation of Ras and increase of intracellular calcium levels, as no inhibition was observed when the cells were activated by phorbol ester plus ionomycin. SLAP-2 interacts with Cbl in vivo in a phosphorylation independent manner and with ZAP-70 and T cell receptor zeta chain upon T cell receptor activation. Finally, we show that the mutation of a predicted myristoylation site within the NH(2)-terminal of SLAP-2 is essential for its inhibitory effect. This report therefore implicates SLAP and SLAP-2 as a family of adapter proteins that negatively regulate T cell receptor signaling.

nucleolar rna - associated	Nrap	Isolation and characterization of a new nucleolar protein, Nrap, that is conserved from yeast to humans. BACKGROUND: The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and processing in eukaryotic cells, but its composition remains poorly understood. RESULTS: We have identified a novel nucleolar RNA-associated protein (Nrap) which is highly conserved from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to human, with homologues in mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and other species. In the mouse, we have found that Nrap is ubiquitously expressed and is specifically localized in the nucleolus. We have also identified splice variants in human and mouse, and defined the intron-exon structure of the human Nrap gene. Nrap is inherited into daughter nuclei by associating with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis. RNase treatment of permeabilized cells indicated that the nucleolar localization of Nrap is RNA dependent. The effects of actinomycin D, cycloheximide and 5,6-dichloro-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole on Nrap expression and distribution in cultured cells suggest that Nrap is associated with the pre-rRNA transcript. CONCLUSIONS: Nrap is a large nucleolar protein (of more than 1000 amino acids), and is a new class of protein with new structural and functional motifs. Nrap appears to be associated with ribosome biogenesis by interacting with pre-rRNA primary transcript.
histone deacety	HDAC	Identification of mammalian Sds3 as an integral component of the Sin3/histone deacetylase corepressor complex. Silencing of gene transcription involves local chromatin modification achieved through the local recruitment of large multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The mammalian corepressors mSin3A and mSin3B have been shown to play a key role in this process by tethering HDACs 1 and 2 to promoter-bound transcription factors. Similar mechanisms appear to be operative in yeast, in which epistasis experiments have established that the mSin3 and HDAC orthologs (SIN3 and RPD3), along with a novel protein, SDS3, function in the same repressor pathway. Here, we report the identification of a component of the mSin3-HDAC complex that bears homology to yeast SDS3, physically associates with mSin3 proteins in vivo, represses transcription in a manner that is partially dependent on HDAC activity, and enables HDAC1 catalytic activity in vivo. That key physical and functional properties are also shared by yeast SDS3 underscores the central role of the Sin3-HDAC-Sds3 complex in eukaryotic cell biology, and the discovery of mSds3 in mammalian cells provides a new avenue for modulating the activity of this complex in human disease.
atp binding	ABC	Isolation of a genomic clone containing the promoter region of the human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6. We previously reported on the isolation of a new rat ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6. We now report the isolation of the full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing the human ABCB6 gene. ABCB6 is 100% identical to the cloned MTABC3 human ABC transporter and contains the typical ABC signature, Walker A and B motifs. We found that HuABCB6 is expressed at low levels in normal human liver. We found that ABCB6 was overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas compared to paired surrounding non-malignant tissue. We found that there was no difference in ABCB6 gene copy between human liver cancer and its paired non-malignant tissue. Because HuABCB6 was overexpressed in human cancers compared to peri-tumoral tissue in the absence of gene amplification, transcriptional regulation may play an important role in its expression. Therefore, we isolated a 14 kb genomic DNA clone containing the HuABCB6 promoter and 5'-flanking region. The 5'-flanking region contains a CpG island, lacks an appropriately positioned TATA element and contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. Two transcription start sites were identified by S1 nuclease mapping at -274 and -296 bp from the start codon. Transient transfection of the HuABCB6 promoter constructs (HuABCB6/1.68, 1.39, 1.13, 0.90, 0.52) containing the luciferase reporter gene resulted in a 1100-2300-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the empty vector control whereas HuABCB6/1.68 subcloned in the reverse orientation resulted in no activity. We observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity with the promoter constructs, HuABCB6/0.25, 0.15 and 0.06, which indicates that an orientation-dependent functional promoter is contained within our previously predicted promoter region of -315 bp to -565 bp as deletion of this 250 bp sequence resulted in a loss of promoter activity.

None	HNF1alpha	Mirk protein kinase is activated by MKK3 and functions as a transcriptional activator of HNF1alpha. Mirk/Dyrk1B is an arginine-directed serine/threonine protein kinase that is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues but at elevated levels in many tumor cell lines and in normal skeletal muscle. Colon carcinoma cell lines stably overexpressing Mirk proliferated in serum-free medium, but the mechanism of Mirk action is unknown. DCoHm (dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha ( HNF1alpha) from muscle), a novel gene of the DCoH family with 78% amino acid identity to DCoH, was identified as a Mirk-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis and cloned. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with DCoHm and bound to DCoHm in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. DCoH stabilizes HNF1alpha as a dimer and enhances its transcriptional activity on the beta-fibrinogen promoter reporter, and DCoHm had similar activity. Mirk enhanced HNF1alpha transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas two kinase-inactive Mirk mutants and a Mirk N-terminal deletion mutant did not. Mirk, DCoHm, and HNF1alpha formed a complex. Mirk bound to a specific region within the CREB-binding protein-binding region of HNF1alpha and phosphorylated HNF1alpha at a site adjacent to the Mirk-binding region. Conversely, the HNF1alpha binding domain was located within the first five conserved kinase subdomains of Mirk. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with the MAPK kinase MKK3, an upstream activator of p38. MKK3 enhanced Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF1alpha by Mirk, suggesting that Mirk, like p38, is activated by certain environmental stress agents. The Mirk-binding protein DCoH has been shown to be selectively expressed in colon carcinomas but not in normal tissue. Mirk may function as an HNF1alpha transcriptional activator in response to an MKK3-mediated stress signal, and the selective expression of DCoH could restrict the Mirk response to carcinoma cells.

poly ( a ) binding	PABP	Paip1 interacts with poly(A) binding protein through two independent binding motifs. The 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs plays an important role in the regulation of translation. The poly(A) binding protein (PABP) interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), a component of the eIF4F complex, which binds to the 5' cap structure. The PABP-eIF4G interaction brings about the circularization of the mRNA by joining its 5' and 3' termini, thereby stimulating mRNA translation. The activity of PABP is regulated by two interacting proteins, Paip1 and Paip2. To study the mechanism of the Paip1-PABP interaction, far-Western, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed. Paip1 contains two binding sites for PABP, PAM1 and PAM2 (for PABP-interacting motifs 1 and 2). PAM2 consists of a 15-amino-acid stretch residing in the N terminus, and PAM1 encompasses a larger C-terminal acidic-amino-acid-rich region. PABP also contains two Paip1 binding sites, one located in RNA recognition motifs 1 and 2 and the other located in the C-terminal domain. Paip1 binds to PABP with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an apparent K(d) of 1.9 nM.

fibroblast growth	FGF	Human sprouty 4, a new ras antagonist on 5q31, interacts with the dual specificity kinase TESK1. The Drosophila melanogaster protein sprouty is induced upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor tyrosine kinase activation and acts as an inhibitor of the ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of these receptors. By differential display RT-PCR of activated vs. resting umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) we detected a new human sprouty gene, which we designated human sprouty 4 (hspry4) based on its homology with murine sprouty 4. Hspry4 is widely expressed and Northern blots indicate that different isoforms of hspry4 are induced upon cellular activation. The hspry4 gene maps to 5q31.3. It encodes a protein of 322 amino acids, which, in support of a modulating role in signal transduction, contains a prototypic cysteine-rich region, three, potentially Src homology 3 (SH3) binding, proline-rich regions and a PEST sequence. This new sprouty orthologue can suppress the insulin- and EGF-receptor transduced MAP kinase signaling pathway, but fails to inhibit MAP kinase activation by constitutively active V12 ras. Hspry4 appears to impair the formation of active GTP-ras and exert its activity at the level of wild-type ras or upstream thereof. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, using hspry4 as bait, testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) was identified from a human fetal liver cDNA library as a partner of hspry4. The hspry4-TESK1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and increases by growth factor stimulation. The two proteins colocalize in apparent cytoplasmic vesicles and do not show substantial translocation to the plasma membrane upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation.

In a yeast two-hybrid screen, using hspry4 as bait, testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) was identified from a human fetal liver cDNA library as a partner of hspry4. The hspry4-TESK1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and increases by growth factor stimulation. The two proteins colocalize in apparent cytoplasmic vesicles and do not show substantial translocation to the plasma membrane upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation.
survival of motor	SMN	Identification and characterization of Gemin7, a novel component of the survival of motor neuron complex. The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the gene mutated or deleted in the neurodegenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a large macromolecular complex that also contains Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6. The SMN complex functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and probably other ribonucleoprotein particles. We have identified a novel protein component of the SMN complex termed Gemin7 using native purified SMN complexes and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments demonstrate that Gemin7 is a component of the SMN complex and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding experiments show that Gemin7 interacts directly with SMN and Gemin6 and mediates the association of Gemin6 with the SMN complex. The amino acid sequence of Gemin7 does not contain any recognizable motifs with the exception of several arginine and glycine repeats that are necessary for its interaction with SMN. Moreover, Gemin7 interacts with several Sm proteins of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, in particular, with SmE. With the identification of Gemin7, the inventory of the core components of the SMN complex appears essentially complete.
fanconi ana	FA	FANCE: the link between Fanconi anaemia complex assembly and activity. The Fanconi anaemia (FA) nuclear complex (composed of the FA proteins A, C, G and F) is essential for protection against chromosome breakage. It activates the downstream protein FANCD2 by monoubiquitylation; this then forges an association with the BRCA1 protein at sites of DNA damage. Here we show that the recently identified FANCE protein is part of this nuclear complex, binding both FANCC and FANCD2. Indeed, FANCE is required for the nuclear accumulation of FANCC and provides a critical bridge between the FA complex and FANCD2. Disease-associated FANCC mutants do not bind to FANCE, cannot accumulate in the nucleus and are unable to prevent chromosome breakage.
poly ( adp - ribose ) glycohydro	PARG	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 cleavage during apoptosis: an update. Poly(ADP-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins playing a crucial role in many processes, including DNA repair and cell death. The best known poly(ADP-ribosylating) enzyme, PARP-1, is a DNA nick sensor and uses betaNAD(+) to form polymers of ADP-ribose which are further bound to nuclear protein acceptors. To strictly regulate poly(ADP-ribose) turnover, its degradation is assured by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). During apoptosis, PARP-1 plays two opposite roles: its stimulation leads to poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, whereas caspases cause PARP-1 cleavage and inactivation. PARP-1 proteolysis produces an 89 kDa C-terminal fragment, with a reduced catalytic activity, and a 24 kDa N-terminal peptide, which retains the DNA binding domains. The fate and the possible role of these fragments during apoptosis will be discussed.
aminopeptidase	APB	Human aminopeptidase B (rnpep) on chromosome 1q32.2: complementary DNA, genomic structure and expression. Aminopeptidase B (APB) is a Zn(2+)-metalloexopeptidase, which selectively removes Arg and/or Lys residues from the N-terminus of several peptide substrates. Several data strongly support the hypothesis that this enzyme could participate in the final stages of precursor processing mechanisms and/or in particular inflammatory processes and tumor developments. Therefore, we have cloned the complementary DNA encoding the human APB, a 658-residues protein, containing the canonical " HEXXH(X(18))E " , a signature allowing its classification in the M1 family of metallopeptidases. The genomic structure of the human APB gene (rnpep; 1q32.1-q32.2) was also determined. rnpep is bracketed by pre-protein translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane gene and ETS family transcription factor ELF3 gene. It spans more than 24 kbp and contains 11 exons ranging from 109 to 574 bp. Finally, expression of the human APB messenger RNA (mRNA) was investigated using a pre-made dot-blot. This mRNA seems to be ubiquitous although its expression level varies depending of the cells or tissues considered.

mitochondrial potential	MPT	Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation attenuates beta-lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in human osteosarcoma cells. beta-Lapachone, a novel anticancer drug, induces various human carcinoma cells to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, we report here that, in human osteocarcinoma (U2-OS) cells, beta-lapachone induces necrosis rather than apoptosis. beta-Lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in U2-OS cells was characterized by propidium iodide uptake, cytochrome c release, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP depletion. The mitochondrial potential transition (MPT), including the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, occurred in beta-lapachone-treated cells; cotreatment of these cells with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of MPT pore, failed to prevent necrotic cell death. This indicates that the MPT transition does not play a crucial role in this process. Furthermore, beta-lapachone-induced necrosis was independent of oxidative stress and caspase activation. However, excessive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and subsequent depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP were seen in beta-lapachone-treated U2-OS cells. Cotreatment with a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, decreased beta-lapachone-induced PARP activation and provided significant protection from necrosis by preventing depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP plays an important role in the signaling pathway for beta-lapachone-induced necrosis in U2-OS cells.

nuclear pore	NPC	Enzymes of the SUMO modification pathway localize to filaments of the nuclear pore complex. SUMOs are small ubiquitin-related polypeptides that are reversibly conjugated to many nuclear proteins. Although the number of identified substrates has grown rapidly, relatively little is still understood about when, where, and why most proteins are modified by SUMO. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes involved in the SUMO modification and demodification of proteins are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that SENP2, a SUMO protease that is able to demodify both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 protein conjugates, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. The unique amino-terminal domain of SENP2 interacts with the FG repeat domain of Nup153, indicating that SENP2 associates with the nucleoplasmic basket of the NPC. We also investigated the localization of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Using immunogold labeling of isolated nuclear envelopes, we found that Ubc9 localizes to both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. In vitro binding studies revealed that Ubc9 and SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 bind synergistically to form a trimeric complex with a component of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC, Nup358. Our results indicate that both SUMO modification and demodification of proteins may occur at the NPC and suggest a connection between the SUMO modification pathway and nucleocytoplasmic transport.
thyroid hormone receptor - associated	TRAP	A coregulatory role for the TRAP-mediator complex in androgen receptor-mediated gene expression. The human thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-Mediator complex was originally identified as a large multimeric complex that copurifies with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) from HeLa cells and markedly enhances TR-mediated transcription in vitro. More recent studies have implicated TRAP-Mediator as a coactivator for a broad range of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other classes of transcriptional activators. Here we present evidence that TRAP-Mediator plays a functional role in androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription. We show that several subunits of the complex ligand-dependently coimmunoprecipitate with AR from both prostate cancer LNCaP cells and from HeLa cells stably transfected with AR. The 220-kDa subunit of the complex (TRAP220) can contact the ligand-binding domain of AR in vitro, possibly implicating TRAP220 involvement in targeting AR to the holocomplex. Consistent with a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role, transient overexpression of the TRAP220, TRAP170, and TRAP100 subunits enhanced ligand-dependent transcription by AR in cultured cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that TRAP220 is recruited to the androgen-responsive prostate-specific antigen gene promoter in vivo in ligand-stimulated LNCaP cells. Collectively, these data suggest that TRAP-Mediator may play an important coregulatory role in AR-mediated gene expression.

x - linked ectodermal dysplasia	XEDAR	Role of TRAF3 and -6 in the activation of the NF-kappa B and JNK pathways by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor. X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.

cyclic amp - response - element - binding protein - related	CREB-RP	Physical interaction between hepatitis C virus NS4B protein and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.

sterile alpha	SAM	Complex transcriptional effects of p63 isoforms: identification of novel activation and repression domains. p63 is a transcription factor structurally related to the p53 tumor suppressor. The C-terminal region differs from p53's in that it contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and is subject to multiple alternative splicings. The N-terminal region is present in the transactivation (TA) and DeltaN configurations, with the latter lacking the transcriptional activation domain 1. Single amino acid substitutions and frameshift mutations of p63 cause the human ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia clefting (AEC) or ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting (EEC) syndromes. We have systematically compared the activities of the wild-type p63 isoforms and of the natural mutants in activation and repression assays on three promoters modulated by p53. We found that p63 proteins with an altered SAM domain or no SAM domain-the beta isoforms, the EEC frameshift mutant, and the missense AEC mutations-all showed a distinctly higher level of activation of the MDM2 promoter and decreased repression on the HSP70 promoter. Fusion of SAM to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain repressed a heterologous promoter. A second activation domain, TA2, corresponding to exons 11 to 12, was uncovered by comparing the activation of DeltaN isoforms on natural promoters and in GAL4 fusion systems. In colony formation assays, the AEC mutants, but not the EEC frameshift, were consistently less efficient in suppressing growth, in both the TA version and the DeltaN version, with respect to their p63alpha counterparts. These data highlight the modularity of p63, identifying the SAM domain as a dominant transcriptional repression module and indicating that the AEC and EEC frameshift mutants are characterized by a subversion of the p63 transcriptional potential.

dorsal root gang	DRG	Nociceptive sensitization by the secretory protein Bv8. 1 The small protein Bv8, isolated from amphibian skin, belongs to a novel family of secretory proteins (Bv8-Prokineticin family, SWISS-PROT: Q9PW66) whose orthologues have been conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to humans. 2 When injected intravenously or subcutaneously (from 0.06 to 500 pmol kg(-1)) or intrathecally (from 6 fmol to 250 pmol) in rats, Bv8 produced an intense systemic nociceptive sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the tail and paws. 3 Topically delivered into one rat paw, 50 fmol of Bv8 decreased by 50% the nociceptive threshold to pressure in the injected paw without affecting the threshold in the contralateral paw. 4 The two G-protein coupled prokineticin receptors, PK-R1 and PK-R2, were expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in dorsal quadrants of spinal cord (DSC) and bound Bv8 and the mammalian orthologue, EG-VEGF, with high affinity. In DSC, PK-R1 was more abundant than PK-R2, whereas both receptors were equally expressed in DRG. IC(50) of Bv8 and EG-VEGF to inhibit [(125)I]-Bv8 binding to rat DRG and DSC were 4.1+/-0.4 nM Bv8 and 76.4+/-7.6 nM EG-VEGF, in DRG; 7.3+/-0.9 nM Bv8 and 330+/-41 nM EG-VEGF, in DSC. 5 In the small diameter neurons ( < 30 microm) of rat DRG cultures, Bv8 concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 10 nM, raised [Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner. 6 These data suggest that Bv8, through binding to PK receptors of DSC and primary sensitive neurons, results in intense sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to thermal and mechanical stimuli.
reverse - transcription polymerase chain	RT-PCR	The human tuftelin gene and the expression of tuftelin in mineralizing and nonmineralizing tissues. Tuftelin has been suggested to play an important role during the development and mineralization of enamel, but its precise function is still unclear. This article reviews major milestones in the discovery, structural characterization, expression, localization, and conservation of tuftelin in different vertebrate species. It focuses on the structure of the human tuftelin gene, which has recently been deciphered [12]. It describes the exon-intron organization, sizes and structure, the promoter structure, and the newly discovered alternatively spliced human tooth-bud tuftelin mRNA transcripts. It also examines information on the structural motifs in the human-derived tuftelin protein and how they relate to tuftelin from other species. It reviews our recent results on the transcription of tuftelin mRNA and protein expression in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by DNA cloning and sequencing, indirect immunohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy, and in situ hybridization. These results and earlier Northern blot results show that tuftelin, in addition to being expressed in the developing and mineralizing tooth, is also expressed in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, suggesting that tuftelin has a universal function and/or a multifunctional role.
interleukin	IL-21	Human IL-21 and IL-4 bind to partially overlapping epitopes of common gamma-chain. Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a recently identified novel cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of B, T, and NK cell functions. Its effects depend on binding to and signaling through an IL-21 receptor complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)). In this study using biosensor technique, the ligand-binding properties of IL-21R and gamma(c), which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were analyzed employing recombinant ectodomains of IL-21R and gamma(c). The formation of a binary complex between IL-21 and immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 70pM), gamma(c) and immobilized IL-21 (K(D) 160 microM) and a ternary complex between gamma(c) and IL-21 saturated immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 160nM) could be analyzed. The gamma(c) residues involved in IL-21 binding were defined by alanine-scanning mutational analysis. The epitope comprises gamma(c) residues N44, Y103, N128, L161, E162, and L208. It is not identical but partially overlapping with the previously established gamma(c) epitope for IL-4 binding. These results open the way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the IL-21 receptor system and also the promiscuous binding properties of gamma(c).

These results open the way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the IL-21 receptor system and also the promiscuous binding properties of gamma(c).
common gamma -	gamma(c)	Human IL-21 and IL-4 bind to partially overlapping epitopes of common gamma-chain. Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a recently identified novel cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of B, T, and NK cell functions. Its effects depend on binding to and signaling through an IL-21 receptor complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)). In this study using biosensor technique, the ligand-binding properties of IL-21R and gamma(c), which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were analyzed employing recombinant ectodomains of IL-21R and gamma(c). The formation of a binary complex between IL-21 and immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 70pM), gamma(c) and immobilized IL-21 (K(D) 160 microM) and a ternary complex between gamma(c) and IL-21 saturated immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 160nM) could be analyzed. The gamma(c) residues involved in IL-21 binding were defined by alanine-scanning mutational analysis. The epitope comprises gamma(c) residues N44, Y103, N128, L161, E162, and L208. It is not identical but partially overlapping with the previously established gamma(c) epitope for IL-4 binding.

toll / interleukin - 1	TIR	TIRP, a novel Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein involved in TIR signaling. The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) family members play important roles in host defense. These receptors signal through TIR domain-containing adapter proteins. In this report, we identified a novel TIR domain-containing adapter protein designated as TIRP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TIRP is associated with IL-1 receptors. TIRP also interacts with kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK-4, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and TRAF6. Overexpression of TIRP activates NF-kappaB and potentiates IL-1 receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation. A dominant negative mutant of TIRP inhibits IL-1- but not tumor necrosis factor-triggered NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, TIRP-mediated NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta. Our findings suggest that TIRP is involved in IL-1-triggered NF-kappaB activation and functions upstream of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta

mamba intestinal protein	MIT1	The AVIT protein family. Secreted cysteine-rich vertebrate proteins with diverse functions. Homologues of a protein originally isolated from snake venom and frog skin secretions are present in many vertebrate species. They contain 80-90 amino acids, 10 of which are cysteines with identical spacing. Various names have been given to these proteins, such as mamba intestinal protein 1 (MIT1), Bv8 (Bombina variegata molecular mass approximately 8 kDa), prokineticins and endocrine-gland vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF). Their amino-terminal sequences are identical, and so we propose that the sequence of their first four residues, AVIT, is used as a name for this family. From a comparison of the sequences, two types of AVIT proteins can be discerned. These proteins seem to be distributed widely in mammalian tissues and are known to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. Members of this family have been shown to stimulate contraction of the guinea pig ileum, to cause hyperalgesia after injection into rats and to be active as specific growth factors. Moreover, the messenger RNA level of one of these AVIT proteins changes rhythmically in the region of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This shows that members of this new family of small proteins are involved in diverse biological processes.

beta - site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme	BACE1	Antagonistic effects of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzymes 1 and 2 on beta-amyloid peptide production in cells. The deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease. The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an integral membrane aspartyl protease responsible for cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the beta-site, promotes A beta production. A second integral membrane aspartyl protease related to BACE1, referred to as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) has also been demonstrated to cleave APP at the beta-cleavage site in transfected cells. The role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production remains unresolved. We investigated the role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production in cells by selective inactivation of its transcripts using RNA interference. We are able to reduce steady state levels for mRNA for each enzyme by >85%, and protein amounts by 88-94% in cells. Selective inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells, as expected. Selective inactivation of BACE2 by RNAi results in increased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells. Simultaneous targeting of both enzymes by RNA interference does not have any net effect on A beta released from cells. Our observations of changes in APP metabolism and A beta are consistent with a role of BACE2 in suppressing A beta production in cells that co-express both enzymes.

interleukin -	IL-1	Characterization of Pellino2, a substrate of IRAK1 and IRAK4. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are central components of Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) signaling pathways. In an attempt to discover novel signal transducers in TIR signaling, we identified human Pellino2 as an interaction partner of IRAK4. Pellino2 interacts with kinase-active as well as kinase-inactive IRAK1 and IRAK4. Furthermore, Pellino2 is one of the first substrates identified for IRAK1 and IRAK4. Functional studies using overexpression or RNAi knock-down of Pellino2 suggest a role of Pellino2 as a scaffolding protein similar to Pellino1. However, unlike Pellino1, Pellino2 does not seem to activate a specific transcription factor, but links TIR signaling to basic cellular processes.

variable charge x /	VCX/Y	Expression and localization of VCX/Y proteins and their possible involvement in regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis. Variable Charge X/Y (VCX/Y) is a human testis-specific gene family that localized on X and Y chromosomes. In this study, VCY protein was expressed in E. coli in the form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. With the purified fusion protein as antigen, the anti-GST-VCY antibody was generated and the localization of VCY protein in human testis was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the testis seminiferous epithelium, VCY proteins were highly expressed in nuclei of germ cells. Using propidium iodide staining and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag technologies, VCY and VCX-8r proteins were mainly localized in the nucleoli of COS7 cells. In addition, the colocalization for VCY and VCX-8r in COS7 cells was also observed. With VCY cDNA as bait, a cDNA fragment of acidic ribosomal protein PO was obtained using yeast two-hybrid system. All the information above indicates that VCX/Y protein family might be involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.

endoplasmic retic	ER	VIPL, a VIP36-like membrane protein with a putative function in the export of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsets of glycoproteins are thought to require lectin-like membrane receptors for efficient export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify new members related to two previously characterized intracellular lectins ERGIC-53/p58 and VIP36, we carried out an extensive database search using the conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) as a search string. A gene, more closely related to VIP36 than to ERGIC-53/p58, and hence called VIPL (VIP36-Like), was identified. VIPL has been conserved through evolution from zebra fish to man. The 2.4-kb VIPL mRNA was widely expressed to varying levels in different tissues. Using an antiserum prepared against the CRD, the 32-kDa VIPL protein was detected in various cell lines. The single N-linked glycan of VIPL remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive during a 2-h pulse-chase, even when the protein was overexpressed or mutated to allow export to the plasma membrane. VIPL localized primarily to the ER and partly to the Golgi complex. Like VIP36, the cytoplasmic tail of VIPL terminates in the sequence KRFY, a motif characteristic for proteins recycling between the ER and ERGIC/cis-Golgi. Mutating the retrograde transport signal KR to AA resulted in transport of VIPL to the cell surface. Finally, knock-down of VIPL mRNA using siRNA significantly slowed down the secretion of two glycoproteins (M(R) 35 and 250 kDa) to the medium, suggesting that VIPL may also function as an ER export receptor.

l - type amino acid transporter	LAT3	Identification of a novel system L amino acid transporter structurally distinct from heterodimeric amino acid transporters. A cDNA that encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter was isolated from FLC4 human hepatocarcinoma cells by expression cloning. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the encoded protein designated LAT3 (L-type amino acid transporter 3) transported neutral amino acids such as l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine. The LAT3-mediated transport was Na+-independent and inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, consistent with the properties of system L. Distinct from already known system L transporters LAT1 and LAT2, which form heterodimeric complex with 4F2 heavy chain, LAT3 was functional by itself in Xenopus oocytes. The deduced amino acid sequence of LAT3 was identical to the gene product of POV1 reported as a prostate cancer-up-regulated gene whose function was not determined, whereas it did not exhibit significant similarity to already identified transporters. The Eadie-Hofstee plots of LAT3-mediated transport were curvilinear, whereas the low affinity component is predominant at physiological plasma amino acid concentration. In addition to amino acid substrates, LAT3 recognized amino acid alcohols. The transport of l-leucine was electroneutral and mediated by a facilitated diffusion. In contrast, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol, which have a net positive charge induced inward currents under voltage clamp, suggesting these compounds are transported by LAT3. LAT3-mediated transport was inhibited by the pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the property of system L2 originally characterized in hepatocyte primary culture. Based on the substrate selectivity, affinity, and N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity, LAT3 is proposed to be a transporter subserving system L2. LAT3 should denote a new family of organic solute transporters.
transforming growth factor -	TGF-beta	DACH1 inhibits transforming growth factor-beta signaling through binding Smad4. The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling by interacting with NCoR and Smad4.
human interse	hIntersex	A mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional coactivator intersex is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex.
leucine - rich	LRR	The netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1 promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons. Netrin-G1 is a lipid-anchored protein that is structurally related to the netrin family of axon guidance molecules. Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.

transforming acidic coiled -	TACC	TACC1-chTOG-Aurora A protein complex in breast cancer. The three human TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil) genes encode a family of proteins with poorly defined functions that are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis. A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.

A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.

promyelocytic leukemia nuclear	PML-NBs	Viruses as hijackers of PML nuclear bodies. Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are discrete interchromosomal macromolecular structures. The integrity of this dynamic nuclear subcompartment critically depends on the presence of the name-giving PML protein. Among the permanent or transient residents of PML-NBs are various regulatory proteins, including Sp100, CBP, pRb, HIPK2, RAD51 and p53. PML-NBs are frequently targeted by viral infections, as a number of different RNA and DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papovaviruses, papillomaviruses and arenaviruses, cause changes in PML-NBs. Viruses interfere with PML-NB in two ways: 1) some viral proteins can associate with PML-NB proteins and/or lead to the destruction and lysis of this subnuclear compartment, thus aiding viral gene expression and disabling the host's innate immunity; 2) the parental genomes of some nuclear-replicating DNA viruses associate preferentially with PML-NBs, which presumably serves to assist in viral gene expression or replication. Here we feature the different viral strategies leading to the hijacking of PML-NBs and discuss the consequences for the immune response.
homeodomain - interacting protein kinase	HIPK2	US11 of herpes simplex virus type 1 interacts with HIPK2 and antagonizes HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase of the subfamily of dual-specificity Yak1-related kinase proteins. HIPK2 was first described as a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase acting as a corepressor for homeodomain transcription factors. More recently, it was reported that HIPK2 plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and could also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle. US11 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of several processes related to the survival of cells submitted to environmental stresses by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. In an attempt to better understand the multiple functions of US11, we identified cellular binding partners of this protein by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report that US11 interacts with HIPK2 through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and that this interaction occurs also in human cells. This interaction modifies the subcellular distribution of HIPK2 and protects the cell against the HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.
eukaryotic ribonuclease for mitochondrial rna	RNase MRP	Mutual interactions between subunits of the human RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein complex. The eukaryotic ribonuclease for mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) is mainly located in the nucleoli and belongs to the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. RNase MRP is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA and the generation of RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication. A closely related snoRNP, which shares protein subunits with RNase MRP and contains a structurally related RNA subunit, is the pre-tRNA processing factor RNase P. Up to now, 10 protein subunits of these complexes have been described, designated hPop1, hPop4, hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp30, Rpp38 and Rpp40. To get more insight into the assembly of the human RNase MRP complex we studied protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions by means of GST pull-down experiments. A total of 19 direct protein-protein and six direct protein-RNA interactions were observed. The analysis of mutant RNase MRP RNAs showed that distinct regions are involved in the direct interaction with protein subunits. The results provide insight into the way the protein and RNA subunits assemble into a ribonucleoprotein particle. Based upon these data a new model for the architecture of the human RNase MRP complex was generated.

x - linked ectodermal dysplasia	XEDAR	Induction of apoptosis by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor via a caspase 8-dependent mechanism. X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is highly expressed during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). In this report, we demonstrate that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless induces apoptosis in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. The apoptosis-inducing ability of XEDAR is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 and can be blocked by its genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. Although XEDAR-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and FADD small interfering RNA, XEDAR does not directly bind to FADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, or RIP1. Instead, XEDAR signaling leads to the formation of a secondary complex containing FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10, which results in caspase activation. Thus, XEDAR belongs to a novel class of death receptors that lack a discernible death domain but are capable of activating apoptosis in a caspase 8- and FADD-dependent fashion. XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolution of death receptors prior to the emergence of the death domain and may play a role in the induction of apoptosis during embryonic development and adult life.

with no lysine [ k	WNK	WNK1 phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 and modulates its membrane binding. WNK (with no lysine [K]) protein kinases were named for their unique active site organization. Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 cause a familial form of hypertension by undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that WNK1 selectively binds to and phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) within its calcium binding C2 domains. Endogenous WNK1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize on a subset of secretory granules in INS-1 cells. Phosphorylation by WNK1 increases the amount of Ca2+ required for Syt2 binding to phospholipid vesicles; mutation of threonine 202, a WNK1 phosphorylation site, partially prevents this change. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Syts by WNK1 can regulate Ca2+ sensing and the subsequent Ca2+-dependent interactions mediated by Syt C2 domains. These findings provide a biochemical mechanism that could lead to the retention or insertion of proteins in the plasma membrane. Interruption of this regulatory pathway may disturb membrane events that regulate ion balance.

analysis of protein - protein	PPIs	A protein interaction network links GIT1, an enhancer of huntingtin aggregation, to Huntington's disease. Analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a valuable approach for characterizing proteins of unknown function. Here, we have developed a strategy combining library and matrix yeast two-hybrid screens to generate a highly connected PPI network for Huntington's disease (HD). The network contains 186 PPIs among 35 bait and 51 prey proteins. It revealed 165 new potential interactions, 32 of which were confirmed by independent binding experiments. The network also permitted the functional annotation of 16 uncharacterized proteins and facilitated the discovery of GIT1, a G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein, which enhances huntingtin aggregation by recruitment of the protein into membranous vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence studies revealed that GIT1 and huntingtin associate in mammalian cells under physiological conditions. Moreover, GIT1 localizes to neuronal inclusions, and is selectively cleaved in HD brains, indicating that its distribution and function is altered during disease pathogenesis.

interleukin -	IL-1	A novel IL-1 receptor, cloned from B cells by mammalian expression, is expressed in many cell types. cDNA clones corresponding to an Mr approximately 80,000 receptor (type I receptor) for interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been isolated previously by mammalian expression. Here, we report the use of an improved expression cloning method to isolate human and murine cDNA clones encoding a second type (Mr approximately 60,000) of IL-1 receptor (type II receptor). The mature type II IL-1 receptor consists of (i) a ligand binding portion comprised of three immunoglobulin-like domains; (ii) a single transmembrane region; and (iii) a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. This last contrasts with the approximately 215 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor, and suggests that the two IL-1 receptors may interact with different signal transduction pathways. The type II receptor is expressed in a number of different tissues, including both B and T lymphocytes, and can be induced in several cell types by treatment with phorbol ester. Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. Like the type I receptor, the human type II IL-1 receptor can bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1ra). Vaccinia virus contains an open reading frame bearing strong resemblance to the type II IL-1 receptor.
major histocompatibility	MHC	Characterization of a novel gene in the human major histocompatibility complex that encodes a potential new member of the I kappa B family of proteins. At least 110 genes are now known to be located in the 4000 kb of DNA encompassing the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the chromosome band 6p21.3. Recent genomic sequence analysis of a 90 kb segment of DNA containing the tumour necrosis factor genes in the class III region of the MHC has predicted the presence of three potential exons mapping between the BAT1 and TNFB genes (12). A near full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene located between BAT1 and TNFB that contains sequence corresponding to one of these putative exons, has been isolated from a premonocytic leukaemic cell line cDNA library. Characterization of this gene reveals that it spans 13.5 kb of DNA, with the 3' end of the gene lying approximately 12 kb from the 5' end of the TNFB gene. The cDNA hybridizes to a approximately 1.6 kb mRNA in a number of different cell types, including monocytes, T cells, B cells and hepatocytes. The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is 381 amino acids in length, with a non-glycosylated M(r) of 43214. It contains one partial and two full ANK repeats, which bear a marked similarity to those in the I kappa B family of proteins, suggesting that the protein encoded by the novel gene could represent a divergent member of this family.
interleukin -	IL-1	Interleukin-1 type II receptor: a decoy target for IL-1 that is regulated by IL-4. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) interacts with cells through two types of binding molecules, IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1R I) and IL-1R II. The function of IL-1R II is unknown. In studies using monoclonal antibodies, IL-1 prolonged the in vitro survival of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) through IL-1R I, and IL-4 antagonized the action of IL-1 by inducing expression and release of IL-1R II. Dexamethasone also induced expression and release of the IL-1R II in PMN. These results, together with the effect of antibodies to IL-1R on IL-1-induced production of cytokines in monocytes, indicate that IL-1 acts on myelomonocytic cells through IL-1R I and that IL-1R II inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1. The existence of multiple pathways of regulation emphasizes the need for tight control of IL-1 action.

c2	tC2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for Humly9: the human homologue of mouse Ly9. Ly9 is a mouse cell membrane antigen found on all lymphocytes and coded for by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. We previously described the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA clone for mouse Ly9. Using cross-species hybridization we isolated cDNA clones encoding the human homologue Humly9. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that the extra-cellular portion of the Humly9 molecules is composed of four Ig-like domains: a V domain (V) without disulphide bonds and a truncated C2 domain (tC2) with two disulphide bonds, a second V domain without disulphide bonds and a second tC2 with two disulphide bonds, i.e., as V-tC2-V-tC2. The gene encoding Humly9 was mapped to chromosome 1 by analysis of human/hamster hybrids, and more specifically to the 1q22 region by in situ hybridization. The protein sequence data support the view that Humly9 belongs to the immunoglobulin-superfamily subgroup which includes CD48, CD2, and LFA-3.
smooth muscle	SMC	SM-20 is a novel 40-kd protein whose expression in the arterial wall is restricted to smooth muscle. We have previously reported the identification of a novel cDNA, SM-20, whose corresponding mRNA levels are regulated by growth factors in rat aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture. Affinity-purified polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were made against a 230 amino acid region of the SM-20 putative peptide expressed in the bacterial vector, pET-3b. Western blot analyses of rat and human SMC lysates detected a single protein species of approximately 40 kd. SM-20 was not detected in concentrates of the culture medium. By immunohistochemistry, SM-20 was localized to filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured SMC. Like SM-20 mRNA, levels of SM-20 protein were increased 1-3 hours after serum stimulation of rat aortic SMC. In rat tissues, SM-20 antigen was detected in abundance in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. SM-20 was also detected in some epithelial cells of the kidney, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, but was not found in the parenchyma of the liver, spleen, or testis. In the rat arterial wall, SM-20 antigen was restricted to the SMC of the media and, after balloon arterial injury, was found most abundantly in the neointima. In human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, SM-20 antigen predominated in the SMC of the intimal plaques and was not detected in macrophages, endothelium, or adventitial cells. Thus, SM-20 encodes a protein which serves as a novel SMC-specific marker within the vessel wall.
polymerase chain	PCR	Assignment of the PSST subunit gene of human mitochondrial complex I to chromosome 19p13. The cDNA for the PSST subunit of human mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH): ubiquinone oxidoreductase [complex I; NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), Fe-S (20 kDa); EC 1.6.5.3] was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human cDNA. The sequence of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA codes for a protein that is closely related to the bovine protein (93% homology). Nine conservative substitutions are found in the mature protein, mainly in the N and C terminal regions. The mature human protein is missing four amino acids (PAAL) close to the N terminus that are present in the bovine protein. The N terminus of the mature protein is preceded by a presequence of 38 amino acids that, although quite different from its bovine counterpart (52% homology), has properties that are characteristic of a mitochondrial import sequence. Southern hybridization analysis predicts an estimated gene size of 3.8 kb. Northern hybridization analysis of mRNA from fibroblasts of complex I-deficient patients revealed no size or transcript level abnormalities. The cDNA of the PSST protein was used to investigate tissue-specific expression and to localize the gene for this subunit to chromosome 19p13.
mannose - binding lect	MBL	cDNA cloning and primary structure analysis of C1qR(P), the human C1q/MBL/SPA receptor that mediates enhanced phagocytosis in vitro. The complement protein C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) are structurally similar molecules that enhance phagocytic function in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies R3 and R139, which inhibit the enhancement triggered by these three ligands, were used to purify a 126,000 M(r) cell surface protein designated C1qR(P). Amino acid sequence was obtained and the corresponding cDNA was cloned. C1qR(P) is a novel type I membrane protein with the following putative structural elements: a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, five EGF-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. All peptides identified by amino acid sequencing are encoded by the cDNA. Additionally, an anti-peptide antiserum was generated, which is reactive with C1qR(P). The data indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the receptor that plays a role in C1q/MBL/SPA-mediated removal or destruction of pathogens and immune complexes by phagocytosis.

hereditary hemochromato	HH	A 1.1-Mb transcript map of the hereditary hemochromatosis locus. In the process of positionally cloning a candidate gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), we constructed a 1.1-Mb transcript map of the region of human chromosome 6p that lies 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. A combination of three gene-finding techniques, direct cDNA selection, exon trapping, and sample sequencing, were used initially for a saturation screening of the 1.1-Mb region for expressed sequence fragments. As genetic analysis further narrowed the HH candidate locus, we sequenced completely 0.25 Mb of genomic DNA as a final measure to identify all genes. Besides the novel MHC class 1-like HH candidate gene HLA-H, we identified a family of five butyrophilin-related sequences, two genes with structural similarity to a type 1 sodium phosphate transporter, 12 novel histone genes, and a gene we named RoRet based on its strong similarity to the 52-kD Ro/SSA lupus and Sjogren's syndrome auto-antigen and the RET finger protein. Several members of the butyrophilin family and the RoRet gene share an exon of common evolutionary origin called B30-2. The B30-2 exon was originally isolated from the HLA class 1 region, yet has apparently " shuffled " into several genes along the chromosome telomeric to the MHC. The conservation of the B30-2 exon in several novel genes and the previously described amino acid homology of HLA-H to MHC class 1 molecules provide further support that this gene-rich region of 6p21.3 is related to the MHC. Finally, we performed an analysis of the four approaches for gene finding and conclude that direct selection provides the most effective probes for cDNA screening, and that as much as 30% of ESTs in this 1.1-Mb region may be derived from noncoding genomic DNA.
presenilin	PS1	Presenilin 1 interaction in the brain with a novel member of the Armadillo family. One approach to understanding the function of presenilin 1 (PS1), is to discover those proteins with which it interacts. Evidence for a function in developmental patterning came from C. elegans, in which a PS homologue was identified by screening for suppressors of a mutation in Notch/lin-12, a gene which specifies cell fate. However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with PS1. Therefore, we utilized the two hybrid system and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitations to identify a novel catenin, termed delta-catenin, which interacts with PS1 and is principally expressed in brain. The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with beta-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Dishevelled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.

The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with beta-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Dishevelled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.
thyroid hormone	TR	Isolation and characterization of a novel ligand-dependent thyroid hormone receptor-coactivating protein. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) regulates the expression of target genes upon binding to triiodothyronine (T3) response elements. In the presence of T3, the TR recruits coactivating proteins that both modulate and integrate the ligand response. We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the TR ligand-binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a cDNA sequence that encodes a protein of 920 amino acids with a size of 120 kDa (p120). Alignment with known sequences shows homology to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant protein. Interaction studies demonstrate that p120 interacts with the TR AF-2 domain in the presence of ligand through a 111-amino acid region. Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human tissues. Cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that p120 enhances TR-mediated transactivation on multiple T3 response elements in the presence of T3. In addition, CREB-binding protein synergizes with p120 to enhance this effect. When linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, p120 is an activator of transcription alone. Thus, p120 satisfies a number of important criteria as a nuclear receptor coactivator.
combined pituitary hormone	CPHD	Mutations in PROP1 cause familial combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH) and one or more of the other five anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the pituitary transcription factor gene POU1F1 (the human homologue of mouse Pit1) are responsible for deficiencies of GH, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in Snell and Jackson dwarf mice and in man, while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is preserved. The Ames dwarf (df) mouse displays a similar phenotype, and appears to be epistatic to Snell and Jackson dwarfism. We have recently positionally cloned the putative Ames dwarf gene Prop1, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is expressed specifically in embryonic pituitary and is necessary for Pit1 expression. In this report, we have identified four CPHD families with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for inactivating mutations of PROP1. These mutations in the human PROP1 gene result in a gene product with reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation ability in comparison to the product of the murine df mutation. In contrast to individuals with POU1F1 mutations, those with PROP1 mutations cannot produce LH and FSH at a sufficient level and do not enter puberty spontaneously. Our results identify a major cause of CPHD in humans and suggest a direct or indirect role for PROP1 in the ontogenesis of pituitary gonadotropes, as well as somatotropes, lactotropes and caudomedial thyrotropes.

t cell - specific adapter	TSAd	Molecular cloning of a T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd) containing an Src homology (SH) 2 domain and putative SH3 and phosphotyrosine binding sites. Adapter proteins link catalytic signaling proteins to cell surface receptors or downstream effector proteins. In this paper, we present the cDNA sequence F2771, isolated from an activated CD8+ T cell cDNA library. The F2771 cDNA encodes a novel putative adapter protein. The predicted amino acid sequence includes an SH2 domain as well as putative SH3 and phosphotyrosine binding interaction motifs, but lacks any known catalytic domains. The expression of the gene is limited to tissues of the immune system and, in particular, activated T cells. The protein expressed by F2771 cDNA in transfected COS cells is localized in the cytoplasm. A polyclonal antiserum raised against an F2771-encoded peptide reacts with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 52-kDa protein expressed in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The gene is localized to chromosome 1q21, a region often found to be aberrant in lymphomas. The T cell-specific expression and the rapid induction of mRNA expression upon receptor binding, as well as the lack of catalytic domains in the presence of protein interaction domains, indicate that the F2771 gene encodes a novel T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd) involved in the control of T cell activation.

g - protein - coupled	GPCRs	Discovery of three novel G-protein-coupled receptor genes. We report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of novel genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A search of a mouse database of expressed sequence tags revealed an EST partially encoding a GPCR, which was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the translational open reading frame (ORF). The resultant clone, GPR27, contained an intronless ORF, encoding a receptor of 379 amino acids. In an alternate strategy, human genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using degenerate oligonucleotides based on GPR1. Two PCR products partially encoding GPCRs were isolated and used to screen a genomic library to obtain the translational ORF. One of the resultant clones, GPR30, contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 375 amino acids. The other clone, GPR35, also contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 309 amino acids. Transcripts corresponding to GPR27 and GPR30 were detected in several areas of human and rat CNS, While GPR35 expression was detected only in the rat intestine. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis the gene encoding GPR30 was localized to chromosome 7p22 and GPR35 to chromosome 2q37.3.

uroplak	UPs	Uroplakin II gene is expressed in transitional cell carcinoma but not in bilharzial bladder squamous cell carcinoma: alternative pathways of bladder epithelial differentiation and tumor formation. Uroplakins (UPs) are integral membrane proteins that are synthesized as the major differentiation products of mammalian urothelium. We have cloned the human UP-II gene and localized it on chromosome 11q23. A survey of 50 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) revealed a UP-II polymorphism but no tumor-specific mutations. Immunohistochemical staining using rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide of UP-II and against total UPs showed UP reactivity in 39.5% (17 of 43 cases) of conventional TCCs, 12.8% (5 of 39) of bilharzial-related TCCs, and 2.7% (1 of 36) of bilharzial-related squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The finding that fewer bilharzial TCCs express UPs than conventional TCCs (12.8 versus 40%) raised the possibility that the former are heterogeneous, expressing SCC features to varying degrees. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that urothelium can undergo at least three pathways of differentiation: (a) urothelium-type pathway; (b) epidermis-type pathway; and (c) glandular-type pathway, characterized by the production of UPs, K1/K10 keratins, and secreted glycoproteins, respectively. Vitamin A deficiency and mesenchymal factors may play a role in determining the relative contributions of these pathways to urothelial differentiation as well as to the formation of TCC, SCC, and adenocarcinoma, or a mixture thereof.

mitochondrial	mtDNA	Human mitochondrial function during cardiac growth and development. Little information is presently available concerning mitochondrial respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation function in the normal human heart during growth and development. We investigated the levels of specific mitochondrial enzyme activities and content during cardiac growth and development from the early neonatal period (10-20 days) to adulthood (67 years). Biochemical analysis of enzyme specific activities and content and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was performed with left ventricular tissues derived from 30 control individuals. The levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and complex V specific activity, mtDNA copy number and COX subunit II content remained unchanged in contrast to increased citrate synthase (CS) activity and content. The developmental increase in CS activity paralleled increasing CS polypeptide content, but was neither related to overall increases in mitochondrial number nor coordinately regulated with mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. Our findings of unchanged levels of cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity during the progression from early childhood to older adult contrasts with the age-specific regulation found with CS, a Krebs cycle mitochondrial enzyme.

poly ( a ) - binding	PABP	Interaction of polyadenylate-binding protein with the eIF4G homologue PAIP enhances translation. In the initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA results from recognition of the 5' cap structure (m7GpppX) of the mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F is itself a three-subunit complex comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and eIF4G, which interacts with both eIF4A and eIF4E and enhances cap binding by eIF4E. The mRNA 3' polyadenylate tail and the associated poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) also regulate translational initiation, probably by interacting with the 5' end of the mRNA. In yeast and plants, PABP interacts with eIF4G but no such interaction has been reported in mammalian cells. Here, we describe a new human PABP-interacting protein, PAIP-I, whose sequence is similar to the central portion of eIF4G and which interacts with eIF4A. Overexpression of PAIP-1 in COS-7 cells stimulates translation, perhaps by providing a physical link between the mRNA termini.
apoptosis specific	ASP	Homology between a human apoptosis specific protein and the product of APG5, a gene involved in autophagy in yeast. Apoptosis specific proteins (ASP) are expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured mammalian cells of various lineages following induction of apoptosis. The cDNA encoding ASP has been cloned from a human expression library and has significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG5 gene which is essential for yeast autophagy. The ASP gene, known as hAPG5, can be transcribed to give mRNAs of 3.3 kbp, 2.5 kbp and 1.8 kbp which are present at comparable levels in viable and apoptotic cells, demonstrating that protein expression must be regulated at the translational level. These data indicate a possible relationship between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest evolutionary conservation in mammalian apoptosis of a degradative process present in yeast.
12r - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic	12R-HETE	A 12R-lipoxygenase in human skin: mechanistic evidence, molecular cloning, and expression. A recognized feature of psoriasis and other proliferative dermatoses is accumulation in the skin of the unusual arachidonic acid metabolite, 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE). This hydroxy fatty acid is opposite in chirality to the product of the well-known 12S-lipoxygenase and heretofore in mammals is known only as a product of cytochrome P450s. Here we provide mechanistic evidence for a lipoxygenase route to 12R-HETE in human psoriatic tissue and describe a 12R-lipoxygenase that can account for the biosynthesis. Initially we demonstrated retention of the C-12 deuterium of octadeuterated arachidonic acid in its conversion to 12R-HETE in incubations of psoriatic scales, indicating the end product is not formed by isomerization from 12S-H(P)ETE via the 12-keto derivative. Secondly, analysis of product formed from [10R-3H] and [10S-3H]-labeled arachidonic acids revealed that 12R-HETE synthesis is associated with stereospecific removal of the pro-R hydrogen from the 10-carbon of arachidonate. This result is compatible with 12R-lipoxygenase-catalyzed formation of 12R-HETE and not with a P450-catalyzed route to 12R-HETE in psoriatic scales. We cloned a lipoxygenase from human keratinocytes; the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences share < /=50% identity to other human lipoxygenases. This enzyme, when expressed in Hela cells, oxygenates arachidonic acid to 12-HPETE, >98% 12R in configuration. The 12R-lipoxygenase cDNA is detectable by PCR in psoriatic scales and as a 2.5-kilobase mRNA by Northern analysis of keratinocytes. Identification of this enzyme extends the known distribution of R-lipoxygenases to humans and presents an additional target for potential therapeutic interventions in psoriasis.
anterior segment mesenchymal dys	ASMD	A novel homeobox gene PITX3 is mutated in families with autosomal-dominant cataracts and ASMD. We report here the identification of a new human homeobox gene, PITX3, and its involvement in anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD) and congenital cataracts in humans. The PITX3 gene is the human homologue of the mouse Pitx3 gene and is a member of the RIEG/PITX homeobox gene family. The protein encoded by PITX3 shows 99% amino-acid identity to the mouse protein, with 100% identity in the homeodomain and approximately 70% overall identity to other members of this family. We mapped the human PITX3 gene to 10q25 using a radiation-hybrid panel. A collection of 80 DNA samples from individuals with various eye anomalies was screened for mutations in the PITX3 gene. We identified two mutations in independent patients. A 17-bp insertion in the 3'-end of the coding sequence, resulting in a frame shift, occurred in a patient with ASMD and cataracts, and a G-->A substitution, changing a codon for serine into a codon for asparagine, in the 5'-end of the gene occurred in a patient with congenital cataracts. Both mutations cosegregate with the disease phenotype in families, and neither were found in up to 300 control individuals studied. Further expression analysis of Pitx3 in the mouse supports a unique role in early ocular development, with later expression extending to the midbrain, tongue, incisors, sternum, vertebrae and limbs. These data strongly suggest a role for PITX3 in ASMD and cataracts and provide new evidence of the contribution of the RIEG/PITX gene family to the developmental program underpinning normal eye formation.
endoplasmic retic	ER	A stress response pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus requires a novel bifunctional protein kinase/endoribonuclease (Ire1p) in mammalian cells. Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP. We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast. The gene product hIre1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain that is highly conserved to the yeast counterpart having a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and a domain homologous to RNase L. However, the luminal domain has extensively diverged from the yeast gene product. hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p. Overexpressed hIre1p was localized to the ER with particular concentration around the nuclear envelope and some colocalization with the nuclear pore complex. Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. These results demonstrate that hIre1p is an essential proximal sensor of the unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.
dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrop	DRPLA	Atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, interacts with two families of WW domain-containing proteins. Atrophin-1 contains a polyglutamine repeat, expansion of which is responsible for dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The normal function of atrophin-1 is unknown. We have identified five atrophin-1 interacting proteins (AIPs) which bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity of the polyglutamine tract using the yeast two-hybrid system. Four of the interactions were confirmed using in vitro binding assays. All five interactors contained multiple WW domains. Two are novel. The AIPs can be divided into two distinct classes. AIP1 and AIP3/WWP3 are MAGUK-like multidomain proteins containing a number of protein-protein interaction modules, namely a guanylate kinase-like region, two WW domains, and multiple PDZ domains. AIP2/WWP2, AIP4, and AIP5/WWP1 are highly homologous, each having four WW domains and a HECT domain characteristic of ubiquitin ligases. These interactors are similar to recently isolated huntingtin-interacting proteins, suggesting possible commonality of function between two proteins responsible for very similar diseases.

iron sulphur	IP	cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of the remaining three human nuclear encoded iron sulphur protein (IP) subunits of complex I: the human IP fraction is completed. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented in a flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP) subfraction. The IP subfraction is hypothesized to be significant, since it contains important prosthetic groups highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits. All presented cDNAs include the complete open reading frame (ORF), which consist of 1392, 795, and 375 base pairs, coding for 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter show 96, 90, and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from somatic human-rodent cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template gave a human-specific signal which mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit a pseudogene may be present since signals were seen in the lanes containing chromosomes 5 and 6. The NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which make them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzymatic complex I-deficient patients.

von willebrand	vWF	A novel human actin-binding protein homologue that binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha. Glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V is one of the major transmembrane complexes present on the platelet surface. Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the protein shared a high degree of homology with human endothelial ABP-280 (70% identity) and chicken filamin (83% identity). However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing. ABP-276 and/or ABP-278 were present in all tissues examined, but the relative amount varied in that some tissue contained both forms, while other tissue contained predominately one or the other.

kruppel - type zinc	ZNF	ZK1, a novel Krüppel-type zinc finger gene, is induced following exposure to ionizing radiation and enhances apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells. To identify and early response factor by exposure to ionizing radiation, we cloned the cDNA of a novel Krüppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) gene, ZK1, from a cDNA library constructed from the human leukemia cell line, CMK86, using degenerate primers. This cDNA encoded a protein of 671 amino acids with an A box of Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at the N-terminus, followed by 15 ZNF motifs. The expression level of the ZK1 mRNA in human leukemia cells lines, CMK86 and U937, was increased after exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, murine myeloid precursor 32D cells that were stably transfected with ZK1 cDNA had higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation than the 32D parent cells. These data suggest that the ZK1 gene is one of early response genes by exposure to ionizing radiation, and may have some functions on radiation-induced apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.

homeodomain - interacting protein kinase	HIPKs	Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases, a novel family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors. A novel family of cofactors that differentially interact with homeoproteins have been identified via a yeast two-hybrid screen. The proteins contain a conserved protein kinase domain that is separated from a domain that interacts with homeoproteins and hence are termed homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs): HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3. We show that HIPKs are nuclear kinases using GFP-HIPK fusion constructs. The DNA binding activity of the NK-3 homeoprotein is greatly enhanced by HIPK2, but this effect is independent of its phosphorylation by HIPK2. In cultured cells, HIPKs localize to nuclear speckles and potentiate the repressor activities of NK homeoproteins. The co-repressor activity of HIPKs depends on both its homeodomain interaction domain and a co-repressor domain that maps to the N terminus. Thus, HIPKs represent a heretofore undescribed family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors.
enhancer	ENII	Cloning and characterization of a novel human hepatocyte transcription factor, hB1F, which binds and activates enhancer II of hepatitis B virus. Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.

olfactory	OR	Organization and evolution of olfactory receptor genes on human chromosome 11. Olfactory receptors (OR) are encoded by a large multigene family including hundreds of members dispersed throughout the human genome. Cloning and mapping studies have determined that a large proportion of the olfactory receptor genes are located on human chromosomes 6, 11, and 17, as well as distributed on other chromosomes. In this paper, we describe and characterize the organization of olfactory receptor genes on human chromosome 11 by using degenerate PCR-based probes to screen chromosome 11-specific and whole genome clone libraries for members of the OR gene family. OR genes were identified by DNA sequencing and then localized to regions of chromosome 11. Physical maps of several gene clusters were constructed to determine the chromosomal relationships between various members of the family. This work identified 25 new OR genes located on chromosome 11 in at least seven distinct regions. Three of these regions contain gene clusters that include additional members of this gene family not yet identified by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the newly described OR genes suggests a mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity.
viral bcl - 2 homo	vBcl-2	Diva, a Bcl-2 homologue that binds directly to Apaf-1 and induces BH3-independent cell death. We have identified and characterized Diva, which is a novel regulator of apoptosis. Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.
transmembrane protein involved in cell - fate	Notch	CIR, a corepressor linking the DNA binding factor CBF1 to the histone deacetylase complex. CBF1 is a member of the CSL family of DNA binding factors, which mediate either transcriptional repression or transcriptional activation. CSL proteins play a central role in Notch signaling and in Epstein-Barr virus-induced immortalization. Notch is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-fate decisions, and the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NotchIC) targets CBF1. The Epstein-Barr virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral gene expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking NotchIC. We have examined the mechanism of CBF1-mediated repression and show that CBF1 binds to a unique corepressor, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR). A CIR homolog is encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that CIR is evolutionarily conserved. Two CBF1 mutants that were unable to bind CIR did not function as repressors, suggesting that targeting of CIR to CBF1 is an important component of repression. When expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, CIR repressed reporter gene expression. CIR binds to histone deacetylase and to SAP30 and serves as a linker between CBF1 and the histone deacetylase complex.

c1q - related	CRF	Cloning and characterization of CRF, a novel C1q-related factor, expressed in areas of the brain involved in motor function. We have isolated and characterized a novel cDNA, C1q-Related Factor (CRF), that is predicted to encode a 258 amino acid polypeptide with a hydrophobic signal sequence, a collagenous region, and a globular domain at the carboxy terminus that shares homology to the C1q signature domain. Human CRF transcript is expressed at highest levels in the brain, particularly in the brainstem. In situ hybridization to mouse brain sections demonstrated that CRF transcripts are most abundant in areas of the nervous system involved in motor function, such as the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the accessory olivary nucleus, the pons and the red nucleus. The mouse CRF homolog is highly similar to the human gene at both the nucleotide and protein level, suggesting an important conserved role for this protein.
gamma - aminobutyric	GABA	GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein links GABA(A) receptors and the cytoskeleton. Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin. Here we identify a new cellular protein, GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which can interact with the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. GABARAP binds to GABA(A) receptors both in vitro and in vivo, and co-localizes with the punctate staining of GABA(A) receptors on cultured cortical neurons. Sequence analysis shows similarity between GABARAP and light chain-3 of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B. Moreover, the N terminus of GABARAP is highly positively charged and features a putative tubulin-binding motif. The interactions among GABA(A) receptors, GABARAP and tubulin suggest a mechanism for the targeting and clustering of GABA(A) receptors.
gaba ( a ) - receptor - associated	GABARAP	GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein links GABA(A) receptors and the cytoskeleton. Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin. Here we identify a new cellular protein, GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which can interact with the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors.

rat sialomucin	SMC	Complete sequence of the human mucin MUC4: a putative cell membrane-associated mucin. The MUC4 gene, which encodes a human epithelial mucin, is expressed in various epithelial tissues, just as well in adult as in poorly differentiated cells in the embryo and fetus. Its N-terminus and central sequences have previously been reported as comprising a 27-residue peptide signal, followed by a large domain varying in length from 3285 to 7285 amino acid residues. The present study establishes the whole coding sequence of MUC4 in which the C-terminus is 1156 amino acid residues long and shares a high degree of similarity with the rat sialomucin complex (SMC). SMC is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex composed of mucin (ascites sialoglycoprotein 1, ASGP-1) and transmembrane (ASGP-2) subunits. The same organization is found in MUC4, where the presence of a GlyAspProHis proteolytic site may cleave the large precursor into two subunits, MUC4alpha and MUC4beta. Like ASGP-2, which binds the receptor tyrosine kinase p185(neu), MUC4beta possesses two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a transmembrane sequence and a potential phosphorylated site. MUC4, the human homologue of rat SMC, may be a heterodimeric bifunctional cell-surface glycoprotein of 2.12 micrometers. These results confer a new biological role for MUC4 as a ligand for ErbB2 in cell signalling.
hermansky - pudlak	HPS	Altered trafficking of lysosomal proteins in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome due to mutations in the beta 3A subunit of the AP-3 adaptor. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetic disorder characterized by defective lysosome-related organelles. Here, we report the identification of two HPS patients with mutations in the beta 3A subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-3 complex. The patients' fibroblasts exhibit drastically reduced levels of AP-3 due to enhanced degradation of mutant beta 3A. The AP-3 deficiency results in increased surface expression of the lysosomal membrane proteins CD63, lamp-1, and lamp-2, but not of nonlysosomal proteins. These differential effects are consistent with the preferential interaction of the AP-3 mu 3A subunit with tyrosine-based signals involved in lysosomal targeting. Our results suggest that AP-3 functions in protein sorting to lysosomes and provide an example of a human disease in which altered trafficking of integral membrane proteins is due to mutations in a component of the sorting machinery.
histone acetyltransferas	HAT	Regulation of histone acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF by the bHLH protein twist and adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) play a critical role in transcriptional control by relieving repressive effects of chromatin, and yet how HATs themselves are regulated remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown that Twist directly binds two independent HAT domains of acetyltransferases, p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and directly regulates their HAT activities. The N terminus of Twist is a primary domain interacting with both acetyltransferases, and the same domain is required for inhibition of p300-dependent transcription by Twist. Adenovirus E1A protein mimics the effects of Twist by inhibiting the HAT activities of p300 and PCAF. These findings establish a cogent argument for considering the HAT domains as a direct target for acetyltransferase regulation by both a cellular transcription factor and a viral oncoprotein.

uncoupling	UCPs	UCP4, a novel brain-specific mitochondrial protein that reduces membrane potential in mammalian cells. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of mitochondrial transporter proteins that have been implicated in thermoregulatory heat production and maintenance of the basal metabolic rate. We have identified and partially characterized a novel member of the human uncoupling protein family, termed uncoupling protein-4 (UCP4). Protein sequence analyses showed that UCP4 is most related to UCP3 and possesses features characteristic of mitochondrial transporter proteins. Unlike other known UCPs, UCP4 transcripts are exclusively expressed in both fetal and adult brain tissues. UCP4 maps to human chromosome 6p11.2-q12. Consistent with its potential role as an uncoupling protein, UCP4 is localized to the mitochondria and its ectopic expression in mammalian cells reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that UCP4 may be involved in thermoregulatory heat production and metabolism in the brain.

angiopoie	Ang	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel angiopoietin family protein, angiopoietin-3. Using homology-based PCR, we have isolated cDNA encoding a novel member (491 amino acids) of the angiopoietin (Ang) family from human adult heart cDNA and have designated it angiopoietin-3 (Ang3). The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of Ang-3 contain the characteristic coiled-coil domain and fibrinogen-like domain that are conserved in other known Angs. Ang3 has a highly hydrophobic region at the N-terminus (approximately 21 amino acids) that is typical of a signal sequence for protein secretion. Ang3 mRNA is most abundant in adrenal gland, placenta, thyroid gland, heart and small intestine in human adult tissues. Additionally, Ang3 is a secretory protein, but is not a mitogen in endothelial cells.

pp2	PP2A	Purification and identification of a novel subunit of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4. The catalytic subunit of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4 (PP4C) has greater than 65% amino acid identity to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2AC). Despite this high homology, PP4 does not appear to associate with known PP2A regulatory subunits. As a first step toward characterization of PP4 holoenzymes and identification of putative PP4 regulatory subunits, PP4 was purified from bovine testis soluble extracts. PP4 existed in two complexes of approximately 270-300 and 400-450 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The smaller PP4 complex was purified by sequential phenyl-Sepharose, Source 15Q, DEAE2, and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatographies. The final product contained two major proteins: the PP4 catalytic subunit plus a protein that migrated as a doublet of 120-125 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The associated protein, termed PP4R1, and PP4C also bound to microcystin-Sepharose. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified complex revealed two major peaks, at 35 (PP4C) and 105 kDa (PP4R1). Amino acid sequence information of several peptides derived from the 105 kDa protein was utilized to isolate a human cDNA clone. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed 13 nonidentical repeats similar to repeats found in the A subunit of PP2A (PP2AA). The PP4R1 cDNA clone engineered with an N-terminal Myc tag was expressed in COS M6 cells and PP4C co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged PP4R1. These data indicate that one form of PP4 is similar to the core complex of PP2A in that it consists of a catalytic subunit and a " PP2AA-like " structural subunit.
geranylgeranyl diphos	GGPP	Human geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase. cDNA cloning and expression. Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase (GGPPSase) catalyzes the synthesis of GGPP, which is an important molecule responsible for the C20-prenylated protein biosynthesis and for the regulation of a nuclear hormone receptor (LXR.RXR). The human GGPPSase cDNA encodes a protein of 300 amino acids which shows 16% sequence identity with the known human farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (FPPSase). The GGPPSase expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzes the GGPP formation (240 nmol/min/mg) from FPP and isopentenyl diphosphate. The human GGPPSase behaves as an oligomeric molecule with 280 kDa on a gel filtration column and cross-reacts with an antibody directed against bovine brain GGPPSase, which differs immunochemically from bovine brain FPPSase. Northern blot analysis indicates the presence of two forms of the mRNA.

formiminotransferase cyclodeamina	FTCD	Formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase is an organ-specific autoantigen recognized by sera of patients with autoimmune hepatitis. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anti-liver cytosol type 1 autoantibodies have been reported in association with anti-liver-kidney microsome type 1 autoantibodies in 30% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis type II. In 10% of cases, anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibodies are the only liver-related circulating autoantibodies. The liver cytosol antigen is a liver-specific 62-kilodalton protein present in the cell as an oligomer of approximately 240 kilodaltons. The aim of this study was to identify the antigen recognized by anti-liver cytosol antibody. METHODS: To identify the liver cytosol antigen, an anti-liver cytosol type 1-positive serum was used for the screening of a complementary DNA library from HepG2 cells. Double immunodiffusion method was used to show the identity between the cytosolic and the cloned protein. RESULTS: The sequence of two isolated clones showed 85.2% homology with the formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD) enzyme from pig liver. Antibodies purified by affinity with the recombinant protein and sera from mice immunized with FTCD recognized a 62-kilodalton human cytosolic protein when tested by immunoblot. The identity of precipitation lines was found between the cytosolic antigen and FTCD. CONCLUSIONS: This enzyme is a liver-specific antigen recognized by the sera of patients with autoimmune hepatitis.
maf recognition	MARE	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a new Cap'n' collar family transcription factor Nrf3. The NF-E2-binding sites or Maf recognition elements (MARE) are essential cis-acting elements in the regulatory regions of erythroid-specific genes recognized by the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2, composed of p45 and MafK. Recently, two p45-related factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 were isolated, and they are now collectively grouped as the Cap'n' collar (CNC) family. CNC factors bind to MARE through heterodimer formation with small Maf proteins. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel CNC factor, Nrf3, encoding a predicted 73-kDa protein with a basic region-leucine zipper domain highly homologous to those of other CNC proteins. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that Nrf3 can heterodimerize with MafK and that this complex binds to the MARE in the chicken beta-globin enhancer and can activate transcription. Nrf3 mRNA is highly expressed in human placenta and B cell and monocyte lineage. Chromosomal localization of human Nrf3 is 7p14-15, which lies near the hoxA gene locus. As the genetic loci of p45, nrf1, and nrf2 have been mapped close to those of hoxC, hoxB, and hoxD, respectively, the present study strongly argues for the idea that a single ancestral gene for the CNC family members may have been localized near the ancestral Hox cluster and have diverged to give rise to four closely related CNC factors through chromosome duplication.

cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain	DNCI1	Cloning and characterization of two cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain genes in mouse and human. Cytoplasmic dynein is a large multisubunit microtubule-based motor protein, which mediates movement of numerous intracellular organelles. We report here the identification of the human homologue of cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain 1 gene (DNCI1) located on human chromosome 7q21.3-q22.1. The mouse orthologue (Dnci1) was identified along with another highly related gene, Dnci2, and their RNA in situ expression patterns were examined during mouse embryogenesis. Dnci1 was found to have a highly restricted expression domain in the developing forebrain as well as the peripheral nervous system (PNS), while Dnci2 displayed a broad expression profile throughout the entire central nervous system and most of the PNS. A dynamic expression profile was also found for Dnci2 in the developing mouse limb bud. The data presented here provide a framework for the further analysis of the functional role of Dnci1 and Dnci2 in mouse and DNCI1 in human.

retinoic acid - induced	RAI2	Identification and characterization of the human homologue (RAI2) of a mouse retinoic acid-induced gene in Xp22. We have identified a novel human gene during studies of a 1.3-Mb region of Xp22 between DXS418 and DXS999. A PAC contig spanning the region was constructed, sequenced, and analyzed by gene and exon prediction programs and by homology searches. Further investigation of predicted exons from PAC clone 389A20 led to the identification of a single-exon gene, designated RAI2 (retinoic acid-induced 2). RAI2 mapped 28 kb centromeric to marker DXS7996, between DXS7996 and DXS7997, and was transcribed from centromere to telomere. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in four fetal tissues (brain, lung, kidney, and heart) and eight adult tissues (heart, brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and retina) but not in fetal or adult liver. The 530-amino-acid protein (57 kDa predicted mass) displays 94% homology with a mouse retinoic acid-induced gene product and contains a novel proline-rich (39%) domain of 68 amino acids. Retinoic acid is involved in vertebrate anteroposterior axis formation and cellular differentiation and has been shown to modulate gene expression controlling early embryonal development, suggesting a developmental role for RAI2. RAI2 remains a candidate gene for diseases mapping to the Xp22 region.
low - density lipoprotein	LDLR	Molecular cloning of mouse Lrp7(Lr3) cDNA and chromosomal mapping of orthologous genes in mouse and human. LRP7 (the HGMW-approved gene symbol for LR3) is a novel member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. The unique modular features in both its extracellular and its intracellular regions and functional analysis suggest it to be a multifunctional protein with mitogenic activity and potential ligand-induced signal transduction capability. We describe here the cloning of Lrp7, the orthologue of the human LRP7 gene, from a mouse liver cDNA library and its expression profile in mouse tissues and developmental stages. Lrp7 is highly homologous to the human sequence, with 95% identity at the amino acid level and a perfect conservation of all the recognizable functional domains. A 6-kb mRNA transcript could be detected in all the tissues examined, with the highest expression levels in liver, heart, and lung and the lowest levels in brain and spleen. A similar expression level of a smaller transcript (4.5 kb) was seen at the four embryonic stages examined. We mapped the Lrp 7 gene to mouse chromosome 19B and the LRP7 gene to human chromosome 11q13.4. The LRP7 gene was also localized by radiation hybrid mapping between markers D11S24270 and D11S1975.
p - aminohippura	PAH	Molecular cloning and characterization of two novel human renal organic anion transporters (hOAT1 and hOAT3). The cloned organic anion transporters from rat, mouse, and winter flounder (rOAT1, mOAT1, fROAT) mediate the coupled exchange of alpha-ketoglutarate with multiple organic anions, including p-aminohippurate (PAH). We have isolated two novel gene products from human kidney which bear significant homology to the known OATs and belong to the amphiphilic solute facilitator (ASF) family. The cDNAs, hOAT1 and hOAT3, encode for 550- and 568-amino-acid residue proteins, respectively. hOAT1 and hOAT3 mRNAs are expressed strongly in kidney and weakly in brain. Both genes map to chromosome 11 region q11.7. PAH uptake by Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with hOAT1 mRNA is increased 100-fold compared to water-injected oocytes. PAH uptake is chloride dependent and is not further increased by preincubation of oocytes in 5 mM glutarate. Uptake of PAH is inhibited by probenicid, alpha-ketoglutarate, bumetanide, furosemide, and losartan, but not by salicylate, urate, choline, amilioride, and hydrochlorothiazide.

alzheimer ' s beta - amyloid precursor	APP	X11L2, a new member of the X11 protein family, interacts with Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein. We screened proteins for interaction with Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and cloned a new member of the X11 protein family, X11L2. The PID/PTB element of X11L2 protein interacted with the intracellular domain of APP by GST binding assay, and in vivo interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts overexpressing APP and HA-tagged X11L2. This gene encoded 575 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous to rat Mint3. Three protein-protein interaction domains, a PID/PTB and two PDZ elements, were conserved among the X11 protein family, and the N-terminal region of X11L2 protein had several putative SH3 binding motifs, PXXP. Unlike other members of the X11 protein family, X11L2 mRNA was expressed in various tissues.
expressed sequenced	ESTs	An antisense transcript to SMAD5 expressed in fetal and tumor tissues. SMAD5, a transducer of TGF-beta/BMP inhibitory signals and a tumor suppressor candidate, localizes to the region of invariant loss in human myeloid neoplasms, on chromosome 5q31.1. Recent evidence indicates a gene-dosage effect along the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways. We have identified a novel transcript designated DAMS, whose 3' exonic sequences contain in part an alternate 5' exon of SMAD5, in the antisense orientation. Expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) for DAMS are found in fetal tissues (heart, adrenal glands, and total fetus) and pancreatic tumor cDNA libraries. In contrast to SMAD5, DAMS expression is not readily detectable in adult and fetal tissues. Semiquantitative PCR suggests that the stoichiometry between SMAD5 and DAMS transcripts ranges between 15 and 120 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. The findings raise the possibility that DAMS may be a fail-safe mechanism for precise regulation of SMAD5 transcript levels that may be critical in maintaining normal homeostasis.
phenylalanyl - trna syntheta	PheRS	Human phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase: cloning, characterization of the deduced amino acid sequences in terms of the structural domains and coordinately regulated expression of the alpha and beta subunits in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Unlike the catalytic alpha-subunit, the beta-subunit of heterodimeric (alphabeta)2 phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) has no invariant functional amino acids directly involved in the aminoacylation process as it is evident from the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus enzyme complexed with tRNAPhe. Having no catalytic function, the prokaryotic beta-subunit comprises OB-, RNP-, SH3-, and DNA-binding-like domains involved in a variety of biological functions in other proteins. It was shown that the mRNA of the human alpha-subunit overexpressed in the tumorigenic versus the nontumorigenic variant of the same acute-phase chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (CML). We cloned, sequenced, and expressed human PheRS. The layout of the human sequence indicates that the general tRNA binding mode and anticodon recognition differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes for the phenylalanine system. Northern blot hybridization analysis from malignant and normal human tissues enabled us to assess the relative expression levels of the alpha- and beta-subunits independently, in view of the additional cellular role proposed for the beta-subunit in tumorigenic events. The levels of mRNA corresponding to the alpha- and beta-subunits were remarkably similar in all cell types and tissues examined, thus indicating the implication of the entire (alphabeta)2 heterodimer in tumorigenic events.

stem cell	SCF	Parathyroid hormone-regulated production of stem cell factor in human osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells. We investigated stem cell factor (SCF) expression in osteoblasts because mast cells, which occur ectopically in hyperparathyroid bone, are induced by SCF. Nontransformed osteoblasts and Saos2 or MG63 cells expressed SCF in response to PTH. Western analysis showed only large, cell-associated isoforms, Mrs approximately 40-48 kD. Transfection of MG63 cells with plasmids expressing antisense SCF mRNA eliminated immunoreactive SCF. Sequencing osteoblast SCF cDNAs showed that exon 6 was omitted. mRNAs without exon 6 produce membrane-associated SCF isoforms in rodents, suggesting that human SCFs are processed similarly. The major osteoblastic SCF mRNA, approximately 5 kB, was augmented by PTH. Neither protein or mRNA was increased by vitamin D, however, 6-7 kB transcripts were predominant in other tissues but not detectable in osteoblasts. We conclude that osteoblasts express SCF in response to PTH, with mRNA and protein processing differences relative to other cells. SCF stimulates osteoclasts, suggesting that PTH-induced osteoblastic SCF functions to accelerate bone turnover. Mast cells may occur due to SCF overexpression at extreme PTH levels.
natural	NK	NKp44, a triggering receptor involved in tumor cell lysis by activated human natural killer cells, is a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Surface receptors involved in natural killer (NK) cell triggering during the process of tumor cell lysis have recently been identified. Of these receptors, NKp44 is selectively expressed by IL-2- activated NK cells and may contribute to the increased efficiency of activated NK cells to mediate tumor cell lysis. Here we describe the molecular cloning of NKp44. Analysis of the cloned cDNA indicated that NKp44 is a novel transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the Immunoglobulin superfamily characterized by a single extracellular V-type domain. The charged amino acid lysine in the transmembrane region may be involved in the association of NKp44 with the signal transducing molecule killer activating receptor-associated polypeptide (KARAP)/DAP12. These molecules were found to be crucial for the surface expression of NKp44. In agreement with data of NKp44 surface expression, the NKp44 transcripts were strictly confined to activated NK cells and to a minor subset of TCR-gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes. Unlike genes coding for other receptors involved in NK cell triggering or inhibition, the NKp44 gene is on human chromosome 6.

Here we describe the molecular cloning of NKp44. Analysis of the cloned cDNA indicated that NKp44 is a novel transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the Immunoglobulin superfamily characterized by a single extracellular V-type domain. The charged amino acid lysine in the transmembrane region may be involved in the association of NKp44 with the signal transducing molecule killer activating receptor-associated polypeptide (KARAP)/DAP12. These molecules were found to be crucial for the surface expression of NKp44. In agreement with data of NKp44 surface expression, the NKp44 transcripts were strictly confined to activated NK cells and to a minor subset of TCR-gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes. Unlike genes coding for other receptors involved in NK cell triggering or inhibition, the NKp44 gene is on human chromosome 6.
human	Chr	PHF2, a novel PHD finger gene located on human chromosome 9q22. We have isolated and characterized a novel PHD finger gene, PHF2, which maps to human Chromosome (Chr) 9q22 close to D9S196. Its mouse homolog was also characterized and mapped to the syntenic region on mouse Chr 13. The predicted human and mouse proteins are 98% identical and contain a PHD finger domain, eight possible nuclear localization signals, two potential PEST sequences, and a novel conserved hydrophobic domain. Northern analysis shows widespread expression of PHF2 in adult tissues, while in situ hybridization on mouse embryos reveals staining in the neural tube and dorsal root ganglia significantly above a ubiquitous low level expression signal. From its expression pattern and its chromosomal localization, PHF2 is a candidate gene for hereditary sensory neuropathy type I, HSN1.
bone morphogenetic	BMPs	Chromosomal localization of three human genes encoding bone morphogenetic protein receptors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-beta superfamily that play a pivotal role in bone formation during embryogenesis and fracture repair. BMP signaling occurs via hetero-oligomeric serine/threonine kinase complexes of BMP type I (BMPR-IA or BMPR-IB) and type II receptors (BMPR-II). BMPR-IA and IB are closely related receptors, with sequence differences conserved between different species, suggesting that they serve distinct functions. Here we report the cDNA cloning of human BMPR1B and the chromosomal localization of all three BMPR genes. Using somatic cell hybrid and FISH analyses, the BMPR1A, BMPR1B, and BMPR2 genes were assigned to 10q23, 4q22-24, and 2q33-34, respectively. A processed BMPR1A pseudogene was mapped to 6q23.
None	ERKs	Regulation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by G-protein-linked muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, or stress-activated protein kinases) are activated by diverse extracellular signals and mediate a variety of cellular responses, including mitogenesis, differentiation, hypertrophy, inflammatory reactions and apoptosis. We have examined the involvement of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) in ERK and JNK activation by the human G-protein-coupled m2 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We show that the Ca2+-mobilizing m3 AChR is efficiently coupled to JNK and ERK activation, whereas the m2 AChR activates ERK but not JNK. Activation of JNK in CHO-m3 cells by the agonist methacholine (MCh) was delayed in onset and more sustained relative to that of ERK in either CHO-m2 or CHO-m3 cells. The EC50 values for MCh-induced ERK activation in both cell types were essentially identical and similar to that for JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells, suggesting little amplification of the response. Agonist-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation in CHO-m3 cells was insensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), consistent with a Gq/phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-beta mediated pathway, whereas a significant component of ERK and JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells was PTX-sensitive, indicating Gi/o involvement. Using manipulations that prevent receptor-mediated extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+-store release, we also show that ERK activation by m2 and m3 receptors is Ca2+-independent. In contrast, a significant component (>50%) of JNK activation mediated by the m3 AChR was dependent on Ca2+, mainly derived from extracellular influx. PKC inhibition and down-regulation studies suggested that JNK activation was negatively regulated by PKC. Conversely, ERK activation by both m2 and m3 AChRs required PKC, suggesting a novel mechanism for PKC activation by PTX-sensitive m2 AChRs. In summary, mAChRs activate JNK and ERK via divergent mechanisms involving either Ca2+ or PKC respectively.

a2a adenosine	A2AR	Patterns of A2A extracellular adenosine receptor expression in different functional subsets of human peripheral T cells. Flow cytometry studies with anti-A2A receptor monoclonal antibodies. Signaling through A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR) regulates T lymphocyte expansion and modulates T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated effector functions in vitro. To understand the role of A2ARs in the regulation of immune response, we investigated the expression levels of this receptor in different functional lymphocyte subsets. Monoclonal anti-A2AR antibody was used to develop a flow cytometric assay to quantify the expression A2ARs on lymphocytes. We report that detectable levels of expression of A2ARs are much higher among T cells than B cells. More CD4(+) than CD8(+) T cells express A2ARs, but activation of T cells increases A2AR expression, predominantly in CD8(+) T cells. No significant differences were found in the proportion of A2AR+ cells between CD8(low) and CD8(high) T cells or between TCR/CD3(low) and TCR/CD3(high) T cells. Studies of T helper cell subsets (TH1 and TH2) reveal that lymphokine-producing cells are much more likely to express A2ARs than are cells that do not produce lymphokines. These results suggest that A2ARs are variably expressed on T cell subsets and may regulate cytokine production in activated T lymphocytes.

complementation	CGs	Human PEX19: cDNA cloning by functional complementation, mutation analysis in a patient with Zellweger syndrome, and potential role in peroxisomal membrane assembly. At least 11 complementation groups (CGs) have been identified for the peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) such as Zellweger syndrome, for which seven pathogenic genes have been elucidated. We have isolated a human PEX19 cDNA (HsPEX19) by functional complementation of peroxisome deficiency of a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, ZP119, defective in import of both matrix and membrane proteins. This cDNA encodes a hydrophilic protein (Pex19p) comprising 299 amino acids, with a prenylation motif, CAAX box, at the C terminus. Farnesylated Pex19p is partly, if not all, anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, exposing its N-terminal part to the cytosol. A stable transformant of ZP119 with HsPEX19 was morphologically and biochemically restored for peroxisome biogenesis. HsPEX19 expression also restored peroxisomal protein import in fibroblasts from a patient (PBDJ-01) with Zellweger syndrome of CG-J. This patient (PBDJ-01) possessed a homozygous, inactivating mutation: a 1-base insertion, A764, in a codon for Met255, resulted in a frameshift, inducing a 24-aa sequence entirely distinct from normal Pex19p. These results demonstrate that PEX19 is the causative gene for CG-J PBD and suggest that the C-terminal part, including the CAAX homology box, is required for the biological function of Pex19p. Moreover, Pex19p is apparently involved at the initial stage in peroxisome membrane assembly, before the import of matrix protein.

sodium / myo - inositol cotransport	SMIT	Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein, a rel-like protein that stimulates transcription in response to hypertonicity. Hypertonicity (most often present as high salinity) is stressful to the cells of virtually all organisms. Cells survive in a hypertonic environment by increasing the transcription of genes whose products catalyze cellular accumulation of compatible osmolytes. In mammals, the kidney medulla is normally hypertonic because of the urinary concentrating mechanism. Cellular accumulation of compatible osmolytes in the renal medulla is catalyzed by the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT), the sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter, and aldose reductase (synthesis of sorbitol). The importance of compatible osmolytes is underscored by the necrotic injury of the renal medulla and subsequent renal failure that results from the inhibition of SMIT in vivo by administration of a specific inhibitor. Tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonE) play a key role in hypertonicity-induced transcriptional stimulation of SMIT, sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter, and aldose reductase. We report the cDNA cloning of human TonE binding protein (TonEBP), a transcription factor that stimulates transcription through its binding to TonE sequences via a Rel-like DNA binding domain. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of cells cultured in hypertonic medium reveal that exposure to hypertonicity elicits slow activation of TonEBP, which is the result of an increase in TonEBP amount and translocation to the nucleus.

green fluorescent	GFP	CLIP-170 highlights growing microtubule ends in vivo. A chimera with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been constructed to visualize the dynamic properties of the endosome-microtubule linker protein CLIP170 (GFP-CLIP170). GFP-CLIP170 binds in stretches along a subset of microtubule ends. These fluorescent stretches appear to move with the growing tips of microtubules at 0.15-0.4 microm/s, comparable to microtubule elongation in vivo. Analysis of speckles along dynamic GFP-CLIP170 stretches suggests that CLIP170 treadmills on growing microtubule ends, rather than being continuously transported toward these ends. Drugs affecting microtubule dynamics rapidly inhibit movement of GFP-CLIP170 dashes. We propose that GFP-CLIP170 highlights growing microtubule ends by specifically recognizing the structure of a segment of newly polymerized tubulin.

transforming growth	TGF	Characterization and mutation analysis of human LEFTY A and LEFTY B, homologues of murine genes implicated in left-right axis development. Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family of cell-signaling molecules have been implicated recently in mammalian left-right (LR) axis development, the process by which vertebrates lateralize unpaired organs (e.g., heart, stomach, and spleen). Two family members, Lefty1 and Lefty2, are expressed exclusively on the left side of the mouse embryo by 8.0 days post coitum. This asymmetry is lost or reversed in two murine models of abnormal LR-axis specification, inversus viscerum (iv) and inversion of embryonic turning (inv). Furthermore, mice homozygous for a Lefty1 null allele manifest LR malformations and misexpress Lefty2. We hypothesized that Lefty mutations may be associated with human LR-axis malformations. We now report characterization of two Lefty homologues, LEFTY A and LEFTY B, separated by approximately 50 kb on chromosome 1q42. Each comprises four exons spliced at identical positions. LEFTY A is identical to ebaf, a cDNA previously identified in a search for genes expressed in human endometrium. The deduced amino acid sequences of LEFTY A and LEFTY B are more similar to each other than to Lefty1 or Lefty2. Analysis of 126 human cases of LR-axis malformations showed one nonsense and one missense mutation in LEFTY A. Both mutations lie in the cysteine-knot region of the protein LEFTY A, and the phenotype of affected individuals is very similar to that typically seen in Lefty1-/- mice with LR-axis malformations.

This asymmetry is lost or reversed in two murine models of abnormal LR-axis specification, inversus viscerum (iv) and inversion of embryonic turning (inv). Furthermore, mice homozygous for a Lefty1 null allele manifest LR malformations and misexpress Lefty2. We hypothesized that Lefty mutations may be associated with human LR-axis malformations. We now report characterization of two Lefty homologues, LEFTY A and LEFTY B, separated by approximately 50 kb on chromosome 1q42. Each comprises four exons spliced at identical positions. LEFTY A is identical to ebaf, a cDNA previously identified in a search for genes expressed in human endometrium. The deduced amino acid sequences of LEFTY A and LEFTY B are more similar to each other than to Lefty1 or Lefty2. Analysis of 126 human cases of LR-axis malformations showed one nonsense and one missense mutation in LEFTY A. Both mutations lie in the cysteine-knot region of the protein LEFTY A, and the phenotype of affected individuals is very similar to that typically seen in Lefty1-/- mice with LR-axis malformations.
calcitonin gene - related	CGRP	Testes exhibit elevated expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor component protein. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor component protein (RCP) is a novel protein that modulates CGRP responsiveness in a variety of cell types. Using probes based on the isolation of CGRP-RCP complementary DNA (cDNA) from a guinea pig organ of Corti cDNA library, we cloned human (h) and mouse (m) CGRP-RCP cDNAs, both of which encode 148-residue proteins that at the amino acid levels are approximately 88% identical to each other and to the 146-residue guinea pig CGRP-RCP. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of CGRP-RCP messenger RNA in all of the human and mouse tissues tested. In these human tissues, hCGRP-RCP messenger RNA (major band at approximately 3.1 kb, minor band at approximately 7.5 kb) was most prevalent in the testis. In the mouse, the highest abundance of CGRP-RCP RNA was clearly in the testis (major band at approximately 1.6 kb, minor band at approximately 1.1 kb). Based on this tissue distribution of RNA, we sought to identify the cells in the murine testis that contained CGRP-RCP protein. Numerous antisera generated against hCGRP-RCP, including one to recombinant hCGRP-RCP, exhibited strong immunoreactivity localized to the head region of spermatozoa. No CGRP-RCP immunoreactivity was observed in other cells at less mature stages of sperm maturation, in Sertoli or interstitial (Leydig) cells, or in human spermatozoa. Murine epididymal (mature) spermatozoa exhibited CGRP-RCP immunoreactivity identical to that of testicular spermatozoa. Spermatozoa that underwent an experimentally induced acrosome reaction (acrosomal discharge) lost their CGRP-RCP immunoreactivity. Therefore, it appears that CGRP-RCP is associated with the acrosome, suggesting that it may play an important role in reproduction.

phosphotyrosine	PTB	Cloning and characterization of a lymphoid-specific, inducible human protein tyrosine phosphatase, Lyp. Protein tyrosine phosphatases act in conjunction with protein kinases to regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation events that control cell activation and differentiation. We have isolated a previously undescribed human phosphatase, Lyp, that encodes an intracellular 105-kD protein containing a single tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain. The noncatalytic domain contains four proline-rich potential SH3 domain binding sites and an NXXY motif that, if phosphorylated, may be recognized by phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. Comparison of the Lyp amino acid sequence with other known proteins shows 70% identity with the murine phosphatase PEP. The human Lyp gene was localized to chromosome 1p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. We also identified an alternative spliced form of Lyp RNA, Lyp2. This isoform encodes a smaller 85-kD protein with an alternative C-terminus. The lyp phosphatases are predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues and cells, with Lyp1 being highly expressed in thymocytes and both mature B and T cells. Increased Lyp1 expression can be induced by activation of resting peripheral T lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3. Lyp1 was found to be constitutively associated with the proto-oncogene c-Cbl in thymocytes and T cells. Overexpression of lyp1 reduces Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that it may be a substrate of the phosphatase. Thus, Lyp may play a role in regulating the function of Cbl and its associated protein kinases.
epidermal growth	EGF	Cripto: a novel epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptide in mammary gland development and neoplasia. Growth and morphogenesis in the mammary gland depend on locally derived growth factors such as those in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily. Cripto-1 (CR-1, human; Cr-1, mouse)--also known as teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor-1--is a novel EGF-related protein that induces branching morphogenesis in mammary epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo and inhibits the expression of various milk proteins. In the mouse, Cr-1 is expressed in the growing terminal end buds in the virgin mouse mammary gland and expression increases during pregnancy and lactation. Cr-1/CR-1 is overexpressed in mouse and human mammary tumors and inappropriate overexpression of Cr-1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells can lead to the clonal expansion of ductal hyperplasias. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Cr-1/CR-1 performs a role in normal mammary gland development and that it might contribute to the early stages of mouse mammary tumorigenesis and the pathobiology of human breast cancer.

mitochondrial respiratory chain complex nadh : ubiquinone oxidoreduc	complex I	The human NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase NDUFS5 (15 kDa) subunit: cDNA cloning, chromosomal localization, tissue distribution and the absence of mutations in isolated complex I-deficient patients. We have cloned the cDNA of the NDUFS5 subunit (15 kDa) of the human mitochondrial respiratory chain complex NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). The open reading frame consists of 321 base-pairs, coding for 106 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 12.5 kDa. There is an 81.0% identity with the bovine equivalent on cDNA level and 74.5% identity on amino acid basis. PCR analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids revealed that the human NDUFS5 gene maps to chromosome 1. The NDUFS5 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with a relative higher expression in human heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and fetal heart. A mutation detection study of twenty isolated enzymatic complex I-deficient patients revealed no mutations, nor polymorphisms.
calmod	CaM	Interactions between neurogranin and calmodulin in vivo. Neurogranin is a neural-specific, calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) within its IQ domain at serine 36. Since CaM binds to neurogranin through the IQ domain, PKC phosphorylation and CaM binding are mutually exclusive. Consequently, we hypothesize that neurogranin may function to concentrate CaM at specific sites in neurons and release free CaM in response to increased Ca2+ and PKC activation. However, it has not been established that neurogranin interacts with CaM in vivo. In this study, we examined this question using yeast two-hybrid methodology. We also searched for additional proteins that might interact with neurogranin by screening brain cDNA libraries. Our data illustrate that CaM binds to neurogranin in vivo and that CaM is the only neurogranin-interacting protein isolated from brain cDNA libraries. Single amino acid mutagenesis indicated that residues within the IQ domain are important for CaM binding to neurogranin in vivo. The Ile-33 --> Gln point mutant completely inhibited and Arg-38 --> Gln and Ser-36 --> Asp point mutants reduced neurogranin/CaM interactions. These data demonstrate that CaM is the major protein that interacts with neurogranin in vivo and support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of neurogranin at Ser-36 regulates its binding to CaM.

None	BHMT	Interaction between dietary methionine and methyl donor intake on rat liver betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase gene expression and organization of the human gene. We previously showed that rat liver betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) mRNA content and activity increased 4-fold when rats were fed a methionine-deficient diet containing adequate choline, compared with rats fed the same diet with control levels of methionine (Park, E. I., Renduchintala, M. S., and Garrow, T. A. (1997) J. Nutr. Biochem. 8, 541-545). A further 2-fold increase was observed in rats fed the methionine-deficient diet with supplemental betaine. The nutrition studies reported here were designed to determine whether other methyl donors would induce rat liver BHMT gene expression when added to a methionine-deficient diet and to define the relationship between the degree of methionine restriction and level of methyl donor intake on BHMT expression. Therefore, rats were fed amino acid-defined diets varying in methionine and methyl donor composition. The effect of diet on BHMT expression was evaluated using Northern, Western, and enzyme activity analyses. Similar to when betaine was added to a methionine-deficient diet, choline or sulfonium analogs of betaine induced BHMT expression. The diet-induced induction of hepatic BHMT activity was mediated by increases in the steady-state level of its mRNA and immunodetectable protein. Using methyl donor-free diets, we found that methionine restriction was required but alone not sufficient for the high induction of BHMT expression. Concomitant with methionine restriction, dietary methyl groups were required for high levels of BHMT induction, and a dose-dependent relationship was observed between methyl donor intake and BHMT induction. Furthermore, the severity of methionine restriction influenced the magnitude of BHMT induction. To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of BHMT, we have cloned the human BHMT gene. This gene spans about 20 kilobases of DNA and contains 8 exons and 7 introns. Using RNA isolated from human liver and hepatoma cells, a major transcriptional start site has been mapped using the 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, and this start site is 26 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box.
	h	Sec24 proteins and sorting at the endoplasmic reticulum. COPII proteins are necessary to generate secretory vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum. In yeast, the Sec24p protein is the only COPII component in which two close orthologues have been identified. By using gene knock-out in yeast, we found that the absence of one of these Sec24 orthologues resulted in a selective secretion defect for a subset of proteins released into the medium. Data base searches revealed the existence of an entire family of Sec24-related proteins in humans, worms, flies, and plants. We identified and cloned two new human cDNAs encoding proteins homologous to yeast Sec24p, in addition to two human cDNAs already present within the data bases. The entire Sec24 family identified to date is characterized by clusters of highly conserved residues within the 2/3 carboxyl-terminal domain of all the proteins and a divergent amino terminus domain. Human (h) Sec24 orthologues co-immunoprecipitate with hSec23Ap and migrate as a complex by size exclusion chromatography. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that these proteins co-localize with hSec23p and hSec13p. Together, our data suggest that in addition to its role in the shaping up of the vesicle, the Sec23-24p complex may be implicated in cargo selection and concentration.
basic local alignment search	BLAST	Cloning and characterization of human guanine deaminase. Purification and partial amino acid sequence of the mouse protein. Mouse erythrocyte guanine deaminase has been purified to homogeneity. The native enzyme was dimeric, being comprised of two identical subunits of approximately 50,000 Da. The protein sequence was obtained from five cyanogen bromide cleavage products giving sequences ranging from 12 to 25 amino acids in length and corresponding to 99 residues. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of expressed sequence databases enabled the retrieval of a human expressed sequence tag cDNA clone highly homologous to one of the mouse peptide sequences. The presumed coding region of this clone was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library and secondarily to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the full-length coding sequence of the human brain cDNA corresponding to an open reading frame of 1365 nucleotides and encoding a protein of 51,040 Da. Comparison of the mouse peptide sequences with the inferred human protein sequence revealed 88 of 99 residues to be identical. The human coding sequence of the putative enzyme was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2, expressed, purified, and characterized as having guanine deaminase activity with a Km for guanine of 9.5 +/- 1.7 microM. The protein shares a 9-residue motif with other aminohydrolases and amidohydrolases (PGX[VI]DXH[TVI]H) that has been shown to be ligated with heavy metal ions, commonly zinc. The purified recombinant guanine deaminase was found to contain approximately 1 atom of zinc per 51-kDa monomer.
bone morphogenetic	BMPs	A novel BMP expressed in developing mouse limb, spinal cord, and tail bud is a potent mesoderm inducer in Xenopus embryos. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play critical roles in patterning the early embryo and in the development of many organs and tissues. We have identified a new member of this multifunctional gene family, BMP-11, which is most closely related to GDF-8/myostatin. During mouse embryogenesis, BMP-11 is first detected at 9.5 dpc in the tail bud with expression becoming stronger as development proceeds. At 10.0 dpc, BMP-11 is expressed in the distal and posterior region of the limb bud and later localizes to the mesenchyme between the skeletal elements. BMP-11 is also expressed in the developing nervous system, in the dorsal root ganglia, and dorsal lateral region of the spinal cord. To assess the biological activity of BMP-11, we tested the protein in the Xenopus ectodermal explant (animal cap) assay. BMP-11 induced axial mesodermal tissue (muscle and notochord) in a dose-dependent fashion. At higher concentrations, BMP-11 also induced neural tissue. Interestingly, the activin antagonist, follistatin, but not noggin, an antagonist of BMPs 2 and 4, inhibited BMP-11 activity on animal caps. Our data suggest that in Xenopus embryos, BMP-11 acts more like activin, inducing dorsal mesoderm and neural tissue, and less like other family members such as BMPs 2, 4, and 7, which are ventralizing and anti-neuralizing signals. Taken together, these data suggest that during vertebrate embryogenesis, BMP-11 plays a unique role in patterning both mesodermal and neural tissues.
human fibronect	FN	Crystal structure of a heparin- and integrin-binding segment of human fibronectin. The crystal structure of human fibronectin (FN) type III repeats 12-14 reveals the primary heparin-binding site, a clump of positively charged residues in FN13, and a putative minor site approximately 60 A away in FN14. The IDAPS motif implicated in integrin alpha4beta1 binding is at the FN13-14 junction, rendering the critical Asp184 inaccessible to integrin. Asp184 clamps the BC loop of FN14, whose sequence (PRARI) is reminiscent of the synergy sequence (PHSRN) of FN9. Mutagenesis studies prompted by this observation reveal that both arginines of the PRARI sequence are important for alpha4beta1 binding to FN12-14. The PRARI motif may represent a new class of integrin-binding sites. The spatial organization of the binding sites suggests that heparin and integrin may bind in concert.
alzheimer ' s beta - amyloid precursor	APP	Molecular cloning of human Fe65L2 and its interaction with the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein. We report the cDNA sequence of human Fe65L2. The human Fe65L2 encoded 486 amino acids; the deduced amino acid sequence was shorter by 18 amino acids than the rat protein and had 86% identity to the rat protein Three protein-protein interaction domains, a WW and two PID/PTB elements, were conserved among the Fe65 protein family. Human Fe65L2 mRNA was expressed in various tissues; a transcript of about 2.2 kb was mainly expressed in the brain. A splicing variant lacking two amino acids in the first PID/PTB element was detected. We also confirmed that the carboxyl-terminal region of PID/PTB of the Fe65L2 interacted with the intracellular domain of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP-like proteins.
None	NP	Structure of the type B human natriuretic peptide receptor gene and association of a novel microsatellite polymorphism with essential hypertension. The natriuretic peptide (NP) system may play a crucial role in development of essential hypertension (EH). C-type NP dilates arteries and lowers blood pressure and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells via the type B NP receptor (NPR-B). However, the association of the human NPR-B gene with EH has not been studied, because little is known about the genomic organization of this gene. We designed oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence of the human NPR-B gene, and long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. The amplified fragments were sequenced directly, and the exon/intron organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined. The gene, which spans approximately 16.5 kbp, is composed of 22 exons, and the intron-exon junctions follow the GT-AG rule. Seven hundred fifty base pairs of the 5'-flanking region were sequenced using a thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR (TAIL-PCR) method. This region contains 10 potential Sp1 binding sites and lacks a TATA box. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed the transcriptional start site at -14 bp. A CA/GT microsatellite repeat was identified with a hybridization-based method and was converted to a sequence-tagged site (STS). The GT microsatellite repeat was localized to intron 2 approximately 150 bp downstream of the exon-intron junction. Two alleles, (GT)10 and (GT)11, were detected in both EH patients and age-matched normotensive (NT) controls. Multiple logistic linear regression analysis indicated that the NPR-B genotype is associated significantly with EH (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.35). The (GT)11 frequency was 0.316 (65/206) for the EH group and 0.218 (44/202) for the NT group and differed significantly between the EH and NT groups (chi2=4.97, P=0.026). The structural organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined, and a novel GT repeat polymorphism, which associated with EH, was identified. These results suggest that one cause of EH is a mutation in this gene or a closely related gene or region.

A CA/GT microsatellite repeat was identified with a hybridization-based method and was converted to a sequence-tagged site (STS). The GT microsatellite repeat was localized to intron 2 approximately 150 bp downstream of the exon-intron junction. Two alleles, (GT)10 and (GT)11, were detected in both EH patients and age-matched normotensive (NT) controls. Multiple logistic linear regression analysis indicated that the NPR-B genotype is associated significantly with EH (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.35). The (GT)11 frequency was 0.316 (65/206) for the EH group and 0.218 (44/202) for the NT group and differed significantly between the EH and NT groups (chi2=4.97, P=0.026). The structural organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined, and a novel GT repeat polymorphism, which associated with EH, was identified. These results suggest that one cause of EH is a mutation in this gene or a closely related gene or region.
None	TAIL-PCR	Structure of the type B human natriuretic peptide receptor gene and association of a novel microsatellite polymorphism with essential hypertension. The natriuretic peptide (NP) system may play a crucial role in development of essential hypertension (EH). C-type NP dilates arteries and lowers blood pressure and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells via the type B NP receptor (NPR-B). However, the association of the human NPR-B gene with EH has not been studied, because little is known about the genomic organization of this gene. We designed oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence of the human NPR-B gene, and long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. The amplified fragments were sequenced directly, and the exon/intron organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined. The gene, which spans approximately 16.5 kbp, is composed of 22 exons, and the intron-exon junctions follow the GT-AG rule.

ste20 / oxidant stress response kinase -	SOK1	Isolation and characterization of a novel serine threonine kinase gene on chromosome 3p22-21.3. Through large-scale DNA sequencing of a genomic region on chromosome 3p22-p21.3, we isolated a novel gene encoding a 527-amino-acid protein. Its 18 exons spanned a genomic region of about 90 kilobases, and the 4536-nucleotide cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1581 base pairs. The gene was expressed in all 16 human tissues examined by Northern blotting. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein was 39% identical to that of human SOK1 (Ste20/oxidant stress response kinase-1), a molecule that is activated by oxidative stress. In view of its significant similarity to SOK1, we suspect that the novel gene, which we named OSR1, is a member of the SOK family of kinases in terms of function.
human regulator of g - protein signaling protein	RGS6	The human regulator of G-protein signaling protein 6 gene (RGS6) maps between markers WI-5202 and D14S277 on chromosome 14q24.3. The recently discovered regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, termed the RGS family, have been shown to modulate the functioning of G-proteins by activating the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the alpha subunits. Here, we report the chromosomal location and tissue expression of the human regulator of RGS6 gene. The messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis with a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid panel and a radiation hybrid panel indicated that the gene was mapped between genetic markers WI-5202 and D14S277 on chromosome 14q24.3 region.

mammalian nuclear pore	NPC	A conserved biogenesis pathway for nucleoporins: proteolytic processing of a 186-kilodalton precursor generates Nup98 and the novel nucleoporin, Nup96. The mammalian nuclear pore complex (NPC) is comprised of approximately 50 unique proteins, collectively known as nucleoporins. Through fractionation of rat liver nuclei, we have isolated >30 potentially novel nucleoporins and have begun a systematic characterization of these proteins. Here, we present the characterization of Nup96, a novel nucleoporin with a predicted molecular mass of 96 kD. Nup96 is generated through an unusual biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis of a 186-kD precursor protein. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor yields two nucleoporins: Nup98, a previously characterized GLFG-repeat containing nucleoporin, and Nup96. Mutational and functional analyses demonstrate that both the Nup98-Nup96 precursor and the previously characterized Nup98 (synthesized independently from an alternatively spliced mRNA) are proteolytically cleaved in vivo. This biogenesis pathway for Nup98 and Nup96 is evolutionarily conserved, as the putative Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues, N-Nup145p and C-Nup145p, are also produced through proteolytic cleavage of a precursor protein. Using immunoelectron microscopy, Nup96 was localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, at or near the nucleoplasmic basket. The correct targeting of both Nup96 and Nup98 to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC was found to be dependent on proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage process may regulate NPC assembly. Finally, by biochemical fractionation, a complex containing Nup96, Nup107, and at least two Sec13- related proteins was identified, revealing that a major sub-complex of the NPC is conserved between yeast and mammals.
insulin - like growth factor - binding protein	IGFBP6	Characterization and chromosomal localization of the human insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 gene. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 (IGFBP6), an extracellular protein with preferential affinity for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II, belongs to a family of binding proteins with at least six members. We have characterized the genomic structure and the chromosomal location of the human IGFBP6, which is present in the human genome as a single-copy gene spanning 4.7 kb. It consists of four exons, encoding the translated regions, with sizes of 334, 146, 120, and 123 bp, while the intervening introns are 2661, 182, and 844 bp. Three mRNA cap sites were localized 101, 100, and 96 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon as determined by S1 nuclease analysis. The proximal 5'-flanking region does not have any TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. The IGFBP6 was localized to Chr 12 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and regionalized to 12q13 by fluorescence DNA in situ hybridization.

human testis - enhanced gene	TEGT	Preliminary characterization of the protein encoded by human testis-enhanced gene transcript (TEGT). TEGT is a conserved, widely expressed gene transcript of unknown function that has been studied previously only at the nucleic acid level. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a highly hydrophobic, 26.5 kDa integral membrane protein with seven potential transmembrane domains. Little else is known about TEGT protein because of the lack of definitive homology to other known sequences and the absence of informative consensus motifs. The present report details a preliminary study of human TEGT (hTEGT) protein. (i) In vitro translation of hTEGT in reticulocyte lysates required the presence of microsomes for efficient synthesis, suggesting that hTEGT must target to the endoplasmic reticulum to be translated. Immunofluorescence of cells transiently expressing haemagglutinin-tagged hTEGT localized the protein mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein demonstrated no obvious post-translational modifications such as signal-peptide cleavage, N-linked glycosylation or O-linked glycosylation. (ii) Both hTEGT and haemagglutinin-tagged hTEGT appeared to retain partial secondary and tertiary structure in the presence of SDS. Both electrophoresed as a broad band or doublet with apparent molecular weights of 22-24.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE, aggregated either homotypically or heterotypically when boiled in SDS, and were toxic after 24 h when highly overexpressed in 293 T cells. These properties are believed to be caused by the protein's hydrophobicity. (iii) The protein appeared to associate strongly with other intracellular molecules since haemagglutinin-tagged hTEGT was extracted poorly from transiently transfected HeLa cells. Further study will be required to determine the cellular function of TEGT.

pseudouri	psi	Cloning and characterization of a mammalian pseudouridine synthase. This report describes the cloning and characterization of a pseudouridine (psi) synthase from mouse that we have named mouse pseudouridine synthase 1 (mpus1p). The cDNA is approximately 1.5 kb and when used as a probe on a Northern blot of mouse RNA from tissues and cultured cells, several bands were detected. The open reading frame is 393 amino acids and has 35% identity over its length with yeast psi synthase 1 (pus1p). The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified protein converted specific uridines to psi in a number of tRNA substrates. The positions modified in stoichiometric amounts in vitro were 27/28 in the anticodon stem and also positions 34 and 36 in the anticodon of an intron containing tRNA. A human cDNA was also cloned and the smaller open reading frame (348 amino acids) was 92% identical over its length with mpus1p but is shorter by 45 amino acids at the amino terminus. The expressed recombinant human protein has no activity on any of the tRNA substrates, most probably the result of the truncated open reading frame.
fluorescence in situ hybrid	FISH	Organization of the gene for gelatin-binding protein (GBP28). GBP28 is a novel human plasma gelatin-binding protein that is encoded by apM1 mRNA, expressed specifically in adipose tissue. Three overlapping clones (two lambda clones and one BAC clone) containing the human plasma gelatin-binding protein (GBP28) gene were isolated and characterized. The GBP28 gene spans 16kb and is composed of three exons from 18bp to 4277bp in size with consensus splice sites. The sizes of the two introns were 0.8 and 12kb, respectively. The gene's regulatory sequences contain putative promoter elements, but no typical TATA box.The third exon of this gene contains a long 3'-untranslated sequence containing three Alu repeats. The exon-intron organization of this gene was very similar to that of obese gene, encoding leptin. We also report the chromosome mapping of this gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a genomic DNA fragment as a probe. The GBP28 gene was located on human chromosome 3q27. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence databases with the accession numbers ABO12163, ABO12164 or ABO12165.
taxol resistance associated gene -	TRAG-3	TRAG-3, a novel gene, isolated from a taxol-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line. The mechanisms responsible for the development of the taxol resistance phenotype are unclear, and are likely explained by multiple mechanisms. To understand the molecular changes associated with drug resistance more fully, a taxol-resistant subline, derived from the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3, was established through selection by culture in incrementally increasing taxol concentrations. Comparison of SKOV-3 to SKOV-3TR by differential display identifies a new gene, TRAG-3 (Taxol Resistance Associated Gene- 3). In comparison to the parental line, SKOV-3, TRAG-3 mRNA is overexpressed in the taxol-resistant cell line SKOV-3TR. The nucleotide sequence of the TRAG-3 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 333bp that predicts for a protein product of 110 amino acids. A GenBank search identifies a cosmid clone containing a genomic sequence corresponding to that of TRAG-3. DNA and protein analysis reveals that TRAG-3 has no homology to any known cDNAs or proteins. Northern analysis demonstrates that TRAG-3 is overexpressed in the taxol-resistant breast cancer cell line MDA 435TR as well as the doxorubicin-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines 8226/DOX40 and 8226/MDR10V. A survey of normal tissue shows minimal or absent TRAG-3 mRNA expression. Screening of a wide variety of cancer cell lines demonstrates TRAG-3 expression in many cell lines derived from different tissue types. In summary, TRAG-3 is a novel gene whose expression is associated with the chemotherapy-resistant and neoplastic phenotype.
fluorescence in - situ hybrid	FISH	Cloning, expression and chromosomal localization of a human testis 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) is a bifunctional enzyme responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of Fru-2,6-P2, a key metabolite in the regulation of glycolysis. Several genes encode distinct PFK-2/FBPase-2 isozymes that differ in their tissue distribution and enzyme regulation. In this paper, we present the isolation of a cDNA from a human testis cDNA library that encodes a PFK-2/FBPase-2 isozyme. Sequencing data show an open reading frame of 1407 nucleotides that codifies for a protein of 469 amino acids. This has a calculated molecular weight of 54kDa and 97% similarity with rat testis PFK-2/FBPase-2, with complete conservation of the amino acid residues involved in the catalytic mechanism. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) localized testis PFK-2/FBPase-2 gene (PFKFB4) in human chromosome 3 at bands p21-p22. A Northern blot analysis of different rat tissues showed the presence of a 2.4-kb mRNA expressed specifically in testis. In mammalian COS-1 cells, the human testis cDNA drives expression of an isozyme with a molecular weight of 55kDa. This isozyme shows clear PFK-2 activity. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a new PFK-2/FBPase-2 gene coding for a human testis isozyme.
acute myeloid	AML	Cloning and chromosomal localization of the gene encoding human cyclin D-binding Myb-like protein (hDMP1). The murine transcription factor murine cyclin D-binding Myb-like protein (mDmp1) arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, through an activity that can be overridden by direct interaction with the D-type cyclins. Here, we describe the identification, sequence, chromosomal localization, and expression of the human cognate, hDMP1. The hDMP1 cDNA contains a 2280bp open reading frame that shares a high degree of identity with the mDmp1 coding region. The 4.4kb hDMP1 messenger RNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, with highest levels in testis and substructures within the brain. By use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with a human genomic P1 probe, we assigned hDMP1 to chromosome 7, band q21. This chromosomal region is frequently deleted as part of the 7q-minus and monosomy 7 abnormalities of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We analyzed hDMP1 copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization in leukemic blasts from nine patients with abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 7, and in each case one allele of the hDMP1 gene was deleted. Functional analysis of the mDmp1 protein has shown that it negatively regulates cell proliferation, which suggests that this gene is a candidate suppressor of malignant transformation. Further study will be needed to determine whether gene-specific mutations implicate hDMP1 as a tumor suppressor in acute leukemias with deletions of the long arm of chromosome 7 or in other types of human malignancy.

vasoactive intesinal	VIP	Molecular mapping of epitopes involved in ligand activation of the human receptor for the neuropeptide, VIP, based on hybrids with the human secretin receptor. Receptors for the neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine peptides, vasoactive intesinal peptide (VIP) and secretin, both belong to the Type B subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. This group is evolutionally as well as structurally distinct from the much larger Type A, or rhodopsin-type, subfamily. We have mapped the ligand-activating epitopes of the human VIP1 receptor by the use of hybrid receptor constructs with the human secretin receptor. Twelve chimeras were synthesized the successively replacing portions of the former receptor with corresponding portions of the latter receptor, or by interchanging the first extracellular loops. Each of the different chimeric receptor DNAs were then expressed in murine reporter cells, and their ability to activate cAMP production was investigated on stimulation with the respective natural peptide ligands. We stimulated the reporter cells with secretion or VIP following transient expression of the receptor chimeras. The experiments indicated that there are two molecular domains of importance for the recognition and activation of these peptides, namely, the inner portion of the extracellular tail and the first extracellular loop of the two receptors.
filament	F	2E4 (kaptin): a novel actin-associated protein from human blood platelets found in lamellipodia and the tips of the stereocilia of the inner ear. Platelet activation, crucial for hemostasis, requires actin polymerization, yet the molecular mechanisms by which localized actin polymerization is mediated are not clear. Here we report the characterization of a novel actin-binding protein, 2E4, originally isolated from human blood platelets and likely to be involved in the actin rearrangements occurring during activation. 2E4 binds to filamentous (F)-actin by F-actin affinity chromatography and is eluted from F-actin affinity columns and extracted from cells with ATP. Its presence at the leading edge of platelets spread on glass and in the lamellipodia of motile fibroblasts suggests a role in actin dynamics. Using localization to obtain clues about function, we stained the sensory epithelium of the embryonic inner ear to determine whether 2E4 is at the barbed end of actin filaments during their elongation. Indeed, 2E4 was present at the tips of the elongating stereocilium. 2E4 is novel by DNA sequence and has no identifiable structural motifs. Its unusual amino acid sequence, its ATP-sensitive actin association and its location at sites of actin polymerization in cells suggest 2E4 plays a unique role in the actin rearrangements that accompany platelet activation and stereocilia formation.
None	IL-8	Role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase in adenosine A2B receptor-mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast cells. The endogenous nucleoside adenosine is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma by stimulating mast cells. We previously showed that the human mast cell line HMC-1 expresses A2A and A2B receptors, and that both receptors activate adenylate cyclase via Gs-protein but that only A2B receptors are also coupled to phospholipase C via Gq proteins. Stimulation of A2B but not A2A receptors induced production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) from HMC-1 cells. The mechanism by which adenosine promotes IL-8 synthesis has not been defined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are involved in this process. Stimulation of HMC-1 with the stable adenosine analog NECA (5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) activated p21(ras) and both p42 and p44 isoforms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). NECA (10 microM) induced a 1.9 +/- 0. 06-fold increase in ERK activity, whereas 10 microM of the selective A2A agonist CGS 21680 (4-((N-ethyl-5'-carbamoyladenos-2-yl)-aminoethyl)-phenylpropionic acid) had no effect. NECA, in parallel with the activation of ERK, also stimulated the p46 isoform of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (MEK) and p38 MAPK. Furthermore, the selective MAPK/ERK kinase 1 inhibitor PD 98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone), and p38 MAPK inhibitors SB 202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole) and SB 203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H- imidaz ole) blocked A2B receptor-mediated production of IL-8. These results indicate that extracellular adenosine can regulate ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK signaling cascades and that activation of ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are essential steps in adenosine A2B receptor-dependent stimulation of IL-8 production in HMC-1.
None	MAPK	Role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase in adenosine A2B receptor-mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast cells. The endogenous nucleoside adenosine is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma by stimulating mast cells. We previously showed that the human mast cell line HMC-1 expresses A2A and A2B receptors, and that both receptors activate adenylate cyclase via Gs-protein but that only A2B receptors are also coupled to phospholipase C via Gq proteins. Stimulation of A2B but not A2A receptors induced production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) from HMC-1 cells. The mechanism by which adenosine promotes IL-8 synthesis has not been defined.

trans - golgi	TGN	Dynamin II is involved in endocytosis but not in the formation of transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network. Dynamins are a family of approximately 100-kDa GTPases that are thought to play a pivotal role in the formation of endocytic coated vesicles. There are three dynamin genes in mammals: dynamin I is neuron-specific, dynamin II shows ubiquitous expression, and dynamin III is expressed in testis, brain, and lung. However, most studies on the functions of dynamins to date have been restricted to dynamin I. In the present study, we show that, like dynamin I, dynamin II is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. While this study was in progress, Jones et al. [Jones, S.M., Howell, K.E., Henley, J.R., Cao, H., and McNiven, M.A. (1998) Science 279, 573-577] reported that dynamin II is localized in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and involved in the formation of constitutive transport vesicles and clathrin-coated vesicles from this compartment. However, immunofluorescence analyses and experiments using cells transfected with dominant-negative dynamin II failed to show any evidence for localization of dynamin II in the TGN or for its involvement in vesicle formation from this compartment. Our data thus indicate that dynamin II is involved in endocytosis but not in the formation of transport vesicles from the TGN.
repulsive guidance receptor	Robo	Slit proteins bind Robo receptors and have an evolutionarily conserved role in repulsive axon guidance. Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided in part by repulsive cues. Genetic analysis in Drosophila, reported in a companion to this paper, identifies the Slit protein as a candidate ligand for the repulsive guidance receptor Roundabout (Robo). Here we describe the characterization of three mammalian Slit homologs and show that the Drosophila Slit protein and at least one of the mammalian Slit proteins, Slit2, are proteolytically processed and show specific, high-affinity binding to Robo proteins. Furthermore, recombinant Slit2 can repel embryonic spinal motor axons in cell culture. These results support the hypothesis that Slit proteins have an evolutionarily conserved role in axon guidance as repulsive ligands for Robo receptors.
transmembrane protein	Robo	Vertebrate slit, a secreted ligand for the transmembrane protein roundabout, is a repellent for olfactory bulb axons. The olfactory bulb plays a central role in olfactory information processing through its connections with both peripheral and cortical structures. Axons projecting from the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon are guided by a repulsive activity in the septum. The molecular nature of the repellent is not known. We report here the isolation of vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila slit gene and show that Slit protein binds to the transmembrane protein Roundabout (Robo). Slit is expressed in the septum whereas Robo is expressed in the olfactory bulb. Functionally, Slit acts as a chemorepellent for olfactory bulb axons. These results establish a ligand-receptor relationship between two molecules important for neural development, suggest a role for Slit in olfactory bulb axon guidance, and reveal the existence of a new family of axon guidance molecules.
vascular endothelial cell growth	VEGF	Cloning, characterization, and chromosomal location of a novel human K+-Cl- cotransporter. Differential display polymerase chain reaction has been used to isolate genes regulated in vascular endothelial cells by the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Analysis of one of the bands consistently up-regulated by VEGF led us to the identification of a cDNA from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell library that is 77% identical to the human K+-Cl- cotransporter1 (KCC1). We have referred to the predicted protein as K+-Cl- cotransporter 3 (KCC3). Hydrophobicity analysis of the KCC3 amino acid sequence showed an almost identical pattern to KCC1, suggesting 12 membrane-spanning segments, a large extracellular loop with potential N-glycosylation sites, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. The KCC3 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, showing a distinct pattern and size from KCC1 and KCC2. The KCC3 mRNA level in endothelial cells increased on treatment with VEGF and decreased with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas KCC1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Stable overexpression of KCC3 cDNA in HEK293 cells produced a glycoprotein of approximately 150 kDa, which was reduced to 120 kDa by glycosidase digestion. An increased initial uptake rate of 86Rb was seen in clones with high KCC3 expression, which was dependent on extracellular Cl- but not Na+ and was inhibitable by the loop diuretic agent furosemide. The KCC3 genomic localization was shown to be 15q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Radiation hybrid analysis placed KCC3 within an area associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. These results suggest KCC3 is a new member of the KCC family that is under distinct regulation from KCC1.

hepatocellular carcino	HCC	A novel cytoplasmic protein with RNA-binding motifs is an autoantigen in human hepatocellular carcinoma. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autoantibodies to intracellular antigens are detected in 30-40% of patients. Patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis develop HCC, and when this occurs, some patients exhibit autoantibodies of new specificities. It has been suggested that these novel autoantibody responses may be immune system reactions to proteins involved in transformation-associated cellular events. One HCC serum shown to contain antibodies to unidentified cellular antigens was used to immunoscreen a cDNA expression library, and a full length cDNA clone was isolated with an open reading frame encoding 556 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. The 62-kD protein contained two types of RNA-binding motifs, the consensus sequence RNA-binding domain (CS-RBD) and four hnRNP K homology (KH) domains. This protein, provisionally called p62, has close identity (66-70%) to three other proteins at the amino acid sequence level, and all four proteins may belong to a family having CS-RBD in the NH2-terminal region and four KH domains in the mid-to-COOH- terminal region. The homologous proteins are: KH domain-containing protein overexpressed in cancer (Koc); zipcode binding protein, a protein which binds to a conserved nucleotide element in chicken beta-actin mRNA (ZBP1); and a protein which binds to a promoter cis element in Xenopus laevis TFIIIA gene (B3). p62 protein is cytoplasmic in location, and autoantibodies were found in 21% of a cohort of HCC patients. Patients with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, conditions which are frequent precursors to HCC, were negative for these autoantibodies, suggesting that the immune response might be related to cellular events leading to transformation. However, the possible involvement of p62 autoantigen as a factor in the transformation process remains to be elucidated.

chorea - acanthocy	CHAC	Genomic organization of the human galpha14 and Galphaq genes and mutation analysis in chorea-acanthocytosis (CHAC). Chorea-acanthocytosis (CHAC) (OMIM 200150) is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by neurodegeneration in combination with morphologically abnormal red cells (acanthocytosis). A partial yeast artificial chromosome contig of the CHAC critical region on chromosome 9q21 has been constructed, and 21 expressed sequence tags have been mapped. We have subsequently cloned Galpha14, a member of the G-protein alpha-subunit multigene family, and have identified Galphaq in the contig. The genomic structure of both genes has been established after construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome contig that showed Galphaq and Galpha14 to be in a head-to-tail arrangement (Cen-Galphaq-Galpha14-qter). Northern analysis found Galphaq to be ubiquitously expressed and Galpha14 to display a more restricted pattern of expression. Mutation analysis of the coding regions and splice sites for Galphaq and Galpha14 in 10 affected individuals from different families identified no changes likely to cause disease; however, two distinct single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of Galpha14 have been identified. This study has excluded two plausible candidate genes from involvement in CHAC and has provided a solid platform for a positional cloning initiative.

serum deprivation response	SDPR	The human serum deprivation response gene (SDPR) maps to 2q32-q33 and codes for a phosphatidylserine-binding protein. The serum deprivation response gene (SDPR, alias sdr) has been previously isolated for its high mRNA expression in serum-starved cells compared to contact-inhibited NIH3T3 cells; such regulation is not observed in single-oncogene transformed NIH3T3 cells after serum starvation. More recently Sdpr has been identified as a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC): this interaction determines the compartimentalization of PKC to caveolae, a plasma membrane invagination of which Sdpr is a major component. Lack of Sdpr-PKC interaction in transformed cells has been proposed to be involved in the alteration of PKC subcellular localization and substrate specificity. Here we report the cloning of the human SDPR homologue (HGMW-approved symbol SDPR) and its mapping to 2q32-q33 in the human genome. In analogy with the murine system, SDPR mRNA expression is increased when human fibroblasts are serum starved, it becomes down-regulated during synchronous cell-cycle reentry, but it is not induced in cells arrested by contact inhibition. Analysis of SDPR expression in human tissues reveals a near ubiquitous expression, with highest levels found in heart and lung. We show that human SDPR encodes PS-p68, a previously characterized phosphatidylserine-binding protein purified from human platelets. Accordingly, recombinant Sdpr is able to specifically bind phosphatidylserine in the absence of Ca2+. SDPR is homologous to two genes in the databank, one of which, srbc, is similarly regulated during growth arrest and encodes a phosphatidylserine-binding protein that is a substrate of PKC.

nucleoporin 155	NUP155	Localization of a human nucleoporin 155 gene (NUP155) to the 5p13 region and cloning of its cDNA. Nucleoporins are the main components of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Starting with an expressed DNA fragment retrieved by exon trapping from pooled human BAC clones mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5, we identified a human nucleoporin cDNA sequence by PCR from a human testis cDNA library. The coding sequence showed high homology to that of the rat nucleoporin 155 (Nup155) cDNA. FISH analysis with the human BAC clone as probe localized the human NUP155 gene to chromosome band 5p13. Northern analysis showed that the human NUP155 gene was expressed at different levels in all tissues tested. Two species of transcripts were observed with estimated lengths of 5.4 and 4.7 kb, respectively, in concordance with the finding of two alternative polyadenylation sites in the cDNA. The genomic location of the human NUP155 gene suggests a possible role in the mental and developmental retardation associated with hemizygous deletions of the 5p13 region.

To identify a new gene(s) located on the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone D142H8 that was mapped to human chromosome 21q22.1, purified YAC DNA from the clone was utilized directly as a probe to screen a human brain cDNA library after the suppression of human repetitive DNA. One cDNA clone hybridizing specifically to the YAC D142H8 DNA was identified. The clone has an insert of 1341 bp and the longest open reading frame of 349 amino acids. A search of GenBank revealed that the clone has a high degree of homology to zeta-crystallin (quinone reductase) at the amino acid level, and its nucleotide sequence represents the expressed sequence from the 50-kb segment of the human chromosome 21q11.1. Thus a new gene was named CRYZL1 (zeta-crystalline-like 1). Genomic Southern blot with total human and yeast DNAs suggests that CRYZL1 might be a single-copy gene. The fluorescence in situ hybridization procedure was applied, and the results showed that the gene mapped to the human chromosome 21q22.1 subband. The CRYZL1 mRNA was expressed in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, liver, and lungs but at different levels in different tissues.
None	PtdCho	Cloning and expression of a human choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase: synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Cholinephosphotransferase catalyses the final step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) via the Kennedy pathway by the transfer of phosphocholine from CDP-choline to diacylglycerol. Ethanolaminephosphotransferase catalyses an analogous reaction with CDP-ethanolamine as the phosphobase donor for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). Together these two enzyme activities determine both the site of synthesis and the fatty acyl composition of PtdCho and PtdEtn synthesized de novo. A human choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase cDNA (hCEPT1) was cloned, expressed and characterized. Northern blot analysis revealed one hCEPT1 2.3 kb transcript that was ubiquitous and not enriched, with respect to actin, in any particular cell type. The open reading frame predicts a protein (hCEPT1p) of 416 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 46550 Da containing seven membrane-spanning domains. A predicted amphipathic helix resides within the active site of the enzyme with the final two aspartic residues of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif, DG(X)2AR(X)8G(X)3D(X)3D, positioned within this helix. hCEPT1p was successfully expressed in a full-length, active form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells devoid of endogenous cholinephosphotransferase or ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities (HJ091, cpt1::LEU2 ept1-). In vitro, hCEPT1p displayed broad substrate specificity, utilizing both CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine as phosphobase donors to a broad range of diacylglycerols, resulting in the synthesis of both PtdCho and PtdEtn. In vivo, S. cerevisiae cells (HJ091, cpt1::LEU2 ept1-) expressing hCEPT1 efficiently incorporated both radiolabelled choline and ethanolamine into phospholipids, demonstrating that hCEPT1p has the ability to synthesize both choline- and ethanolamine- containing phospholipids in vitro and in vivo.

vascular endothelial growth	VEGF	Alternative splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-R1 (FLT-1) pre-mRNA is important for the regulation of VEGF activity. Angiogenesis is essential for normal mammalian development and is controlled by the local balance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors. Here we describe a novel mouse cDNA sequence encoding sFLT-1 that is a potent antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and show for the first time its in vivo production. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis with probes specific for sFLT-1 or FLT-1 showed that the relative abundance of their mRNAs changed markedly in spongiotrophoblast cells in the placenta as gestation progressed. On day 11 of pregnancy, sFLT-1 mRNA was undetectable but FLT-1 readily apparent, and by day 17 sFLT-1 mRNA was abundant but FLT-1 barely detectable. sFLT-1 was identified in conditioned medium of cultured placenta from day 17 pregnant mice and likely to be present in the circulation, as there is a substantial increase of VEGF-binding activity in the serum from day 13 of pregnancy, which coincides with the abundant sFLT-1 expression in placenta. Expression of sFLT-1 was also observed in adult lung, kidney, liver, and uterus. These data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of angiogenesis by alternative splicing of FLT-1 pre-mRNA. Treatment of pregnant mice with exogenous VEGF from day 9 to 17 of pregnancy, which alters the ratio of VEGF to sFLT-1, resulted in an increase in the number of resorption sites and fibrin deposition in the placenta of ongoing pregnancies. These findings have important implications for understanding placental function and may be relevant in a range of disease states.

prolactin regulatory element	PREB	Expression cloning and characterization of PREB (prolactin regulatory element binding), a novel WD motif DNA-binding protein with a capacity to regulate prolactin promoter activity. Previous studies have implied that a transcription factor(s) other than Pit-1 is involved in homeostatic regulation of PRL promoter activity via Pit-1-binding elements. One such element, 1P, was employed to clone from a rat pituitary cDNA expression library a novel 417-amino acid WD protein, designated PREB (PRL regulatory element binding) protein. PREB contains two PQ-rich potential transactivation domains, but no apparent DNA-binding motif, and exhibits sequence-specific binding to site 1P, to a site nonidentical to that for Pit-1. The PREB gene (or a related gene) is conserved, as an apparently single copy, in rat, human, fly, and yeast. A single approximately 1.9-kb PREB transcript accumulates in GH3 rat pituitary cells, to levels similar to Pit-1 mRNA. PREB transcripts were detected in all human tissues examined, but the observation of tissue-specific multiple transcript patterns suggests the possibility of tissue-specific alternative splicing. RT-PCR analysis of human brain tumor RNA samples suggested region-specific expression of PREB transcripts in brain. Western and immunocytochemical analysis implied that PREB accumulates specifically in GH3 cell nuclei. Transient transfection employing PREB-negative C6 rat glial cells showed that PREB is as active as, and additive with, Pit-1 in transactivation of a PRL promoter construct, and that PREB, but not Pit-1, can mediate transcriptional activation by protein kinase A (PKA). Expression in GH3 cells of a GAL4-PREB fusion protein both strongly transactivated a 5XGAL indicator construct and yielded a further stimulation of expression of this construct by coexpressed PKA, implying that PREB can mediate both basal and PKA-stimulated transcriptional responses in pituitary cells. These observations imply that PREB will prove to play a significant transcriptional regulatory role, both in the pituitary and in other organs in which transcripts of its gene are expressed.

nucleolar protein of 30 k	Nop30	Alternative splicing determines the intracellular localization of the novel nuclear protein Nop30 and its interaction with the splicing factor SRp30c. We report on the molecular cloning of a novel human cDNA by its interaction with the splicing factor SRp30c in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This cDNA is predominantly expressed in muscle and encodes a protein that is present in the nucleoplasm and concentrated in nucleoli. It was therefore termed Nop30 (nucleolar protein of 30 kDa). We have also identified a related cDNA with a different carboxyl terminus. Sequencing of the NOP gene demonstrated that both cDNAs are generated by alternative 5' splice site usage from a single gene that consists of four exons, spans at least 1800 nucleotides, and is located on chromosome 16q21-q23. The alternative 5' splice site usage introduces a frameshift creating two different carboxyl termini. The carboxyl terminus of Nop30 is rich in serines and arginines and has been found to target the protein into the nucleus, whereas its isoform is characterized by proline/glutamic acid dipeptides in its carboxyl terminus and is predominantly found in the cytosol. Interaction studies in yeast, in vitro protein interaction assays, and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that Nop30 multimerizes and binds to the RS domain of SRp30c but not to other splicing factors tested. Overexpression of Nop30 changes alternative exon usage in preprotachykinin and SRp20 reporter genes, suggesting that Nop30 influences alternative splice site selection in vivo.
None	PS-PLA1	An alternative splicing form of phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 that exhibits lysophosphatidylserine-specific lysophospholipase activity in humans. Phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1), which acts specifically on phosphatidylserine (PS) and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) to hydrolyze fatty acids at the sn-1 position of these phospholipids, was first identified in rat platelets (Sato, T., Aoki, J., Nagai, Y., Dohmae, N., Takio, K., Doi, T., Arai, H., and Inoue, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2192-2198). In this study we isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding human PS-PLA1, which showed 80% homology with rat PS-PLA1 at the amino acid level. In addition to an mRNA encoding a 456-amino acid product (PS-PLA1), an mRNA with four extra bases inserted at the boundary of the exon-intron junction was detected in human tissues and various human cell lines. This mRNA is most probably produced via an alternative use of the 5'-splicing site (two consensus sequences for RNA splicing occur at the boundary of the exon-intron junction) and encodes a 376-amino acid product (PS-PLA1DeltaC) that lacks two-thirds of the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1. Unlike PS-PLA1, PS-PLA1DeltaC hydrolyzed exclusively lyso-PS but not PS appreciably. Any other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA), and their lyso derivatives were not hydrolyzed at all. These data demonstrated that PS-PLA1DeltaC exhibits lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase activity and that the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1 is responsible for recognizing diacylphospholipids. In addition, human PS-PLA1 gene was mapped to chromosome 3q13.13-13.2 and was unexpectedly identical to the nmd gene, which is highly expressed in nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines but poorly expressed in metastatic cell lines (van Groningen, J. J., Bloemers, H. P., and Swart, G. W. (1995) Cancer Res. 55, 6237-6243).

alpha2 - adrenergic	alpha2-ARs	Role of arrestins in endocytosis and signaling of alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtypes. We investigated the role of arrestins in the trafficking of human alpha2-adrenergic receptors (alpha2-ARs) and the effect of receptor trafficking on p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. alpha2-ARs expressed in COS-1 cells demonstrated a modest level of agonist-mediated internalization, with alpha2c > alpha2b > alpha2a. However, upon coexpression of arrestin-2 (beta-arrestin-1) or arrestin-3 (beta-arrestin-2), internalization of the alpha2b AR was dramatically enhanced and redistribution of receptors to clathrin coated vesicles and endosomes was observed. Internalization of the alpha2c AR was selectively promoted by coexpression of arrestin-3, while alpha2a AR internalization was only slightly stimulated by coexpression of either arrestin. Coexpression of GRK2 had no effect on the internalization of any alpha2-AR subtype, either in the presence or absence of arrestins. Internalization of the alpha2b and alpha2c ARs was inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative dynamin-K44A. However, alpha2-AR-mediated activation of either endogenous or cotransfected p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was not affected by either dynamin-K44A or arrestin-3. Moreover, activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by endogenous epidermal growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and beta2-adrenergic receptors was also unaltered by dynamin-K44A. In summary, our data suggest that internalization of the alpha2b, alpha2c, and to a lesser extent alpha2a ARs, is both arrestin- and dynamin-dependent. However, endocytosis does not appear to be required for alpha2-adrenergic, epidermal growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, or beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated p42/p44 MAP kinase activation in COS-1 cells.

immediate -	IE	Herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16 discriminates between HCF-1 and a novel family member, HCF-2. Herpes simplex virus infection is initiated by VP16, a viral transcription factor that activates the viral immediate-early (IE) genes. VP16 does not recognize the IE gene promoters directly but instead forms a multiprotein complex with Oct-1 and HCF-1, a ubiquitous nuclear protein required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The functional significance of recruiting HCF-1 to the VP16-induced complex is not understood. Here we describe the identification of a second HCF-like protein, designated HCF-2. HCF-2 is smaller than HCF-1 but shares three regions of strong amino acid sequence homology, including the beta-propeller domain required for association with VP16. HCF-2 is expressed in many tissues, especially the testis, and shows a more dynamic pattern of subcellular localization than HCF-1. Although HCF-2 associates with VP16 and can support complex assembly with Oct-1 and DNA, it is significantly less efficient than HCF-1. A similar preference is shown by LZIP, a cellular counterpart of VP16. Analysis of chimeric proteins showed that differences between the fifth and sixth kelch repeats of the beta-propeller domains from HCF-1 and HCF-2 dictate this selectivity. These results reveal an unexpected level of specificity in the recruitment of HCF-1 to the VP16-induced complex, paralleling the preferential selection of Oct-1 rather than the closely related POU domain protein Oct-2. Implications for regulation of the viral life cycle are discussed.
x - linked sideroblastic anemia and ata	XLSA/A	Mutation of a putative mitochondrial iron transporter gene (ABC7) in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A). X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A) is a recessive disorder characterized by an infantile to early childhood onset of non-progressive cerebellar ataxia and mild anemia with hypochromia and microcytosis. A gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter was mapped to Xq13, a region previously shown by linkage analysis to harbor the XLSA/A gene. This gene, ABC7, is an ortholog of the yeast ATM1 gene whose product localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is involved in iron homeostasis. The full-length ABC7 cDNA was cloned and the entire coding region screened for mutations in a kindred in which five male members manifested XLSA/A. An I400M variant was identified in a predicted transmembrane segment of the ABC7 gene in patients with XLSA/A. The mutation was shown to segregate with the disease in the family and was not detected in at least 600 chromosomes of general population controls. Introduction of the corresponding mutation into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATM1 gene resulted in a partial loss of function of the yeast Atm1 protein. In addition, the human wild-type ABC7 protein was able to complement ATM1 deletion in yeast. These data indicate that ABC7 is the causal gene of XLSA/A and that XLSA/A is a mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the nuclear genome.

atp - binding	ABC	Adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein can compensate functionally for adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency (X-ALD): implications for therapy. Inherited defects in the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), for which no efficient treatment has been established so far. Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known: adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein (ALDRP), 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) and PMP70- related protein. By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP, we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate. These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X-ALD could be possible by drug-induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP.

adaptor protein	AP	Nef-induced CD4 degradation: a diacidic-based motif in Nef functions as a lysosomal targeting signal through the binding of beta-COP in endosomes. The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses downregulates the cell surface expression of CD4 through a two-step process. First, Nef connects the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 with adaptor protein complexes (AP), thereby inducing the formation of CD4-specific clathrin-coated pits that rapidly endocytose the viral receptor. Second, Nef targets internalized CD4 molecules for degradation. Here we show that Nef accomplishes this second task by acting as a connector between CD4 and the beta subunit of COPI coatomers in endosomes. A sequence encompassing a critical acidic dipeptide, located nearby but distinct from the AP-binding determinant of HIV-1 Nef, is responsible for beta-COP recruitment and for routing to lysosomes. A novel class of endosomal sorting motif, based on acidic residues, is thus revealed, and beta-COP is identified as its downstream partner.
apoptosis - linked - gene	ALG-2	Alix, a novel mouse protein undergoing calcium-dependent interaction with the apoptosis-linked-gene 2 (ALG-2) protein. ALG-2 is a EF hand calcium binding protein with sequence homologies to calmodulin. Vito et al have shown that ALG-2 expression is required for apoptosis following a number of death stimuli,1 although nothing is known about the effectors which underlie ALG-2 function. Here we have used ALG-2 as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library. We found that ALG-2 binds to itself and to a novel protein that we call ALG-2 interacting protein X, Alix. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we confirmed ALG-2/ALG-2 binding and demonstrated that this interaction is calcium independent. ALG-2/Alix interaction was also validated by co-immunoprecipitation, but in this case, the binding was found to be strictly calcium dependent. Alix seems highly conserved throughout evolution since it shows significant homologies to a putative C. elegans protein (YNK-1) and to proteins of A. nidulans (PalA) and S. cerevisiae (BRO1). Alix is a potential regulator or downstream effector of ALG-2 action.

wnt - inhibitory factor -	WIF-1	A new secreted protein that binds to Wnt proteins and inhibits their activities. The Wnt proteins constitute a large family of extracellular signalling molecules that are found throughout the animal kingdom and are important for a wide variety of normal and pathological developmental processes. Here we describe Wnt-inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), a secreted protein that binds to Wnt proteins and inhibits their activities. WIF-1 is present in fish, amphibia and mammals, and is expressed during Xenopus and zebrafish development in a complex pattern that includes paraxial presomitic mesoderm, notochord, branchial arches and neural crest derivatives. We use Xenopus embryos to show that WIF-1 overexpression affects somitogenesis (the generation of trunk mesoderm segments), in agreement with its normal expression in paraxial mesoderm. In vitro, WIF-1 binds to Drosophila Wingless and Xenopus Wnt8 produced by Drosophila S2 cells. Together with earlier results obtained with the secreted Frizzled-related proteins, our results indicate that Wnt proteins interact with structurally diverse extracellular inhibitors, presumably to fine-tune the spatial and temporal patterns of Wnt activity.
vanilloid receptor subtype	VR1	A capsaicin-receptor homologue with a high threshold for noxious heat. Pain-producing heat is detected by several classes of nociceptive sensory neuron that differ in their thermal response thresholds. The cloned capsaicin receptor, also known as the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), is a heat-gated ion channel that has been proposed to mediate responses of small-diameter sensory neurons to moderate (43 degrees C) thermal stimuli. VR1 is also activated by protons, indicating that it may participate in the detection of noxious thermal and chemical stimuli in vivo. Here we identify a structurally related receptor, VRL-1, that does not respond to capsaicin, acid or moderate heat. Instead, VRL-1 is activated by high temperatures, with a threshold of approximately 52 degrees C. Within sensory ganglia, VRL-1 is most prominently expressed by a subset of medium- to large-diameter neurons, making it a candidate receptor for transducing high-threshold heat responses in this class of cells. VRL-1 transcripts are not restricted to the sensory nervous system, indicating that this channel may be activated by stimuli other than heat. We propose that responses to noxious heat involve these related, but distinct, ion-channel subtypes that together detect a range of stimulus intensities.
modifier of position - effect - varieg	PEV	Functional mammalian homologues of the Drosophila PEV-modifier Su(var)3-9 encode centromere-associated proteins which complex with the heterochromatin component M31. The chromo and SET domains are conserved sequence motifs present in chromosomal proteins that function in epigenetic control of gene expression, presumably by modulating higher order chromatin. Based on sequence information from the SET domain, we have isolated human (SUV39H1) and mouse (Suv39h1) homologues of the dominant Drosophila modifier of position-effect-variegation (PEV) Su(var)3-9. Mammalian homologues contain, in addition to the SET domain, the characteristic chromo domain, a combination that is also preserved in the Schizosaccharyomyces pombe silencing factor clr4. Chromatin-dependent gene regulation is demonstrated by the potential of human SUV39H1 to increase repression of the pericentromeric white marker gene in transgenic flies. Immunodetection of endogenous Suv39h1/SUV39H1 proteins in a variety of mammalian cell lines reveals enriched distribution at heterochromatic foci during interphase and centromere-specific localization during metaphase. In addition, Suv39h1/SUV39H1 proteins associate with M31, currently the only other characterized mammalian SU(VAR) homologue. These data indicate the existence of a mammalian SU(VAR) complex and define Suv39h1/SUV39H1 as novel components of mammalian higher order chromatin.
gap - junction protein alpha -	GJA3	Connexin46 mutations in autosomal dominant congenital cataract. Loci for autosomal dominant " zonular pulverulent " cataract have been mapped to chromosomes 1q (CZP1) and 13q (CZP3). Here we report genetic refinement of the CZP3 locus and identify underlying mutations in the gene for gap-junction protein alpha-3 (GJA3), or connexin46 (Cx46). Linkage analysis gave a significantly positive two-point LOD score (Z) at marker D13S175 (maximum Z [Zmax]=>7.0; maximum recombination frequency [thetamax] =0). Haplotyping indicated that CZP3 probably lies in the genetic interval D13S1236-D13S175-D13S1316-cen-13pter, close to GJA3. Sequencing of a genomic clone isolated from the CZP3 candidate region identified an open reading frame coding for a protein of 435 amino acids (47,435 D) that shared approximately 88% homology with rat Cx46. Mutation analysis of GJA3 in two families with CZP3 detected distinct sequence changes that were not present in a panel of 105 normal, unrelated individuals. In family B, an A-->G transition resulted in an asparagine-to-serine substitution at codon 63 (N63S) and introduced a novel MwoI restriction site. In family E, insertion of a C at nucleotide 1137 (1137insC) introduced a novel BstXI site, causing a frameshift at codon 380. Restriction analysis confirmed that the novel MwoI and BstXI sites cosegregated with the disease in families B and E, respectively. This study identifies GJA3 as the sixth member of the connexin gene family to be implicated in human disease, and it highlights the physiological importance of gap-junction communication in the development of a transparent eye lens.

amyloid - beta	Abeta	Two transmembrane aspartates in presenilin-1 required for presenilin endoproteolysis and gamma-secretase activity. Accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex is an early and invariant event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The final step in the generation of Abeta from the beta-amyloid precursor protein is an apparently intramembranous proteolysis by the elusive gamma-secretase(s). The most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease is mutation of the genes encoding presenilins 1 and 2, which alters gamma-secretase activity to increase the production of the highly amyloidogenic Abeta42 isoform. Moreover, deletion of presenilin-1 in mice greatly reduces gamma-secretase activity, indicating that presenilin-1 mediates most of this proteolytic event. Here we report that mutation of either of two conserved transmembrane (TM) aspartate residues in presenilin-1, Asp 257 (in TM6) and Asp 385 (in TM7), substantially reduces Abeta production and increases the amounts of the carboxy-terminal fragments of beta-amyloid precursor protein that are the substrates of gamma-secretase. We observed these effects in three different cell lines as well as in cell-free microsomes. Either of the Asp --> Ala mutations also prevented the normal endoproteolysis of presenilin-1 in the TM6 --> TM7 cytoplasmic loop. In a functional presenilin-1 variant (carrying a deletion in exon 9) that is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease and which does not require this cleavage, the Asp 385 --> Ala mutation still inhibited gamma-secretase activity. Our results indicate that the two transmembrane aspartate residues are critical for both presenilin-1 endoproteolysis and gamma-secretase activity, and suggest that presenilin 1 is either a unique diaspartyl cofactor for gamma-secretase or is itself gamma-secretase, an autoactivated intramembranous aspartyl protease.

beta - galactoside alpha2 , 3 - sialyltransferas	ST	Molecular cloning of a novel alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal VI) that sialylates type II lactosamine structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids. A novel member of the human CMP-NeuAc:beta-galactoside alpha2, 3-sialyltransferase (ST) subfamily, designated ST3Gal VI, was identified based on BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags, and a cDNA clone was isolated from a human melanoma line library. The sequence of ST3Gal VI encoded a type II membrane protein with 2 amino acids of cytoplasmic domain, 32 amino acids of transmembrane region, and a large catalytic domain with 297 amino acids; and showed homology to previously cloned ST3Gal III, ST3Gal IV, and ST3Gal V at 34, 38, and 33%, respectively. Extracts from L cells transfected with ST3Gal VI cDNA in a expression vector and a fusion protein with protein A showed an enzyme activity of alpha2, 3-sialyltransferase toward Galbeta1,4GlcNAc structure on glycoproteins and glycolipids. In contrast to ST3Gal III and ST3Gal IV, this enzyme exhibited restricted substrate specificity, i.e. it utilized Galbeta1,4GlcNAc on glycoproteins, and neolactotetraosylceramide and neolactohexaosylceramide, but not lactotetraosylceramide, lactosylceramide, or asialo-GM1. Consequently, these data indicated that this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of sialyl-paragloboside, a precursor of sialyl-Lewis X determinant.
glutamate carboxypeptida	PGCP	Purification, cDNA cloning, and expression of a new human blood plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase homologous to N-acetyl-aspartyl-alpha-glutamate carboxypeptidase/prostate-specific membrane antigen. We describe the identification, cDNA cloning, and biochemical characterization of a new human blood plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (PGCP). PGCP was co-purified from human placenta with lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A, lysosomal endopeptidase, cathepsin D, and a gamma-interferon-inducible protein, IP-30, using an affinity chromatography on a Phe-Leu-agarose column. A PGCP cDNA was obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone and completed at 5'-end by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA contained a 1623-base pair open reading frame predicting a 541-amino acid protein, with five putative Asn glycosylation sites and a 21-residue signal peptide. PGCP showed significant amino acid sequence homology to several cocatalytic metallopeptidases including a glutamate carboxypeptidase II also known as N-acetyl-aspartyl-alpha-glutamate carboxypeptidase or as prostate-specific membrane antigen and expressed glutamate carboxypeptidase activity. Expression of the PGCP cDNA in COS-1 cells, followed by Western blotting and metabolic labeling showed that PGCP is synthesized as a 62-kDa precursor, which is processed to a 56-kDa mature form containing two Asn-linked oligosaccharide chains. The mature form of PGCP was secreted into the culture medium, which is consistent with its intracellular localization in secretion granules. In humans, PGCP is found principally in blood plasma, suggesting a potential role in the metabolism of secreted peptides.
None	APC	The catenin p120(ctn) interacts with Kaiso, a novel BTB/POZ domain zinc finger transcription factor. p120(ctn) is an Armadillo repeat domain protein with structural similarity to the cell adhesion cofactors beta-catenin and plakoglobin. All three proteins interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin; beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind a carboxy-terminal region in a mutually exclusive manner, while p120 binds the juxtamembrane region. Unlike beta-catenin and plakoglobin, p120 does not interact with alpha-catenin, the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), or the transcription factor Lef-1, suggesting that it has unique binding partners and plays a distinct role in the cadherin-catenin complex. Using p120 as bait, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified a novel transcription factor which we named Kaiso. Kaiso's deduced amino acid sequence revealed an amino-terminal BTB/POZ protein-protein interaction domain and three carboxy-terminal zinc fingers of the C2H2 DNA-binding type. Kaiso thus belongs to a rapidly growing family of POZ-ZF transcription factors that include the Drosophila developmental regulators Tramtrak and Bric à brac, and the human oncoproteins BCL-6 and PLZF, which are causally linked to non-Hodgkins' lymphoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies to Kaiso were generated and used to immunolocalize the protein and confirm the specificity of the p120-Kaiso interaction in mammalian cells. Kaiso specifically coprecipitated with a variety of p120-specific monoclonal antibodies but not with antibodies to alpha- or beta-catenin, E-cadherin, or APC. Like other POZ-ZF proteins, Kaiso localized to the nucleus and was associated with specific nuclear dots. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays mapped the binding domains to Arm repeats 1 to 7 of p120 and the carboxy-terminal 200 amino acids of Kaiso. In addition, Kaiso homodimerized via its POZ domain but it did not heterodimerize with BCL-6, which heterodimerizes with PLZF. The involvement of POZ-ZF proteins in development and cancer makes Kaiso an interesting candidate for a downstream effector of cadherin and/or p120 signaling.
t - cell	TCR	hSiah2 is a new Vav binding protein which inhibits Vav-mediated signaling pathways. The hematopoietic proto-oncogene vav has been characterized as a Rac1-GDP/GTP exchanger protein which regulates cytoskeletal reorganization as well as signaling pathways leading to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNKs). Furthermore, vav overexpression enhances basal and T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We report here the interaction between Vav and hSiah2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Seven in absentia (Sina) that has been implicated in R7 photoreceptor cell formation during Drosophila eye development via the proteasome degradation pathway. Vav and hSiah2 interact in vitro and in vivo and colocalize in the cytoplasm of hematopoietic cells. The Src homology domain of Vav and the C-terminal region of hSiah2 are required for this interaction. We provide evidence for a negative regulation by hSiah2 of Vav-induced basal and TCR-mediated NFAT-dependent transcription. Overexpression of hSiah2 also inhibits the onco-Vav-induced JNK activation. Although the Vav-interacting domain is located in the C-terminal portion of hSiah2, the N-terminal region of hSiah2 is necessary for the inhibitory role that seems to be independent of the proteasome degradation.

We provide evidence for a negative regulation by hSiah2 of Vav-induced basal and TCR-mediated NFAT-dependent transcription. Overexpression of hSiah2 also inhibits the onco-Vav-induced JNK activation. Although the Vav-interacting domain is located in the C-terminal portion of hSiah2, the N-terminal region of hSiah2 is necessary for the inhibitory role that seems to be independent of the proteasome degradation.
drosophila seven in absent	Sina	hSiah2 is a new Vav binding protein which inhibits Vav-mediated signaling pathways. The hematopoietic proto-oncogene vav has been characterized as a Rac1-GDP/GTP exchanger protein which regulates cytoskeletal reorganization as well as signaling pathways leading to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNKs). Furthermore, vav overexpression enhances basal and T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We report here the interaction between Vav and hSiah2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Seven in absentia (Sina) that has been implicated in R7 photoreceptor cell formation during Drosophila eye development via the proteasome degradation pathway.

aml1 / core binding factor	CBFbeta	HERF1, a novel hematopoiesis-specific RING finger protein, is required for terminal differentiation of erythroid cells. The AML1/core binding factor beta (CBFbeta) transcription factor is essential for definitive hematopoiesis; however, the downstream pathways through which it functions remain incompletely defined. Using a differential cloning approach to define components of this pathway, we have identified a novel gene designated HERF1 (for hematopoietic RING finger 1), whose expression during development is dependent on the presence of functional AML1/CBFbeta. HERF1 contains a tripartite RING finger-B box-alpha-helical coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal region homologous to the ret proto-oncogene-encoded finger protein. Expression of HERF1 during embryogenesis coincides with the appearance of definitive erythropoiesis and in adult mice is restricted to erythroid cells, increasing 30-fold during terminal differentiation. Importantly, inhibition of HERF1 expression blocked terminal erythroid differentiation of the murine erythroleukemia cell line MEL, whereas its overexpression induced erythroid maturation. These results suggest an important role for this protein in erythropoiesis.

deleted in lung cancer	DLC1	Molecular cloning of a candidate tumor suppressor gene, DLC1, from chromosome 3p21.3. The short arm of chromosome 3 is thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes, because one copy of this chromosomal arm frequently is missing in carcinomas that have arisen in a variety of tissues. We have isolated a novel gene encoding a 1755-amino acid polypeptide, through large-scale sequencing of genomic DNA at 3p21.3. Mutational analysis of this gene by reverse transcription-PCR revealed the lack of functional transcripts and an increase of nonfunctional RNA transcripts in a significant proportion (33%) of cancer cell lines and primary cancers (4 of 14 esophageal cancer cell lines, 2 of 2 renal cancer cell lines, 11 of 30 primary non-small cell lung cancers, and 3 of 10 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus). However, no alterations of the gene itself were detected in any of the cancers examined. Introduction of the cDNA significantly suppressed the growth of four different cancer cell lines, two of which produced no normal transcript on their own. No such effect occurred when antisense cDNA, cDNA corresponding to an aberrant transcript, or the vector DNA alone were transfected. These data suggest that aberrant transcription of this gene, designated DLC1 (deleted in lung cancer 1), may be involved in carcinogenesis of the lung, esophagus, and kidney.
oxytoc	OT	Demonstration of functional oxytocin receptors in human breast Hs578T cells and their up-regulation through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. Oxytocin (OT) receptors (OTRs) have been demonstrated in a number of human breast tumors and tumor cells, but it was not clear whether the receptors were functional. We examined the regulation and function of OTR in a tumor cell line, Hs578T, derived from human breast. These cells expressed moderate levels of OTR when cultured in 10% FBS, as demonstrated by RT-PCR and binding analyses. Serum deprivation resulted in the loss of OTRs, with no effect on cell viability. Restoration of serum and addition of 1 microM dexamethasone (DEX) increased OTR levels by about 9-fold. Up-regulation was blocked by the addition of phospholipase C and PKC inhibitors. Serum/DEX treatment also increased steady state OTR messenger RNA levels. OT increased intracellular Ca2+ in a time- and dose-responsive manner, and the effects of OT were lost when OTRs were down-regulated by serum starvation. Serum/DEX up-regulation of OTR restored the responsiveness to OT. OT also stimulated ERK-2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) phosphorylation and PGE2 synthesis in Hs578T cells. In addition to showing that OTRs in the breast tumor cells are functional, these studies show that Hs578T cells can be used to study molecular regulation of OTR gene expression and intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by OT.

ku70 - binding	KUBs	Isolation of Ku70-binding proteins (KUBs). DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays a critical role in resealing DNA double-stand breaks by non-homologous end joining. Aside from DNA-PK, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, other proteins which play a role(s) in this repair pathway remain unknown; DNA-PK contains a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a DNA binding subunit (Ku70 and Ku80). We isolated Ku70-binding proteins (KUB1-KUB4) using yeast two-hybrid analyses. Sequence analyses revealed KUB1 to be apolipoprotein J (apoJ), also known as X-ray-inducible transcript 8 (XIP8), testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 (TRPM-2) and clusterin. KUB2 is Ku80. KUB3 and KUB4 are unknown, >10 kb trans-cripts. Interactions of apoJ/XIP8 or KUB3 with Ku70 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in MCF-7:WS8 breast cancer or IMR-90 normal lung fibroblast cells, respectively. The interaction of apoJ/XIP8 with Ku70 was confirmed by far-western analyses. Stable over-expression of full-length apoJ/XIP8 in MCF-7:WS8 caused decreased Ku70/Ku80 DNA end binding that was restored by apoJ/XIP8 monoclonal antibodies. The role of apoJ/XIP8 in ionizing radiation resistance/sensitivity is under investigation.

mink - related peptide	MiRP1	MiRP1 forms IKr potassium channels with HERG and is associated with cardiac arrhythmia. A novel potassium channel gene has been cloned, characterized, and associated with cardiac arrhythmia. The gene encodes MinK-related peptide 1 (MiRP1), a small integral membrane subunit that assembles with HERG, a pore-forming protein, to alter its function. Unlike channels formed only with HERG, mixed complexes resemble native cardiac IKr channels in their gating, unitary conductance, regulation by potassium, and distinctive biphasic inhibition by the class III antiarrhythmic E-4031. Three missense mutations associated with long QT syndrome and ventricular fibrillation are identified in the gene for MiRP1. Mutants form channels that open slowly and close rapidly, thereby diminishing potassium currents. One variant, associated with clarithromycin-induced arrhythmia, increases channel blockade by the antibiotic. A mechanism for acquired arrhythmia is revealed: genetically based reduction in potassium currents that remains clinically silent until combined with additional stressors.
photoreceptor - specific nuclear	PNR	Identification of a photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor. Nuclear receptors comprise a large and expanding family of transcription factors involved in diverse aspects of animal physiology and development, the functions of which can be modulated in a spatial and temporal manner by access to small lipophilic ligands and/or the specificity of their own localized expression. Here we report the identification of a human nuclear receptor that reveals a unique proximal box (CNGCSG) in the DNA-binding domain. The conservation of this feature in its nematode counterpart suggests the requirement for this type of P box in the genetic cascades mediated by nuclear receptors in a wide variety of animal species. The expression of this receptor, PNR (photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor), appears strongly restricted in the retina, exclusively in photoreceptor cells. In human cell lines, PNR expression was observed in Y79 retinoblastoma along with other photoreceptor marker genes such as CRX. Among vertebrate receptors, PNR shares structural kinship with an orphan receptor TLX, and despite distinct differences in the DNA binding domain, PNR is able to recognize a subset of TLX target sequences in vitro. Analyses of the human PNR gene revealed its chromosomal position as 15q24, a site that has recently been reported as a susceptible region for retinal degeneration. These data support a role for PNR in the regulation of signalling pathways intrinsic to the photoreceptor cell function.
adipocyte - derived leucine aminopeptida	A-LAP	Molecular cloning of adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase highly related to placental leucine aminopeptidase/oxytocinase. In the current study, we report the cloning and initial characterization of a novel human cytosolic aminopeptidase named adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP). The sequence encodes a 941-amino acid protein with significant homology (43%) to placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP)/oxytocinase. The predicted A-LAP contains the HEXXH(X)18E consensus sequence, which is characteristic of the M1 family of zinc-metallopeptidases. Although the deduced sequence contains a hydrophobic region near the N-terminus, the enzyme localized mainly in cytoplasm when expressed in COS-7 cells. Northern blot analysis revealed that A-LAP was expressed in all the tissues tested, some of which expressed at least three forms of mRNA, suggesting that the regulation of the gene expression is complex. When aminopeptidase activity of A-LAP was measured with various synthetic substrates, the enzyme revealed a preference for leucine, establishing that A-LAP is a novel leucine aminopeptidase with restricted substrate specificity. The identification of A-LAP, which reveals strong homology to P-LAP, might lead to the definition of a new subfamily of zinc-containing aminopeptidases belonging to the M1 family of metallopeptidases.

complementary	cDNA	Identification and cloning of putative human neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-2 and gamma-3 subunits: neurologic implications. OBJECTIVE: To identify human genes encoding neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma subunits corresponding to the gamma subunit recently described in mice with hereditary epilepsy, confirm their expression in adult brain, and determine whether a gamma subunit resides in human chromosomal regions with marker genes linked to convulsions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human homologues of a recently described mouse gamma subunit were sought by a computerized search of National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. Sequences of interest were mapped electronically to specific chromosomal regions. The proximity of these chromosomal regions to markers linked to convulsive disorders was determined by a MEDLINE search. Predicted gamma subunit sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human adult brain complementary DNA (cDNA) library and were subcloned, and full-length sequences were determined or confirmed. Secondary structure and transmembrane regions were predicted by using the TMpredict program. RESULTS: Two putative isoforms (human gamma-2 and gamma-3 calcium channel subunits) were identified, cloned, and sequenced. They mapped to chromosomes 22 and 16, respectively. A marker very close to the gamma-3 gene gives maximal lod scores for an autosomal dominant syndrome of familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis. CONCLUSION: Genomic DNA sequence data already existed in GenBank (partial for gamma-2 and complete for gamma-3) for the two putative neuronal calcium channel gamma subunits that we identified. By cloning both of these molecules from a cerebellar cDNA library, we demonstrated for the first time their expression in human brain. The gamma-3 gene is adjacent to a marker for a convulsive disorder. The convulsive phenotype of gamma channelopathies occurring in mice makes the human gamma subunit genes attractive candidate genes for hereditary convulsive disorders.
stearoyl - coa desatura	Scd	Human stearoyl-CoA desaturase: alternative transcripts generated from a single gene by usage of tandem polyadenylation sites. A critical step in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids is catalysed by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd). To determine the regulation of human Scd, we characterized the gene and its transcripts. Screening a human keratinocyte cDNA library and analysis of 3'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) products from various tissues yielded a 5.2 kb cDNA encoding a 359 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 41.5 kDa. Analysis of 3'-RACE products suggested that alternative usage of polyadenylation sites generates two transcripts of 3.9 and 5.2 kb, a result consistent with Northern analysis. Southern analysis demonstrated the existance of two SCD loci in the human genome. Chromosomal mapping localized one locus to chromosome 10, and the second locus to chromosome 17. Characterization of genomic clones isolated from chromosome-specific libraries revealed that only the locus on chromosome 10 contained introns. Sequence analysis of the intron-less locus displayed multiple nucleotide insertions and deletions, as well as in-frame stop codons. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis performed with primers specific to the intron-less locus failed to produce a PCR product from brain, liver and skin RNA, indicating that the locus on chromosome 17 is most likely a transcriptionally inactive, fully processed pseudogene. These results suggest strongly that there is one structural SCD gene in the human genome, and that it generates two transcripts by use of alternative polyadenyation sites. Although the primary sequence and intron-exon structure of SCD is phylogenetically conserved, divergence between rodent and human is seen in the number of SCD genes and in the generation of alternative transcripts, suggesting a species-specific component of SCD regulation and function.
thymus - expressed chemokin	TECK	Cutting edge: identification of the orphan chemokine receptor GPR-9-6 as CCR9, the receptor for the chemokine TECK. Thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK) has been reported to chemoattract dendritic cells, thymocytes, and activated macrophages. Here, we show that TECK is a specific agonist for a human orphan receptor called GPR-9-6. We have determined the cDNA sequence of human GPR-9-6 and cloned the corresponding murine cDNA. Human and murine GPR-9-6 expression is very high in the thymus and low in lymph nodes and spleen. RT-PCR analysis of murine GPR-9-6 expression on murine FACS-sorted thymocyte subpopulations showed that this gene is expressed in both immature and mature T cells. Additions of human or murine TECK to HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 and HEK 293/murine GPR-9-6 transfectants provoked intracytoplasmic calcium mobilization. Human TECK also induced the in vitro migration of HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 cells. These results confirm that GPR-9-6 is a specific receptor for TECK. According to the established nomenclature system, we propose to rename GPR-9-6 as CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9).

protein kinase	PKC	PKCnu, a new member of the protein kinase C family, composes a fourth subfamily with PKCmu. Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases are thought to play critical roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation in many cell types. An additional member of the PKC family was identified through human expressed sequence tag (EST) database search and its full length cDNA was isolated.

We designated the new member as protein kinase C nu (PKCnu). The PKCnu messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues when analyzed by Northern blots and reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses.

Recently, five human homologs of Drosophila Toll, designated as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), have been identified and shown to play a role in the innate immune response. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a new member of Toll-like receptor family, Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6). Human and murine TLR6 are type-I transmembrane receptors that contain both an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-like region. The amino acid sequence of human TLR6 (hTLR6) is most similar to that of hTLR1 with 69% identity. RT-PCR analysis revealed that murine TLR6 is expressed predominantly in spleen, thymus, ovary and lung. Like other TLR family members, constitutively active TLR6 activates both NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The TLR6 gene, as well as the TLR1 gene, mapped to the proximal region of murine chromosome 5 within 1.7cM of each other. These results suggest that TLR6 is a novel member of an expanding TLR family.

None	HA	Glucose-induced autophagy of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris requires a unique E1-like protein. Cytosolic and peroxisomal enzymes necessary for methanol assimilation are synthesized when Pichia pastoris is grown in methanol. Upon adaptation from methanol to a glucose environment, these enzymes are rapidly and selectively sequestered and degraded within the yeast vacuole. Sequestration begins when the vacuole changes shape and surrounds the peroxisomes. The opposing membranes then fuse, engulfing the peroxisome. In this study, we have characterized a mutant cell line (glucose-induced selective autophagy), gsa7, which is defective in glucose-induced selective autophagy of peroxisomes, and have identified the GSA7 gene. Upon glucose adaptation, gsa7 cells were unable to degrade peroxisomal alcohol oxidase. We observed that the peroxisomes were surrounded by the vacuole, but complete uptake into the vacuole did not occur. Therefore, we propose that GSA7 is not required for initiation of autophagy but is required for bringing the opposing vacuolar membranes together for homotypic fusion, thereby completing peroxisome sequestration. By sequencing the genomic DNA fragment that complemented the gsa7 phenotype, we have found that GSA7 encodes a protein of 71 kDa (Gsa7p) with limited sequence homology to a family of ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E1. The knockout mutant gsa7Delta had an identical phenotype to gsa7, and both mutants were rescued by an epitope-tagged Gsa7p (Gsa7-hemagglutinin [HA]). In addition, a GSA7 homolog, APG7, a protein required for autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was capable of rescuing gsa7. We have sequenced the human homolog of GSA7 and have shown many regions of identity between the yeast and human proteins. Two of these regions align to the putative ATP-binding domain and catalytic site of the family of ubiquitin activating enzymes, E1 (UBA1, UBA2, and UBA3). When either of these sites was mutated, the resulting mutants [Gsa7(DeltaATP)-HA and Gsa7(C518S)-HA] were unable to rescue gsa7 cells. We provide evidence to suggest that Gsa7-HA formed a thio-ester linkage with a 25-30 kDa protein. This conjugate was not observed in cells expressing Gsa7(DeltaATP)-HA or in cells expressing Gsa7(C518S)-HA. Our results suggest that this unique E1-like enzyme is required for homotypic membrane fusion, a late event in the sequestration of peroxisomes by the vacuole.

human munc	hmunc13	Human munc13 is a diacylglycerol receptor that induces apoptosis and may contribute to renal cell injury in hyperglycemia. We have previously shown that human munc13 (hmunc13) is up-regulated by hyperglycemia under in vitro conditions in human mesangial cell cultures. The purpose of the present study was to determine the cellular function of hmunc13. To do this, we have investigated the subcellular localization of hmunc13 in a transiently transfected renal cell line, opossum kidney cells. We have found that hmunc13 is a cytoplasmic protein and is translocated to the Golgi apparatus after phorbol ester stimulation. In addition, cells transfected with hmunc13 demonstrate apoptosis after treatment with phorbol ester, but cells transfected with an hmunc13 deletion mutant in which the diacylglycerol (C1) binding domain is absent exhibit no change in intracellular distribution and no induction of apoptosis in the presence of phorbol ester stimulation. We conclude that both the diacylglycerol-induced translocation and the apoptosis represent functional activity of hmunc13. We have also demonstrated that munc13-1 and munc13-2 are localized mainly to cortical epithelial cells in rat kidney and both are overexpressed under conditions of hyperglycemia in a streptozotocin-treated diabetic rat model. Taken together, our data suggest that hmunc13 serves as a diacylglycerol-activated, PKC-independent signaling pathway capable of inducing apoptosis and that this pathway may contribute to the renal cell complications of hyperglycemia.
agouti - related	AGRP	Contribution of melanocortin receptor exoloops to Agouti-related protein binding. Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin action that functions in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. Although previous studies have shown that AGRP binds three of the five known subtypes of melanocortin receptor, the receptor domains participating in binding and the molecular interactions involved are presently unknown. The present studies were designed to examine the contribution of extracytoplasmic domains of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) to AGRP binding by making chimerical receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP) and the human MC4R (a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP). Substitutions of the extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus and the first extracytoplasmic loop (exoloop) of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R had no effect on AGRP (87-132) binding affinity or inhibitory activity (the ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation). In contrast, cassette substitutions of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with the homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a substantial loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Conversely, the exchange of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R was found to confer AGRP binding and inhibitory activity to the basic structure of the MC1R. Importantly, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7] melanocyte stimulating hormone to bind or activate the chimeric receptors. These data indicate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the melanocortin receptors are important for AGRP binding.

endoplasmic retic	ER	Targeting proteins to the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum using N-terminal domains of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and the 50-kDa esterase. Previous studies identified two intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, isozyme 1 (11beta-HSD) and the 50-kDa esterase (E3), sharing some amino acid sequence motifs in their N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domains. Both are type II membrane proteins with the C terminus projecting into the lumen of the ER. This finding implied that the N-terminal TM domains of 11beta-HSD and E3 may constitute a lumenal targeting signal (LTS). To investigate this hypothesis we created chimeric fusions using the putative targeting sequences and the reporter gene, Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein. Transfected COS cells expressing LTS-green fluorescent protein chimeras were examined by fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopic immunogold labeling. The orientation of expressed chimeras was established by immunocytofluorescent staining of selectively permeabilized COS cells. In addition, protease protection assays of membranes in the presence and absence of detergents was used to confirm lumenal or the cytosolic orientation of the constructed chimeras. To investigate the general applicability of the proposed LTS, we fused the N terminus of E3 to the N terminus of the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase lacking the myristoyl group and N-terminal 30-residue membrane anchor. The orientation of the cytochrome b5 reductase was reversed, from cytosolic to lumenal projection of the active domain. These observations establish that an amino acid sequence consisting of short basic or neutral residues at the N terminus, followed by a specific array of hydrophobic residues terminating with acidic residues, is sufficient for lumenal targeting of single-pass proteins that are structurally and functionally unrelated.

protein phosphatase	PP2A	A protein phosphatase methylesterase (PME-1) is one of several novel proteins stably associating with two inactive mutants of protein phosphatase 2A. Carboxymethylation of proteins is a highly conserved means of regulation in eukaryotic cells. The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic (C) subunit is reversibly methylated at its carboxyl terminus by specific methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes which have been purified, but not cloned. Carboxymethylation affects PP2A activity and varies during the cell cycle. Here, we report that substitution of glutamine for either of two putative active site histidines in the PP2A C subunit results in inactivation of PP2A and formation of stable complexes between PP2A and several cellular proteins. One of these cellular proteins, herein named protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), was purified and microsequenced, and its cDNA was cloned. PME-1 is conserved from yeast to human and contains a motif found in lipases having a catalytic triad-activated serine as their active site nucleophile. Bacterially expressed PME-1 demethylated PP2A C subunit in vitro, and okadaic acid, a known inhibitor of the PP2A methylesterase, inhibited this reaction. To our knowledge, PME-1 represents the first mammalian protein methylesterase to be cloned. Several lines of evidence indicate that, although there appears to be a role for C subunit carboxyl-terminal amino acids in PME-1 binding, amino acids other than those at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the C subunit also play an important role in PME-1 binding to a catalytically inactive mutant.

oxidative phosphory	OXPHOS	Up-regulation of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in the skeletal muscle of mice lacking the heart/muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator. Mice deficient in the heart/muscle specific isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT1) exhibit many of the hallmarks of human oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease, including a dramatic proliferation of skeletal muscle mitochondria. Because many of the genes necessary for mitochondrial biosynthesis, OXPHOS function, and response to OXPHOS disease might be expected to be up-regulated in the Ant1(-/-) mouse, we used differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction techniques in an effort to identify these genes. 17 genes were identified as up-regulated in Ant1-deficient mice, and they fall into four categories: 1) nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS components, 2) mitochondrial tRNA and rRNA genes, 3) genes involved in intermediary metabolism, and 4) an eclectic group of other genes. Among the latter genes, we identified the gene encoding anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, the Skd3 gene, and the WS-3 gene, which were previously unknown to be related to mitochondrial function. These results indicate that identification of genes up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of the Ant1-deficient mouse provides a novel method for identifying mammalian genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.
snrpn upstream reading	SNURF	An imprinted, mammalian bicistronic transcript encodes two independent proteins. Polycistronic transcripts are common in prokaryotes but rare in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis of the SNRPN (SmN) mRNA in five eutherian mammals reveals a second highly conserved coding sequence, termed SNURF (SNRPN upstream reading frame). The vast majority of nucleotide substitutions in SNURF occur in the wobble codon position, providing strong evolutionary evidence for selection for protein-coding function. Because SNURF-SNRPN maps to human chromosome 15q11-q13 and is paternally expressed, each cistron is a candidate for a role in the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and PWS mouse models. SNURF encodes a highly basic 71-aa protein that is nuclear-localized (as is SmN). Because SNURF is the only protein-coding sequence within the imprinting regulatory region in 15q11-q13, it may have provided the original selection for imprinting in this domain. Whereas some human tissues express a minor SNURF-only transcript, mouse tissues express only the bicistronic Snurf-Snrpn transcript. We show that both SNURF and SNRPN are translated in normal, but not PWS, human, and mouse tissues and cell lines. These findings identify SNURF as a protein that is produced along with SmN from a bicistronic transcript; polycistronic mRNAs therefore are encoded in mammalian genomes where they may form functional operons.

Because SNURF-SNRPN maps to human chromosome 15q11-q13 and is paternally expressed, each cistron is a candidate for a role in the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and PWS mouse models. SNURF encodes a highly basic 71-aa protein that is nuclear-localized (as is SmN). Because SNURF is the only protein-coding sequence within the imprinting regulatory region in 15q11-q13, it may have provided the original selection for imprinting in this domain. Whereas some human tissues express a minor SNURF-only transcript, mouse tissues express only the bicistronic Snurf-Snrpn transcript. We show that both SNURF and SNRPN are translated in normal, but not PWS, human, and mouse tissues and cell lines. These findings identify SNURF as a protein that is produced along with SmN from a bicistronic transcript; polycistronic mRNAs therefore are encoded in mammalian genomes where they may form functional operons.
camp - dependent protein kinase	PKA	Isolation and molecular characterization of AKAP110, a novel, sperm-specific protein kinase A-anchoring protein. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP are potent stimulators of sperm motility. Anchoring inhibitor peptides, designed to disrupt the interaction of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), are potent inhibitors of sperm motility. These data suggest that PKA anchoring is a key biochemical mechanism controlling motility. We now report the isolation, identification, cloning, and characterization of AKAP110, the predominant AKAP detected in sperm lysates. AKAP110 cDNA was isolated and sequenced from mouse, bovine, and human testis libraries. Using truncated mutants, the RII-binding domain was identified. Alignment of the RII-binding domain on AKAP110 to those from other AKAPs reveals that AKAPs contain eight functionally conserved positions within an amphipathic helix structure that are responsible for RII interaction. Northern analysis of eight different tissues detected AKAP110 only in the testis, and in situ hybridization analysis detected AKAP110 only in round spermatids, suggesting that AKAP110 is a protein found only in male germ cells. Sperm cells contain both RI, located primarily in the acrosomal region of the head, and RII, located exclusively in the tail, regulatory subunits of PKA. Immunocytochemical analysis detected AKAP110 in the acrosomal region of the sperm head and along the entire length of the principal piece. These data suggest that AKAP110 shares compartments with both RI and RII isoforms of PKA and may function as a regulator of both motility- and head-associated functions such as capacitation and the acrosome reaction.

human brain cholecystokininb	CCKBR	Direct identification of the agonist binding site in the human brain cholecystokininB receptor. In investigating the agonist binding site of the human brain cholecystokininB receptor (CCKBR), we employed the direct protein chemical approach using a photoreactive tritiated analogue of sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide, which contains the p-benzoylbenzoyl moiety at the N-terminus, followed by purification of the affinity-labeled receptor to homogeneity. This probe bound specifically, saturably, and with high affinity (KD = 1.2 nM) to the CCKBR and has full agonistic activity. As the starting material for receptor purification, we used stably transfected HEK 293 cells overexpressing functional CCKBR. Covalent labeling of the WGA-lectin-enriched receptor revealed a 70-80 kDa glycoprotein with a protein core of about 50 kDa. Identification of the agonist binding site was achieved by the application of subsequent chemical and enzymatical cleavage to the purified receptor. A radiolabeled peptide was identified by Edman degradation amino acid sequence analysis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The position of the radioactive probe within the identified peptide was determined using combined tandem electrospray mass spectrometry and peptide mapping. The probe was covalently attached within the sequence L52ELAIRITLY61 that represents the transition between the N-terminal domain and predicted transmembrane domain 1. Using this interaction as a constraint to orientate the ligand within the putative receptor binding site, a model of the CCK-8s-occupied CCKBR was constructed. The hormone was found to be placed in a binding pocket built from both extracellular and transmembrane domains of CCKBR with its N-terminus mainly interacting with residues Arg57 and Tyr61.
interleukin -	IL-12	Requirement for type 2 NO synthase for IL-12 signaling in innate immunity. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and type 2 NO synthase (NOS2) are crucial for defense against bacterial and parasitic pathogens, but their relationship in innate immunity is unknown. In the absence of NOS2 activity, IL-12 was unable to prevent spreading of Leishmania parasites, did not stimulate natural killer (NK) cells for cytotoxicity or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release, and failed to activate Tyk2 kinase and to tyrosine phosphorylate Stat4 (the central signal transducer of IL-12) in NK cells. Activation of Tyk2 in NK cells by IFN-alpha/beta also required NOS2. Thus, NOS2-derived NO is a prerequisite for cytokine signaling and function in innate immunity.

nucleotide excision	NER	Action of DNA repair endonuclease ERCC1/XPF in living cells. To study the nuclear organization and dynamics of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the endonuclease ERCC1/XPF (for excision repair cross complementation group 1/xeroderma pigmentosum group F) was tagged with green fluorescent protein and its mobility was monitored in living Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the absence of DNA damage, the complex moved freely through the nucleus, with a diffusion coefficient (15 +/- 5 square micrometers per second) consistent with its molecular size. Ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage caused a transient dose-dependent immobilization of ERCC1/XPF, likely due to engagement of the complex in a single repair event. After 4 minutes, the complex regained mobility. These results suggest (i) that NER operates by assembly of individual NER factors at sites of DNA damage rather than by preassembly of holocomplexes and (ii) that ERCC1/XPF participates in repair of DNA damage in a distributive fashion rather than by processive scanning of large genome segments.

vasodilator - stimulated phospho -	VASP	Integrin-mediated cell adhesion: the cytoskeletal connection. Members of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in the interaction between animal cells and the extracellular matrix. This article reviews the evidence (i) that the integrin beta-subunit cytoplasmic domain is important in the localization of integrins to focal adhesions, and for integrin-mediated cell adhesion/spreading; and (ii) that the integrin beta-subunit can be linked to F-actin via the actin-binding proteins talin, alpha-actinin and filamin. Talin has two or more actin-binding sites, and three binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin. Because vinculin can also bind F-actin, it may cross-link talin and actin, thereby stabilizing the interaction. In addition, vinculin contains a binding site for VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phospho-protein), a protein which may serve to recruit a profilin/G-actin complex to talin, which has actin-nucleating activity. Evidence that talin, vinculin and alpha-actinin are important in the assembly of focal adhesions, obtained using antisense technology and protein microinjection, is reviewed. To analyse the role of talin in focal adhesions, we have disrupted both copies of the talin gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Undifferentiated talin (-/-) ES cell mutants are unable to assemble focal adhesions when plated on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells are able to do so. Finally, the role of small GTP-binding proteins in the assembly of focal adhesions is discussed, along with our recent studies using streptolysin-O-permeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells which suggest that the GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF-1) is important in targeting the protein paxillin to focal adhesions.

jumping translo	JT	JTB: a novel membrane protein gene at 1q21 rearranged in a jumping translocation. 1q21 is frequently involved in different types of translocation in many types of cancers. Jumping translocation (JT) is an unbalanced translocation that comprises amplified chromosomal segments jumping to various telomeres. In this study, we identified a novel gene human JTB (Jumping Translocation Breakpoint) at 1q21, which fused with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case of JT. hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic species. JT results in a hJTB truncation, which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain. hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called EDC (Epidermal Differentiation Complex). This is the first report identifying the gene involved in unbalanced translocations at 1q21.

puromycin - sensitive aminopeptida	PSA	Cloning and analysis of the gene for the human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase. The gene encoding the human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) has been cloned and characterized. The human PSA gene is composed of 23 exons and 22 introns and spans approximately 40 kb of chromosome 17 at the interval 17q12-21. An analysis of the 5' end of the human PSA transcript reveals that the translational start site corresponds to nt 210 of the human PSA cDNA, as suggested by RT-PCR, 5' RACE, and computer analysis of expressed sequence tags. A comparison of the exon/exon boundaries of the human PSA gene with those of the human aminopeptidase N (APN) gene shows little conservation, suggesting that the two genes, which are closely related in protein sequence, diverged early during evolution.

adrenoleukodystrophy	ALDR	Full length cDNA cloning, promoter sequence, and genomic organization of the human adrenoleukodystrophy related (ALDR) gene functionally redundant to the gene responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a functional defect of the ALD Protein (ALDP), an ABC half-transporter localized in the peroxisomal membrane. It is characterized by defective, very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) beta-oxidation, resulting in progressive cerebral demyelination. Since individual mutations in the ALD gene may result in a variety of clinical phenotypes, the existence of modifying genetic factors has been proposed. The adrenoleukodystrophy related protein (ALDRP), a close homolog of ALDP, has been shown to complement the defect of VLCFA oxidation if transfected into X-ALD cells or chemically induced in ALDP-deficient mice. Chemical ALDRP induction holds a potential for a novel therapeutic strategy. We report here the exclusively peroxisomal localization of human ALDRP, the full length cDNA, the transcriptional start, and 2.4 kb of the putative promoter region DNA sequence. The human ALDR gene extends over 33 kb on chromosome 12q12 and consists of 10 exons. The gene structure is highly similar to the ALD gene, indicating a recent divergence from a common ancestor. The putative human promoter sequence contains a novel motif conserved in peroxisomal ABC transporters in the mouse. Our data will enable sequence analysis in X-ALD patients to determine a possible role of ALDRP as a modifier and provide tools for the study of therapeutic ALDRP induction.

yeast coat protein	COPII	A family of mammalian proteins homologous to yeast Sec24p. The Sec23p/Sec24p complex is a component of yeast coat protein II (COPII), the coat protein complex responsible for vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Database searches and molecular cloning reveal that four different mammalian Sec24p-like proteins exist, all with about 20% amino acid identity with the yeast Sec24p. Sec24A and Sec24B share about 50% amino acid identity. Sec24D is cloned by screening a human pancreas of cDNA library with an expressed sequence tag (EST) fragment that is homologous to, but distinct from, Sec24A and Sec24B. Sec24D shares about 50% amino acid identity with the gene product of KIAA0079, which we have designated as Sec24C. These mammalian Sec24s appear to form two subclasses based on homology. Sec24A/B and Sec24C/D share about 20% identity with each other and with the yeast Sec24p. The Sec24 sequences also share weak but significant homology to the mammalian Sec23A and Sec23B. Northern blot analysis revealed that Sec24C is ubiquitously expressed. Although Sec24D transcripts are detectable in all tissues examined, they are selectively enriched in certain tissues, particularly placenta and pancreas. myc-tagged Sec24C and sec24D colocalized with Sec13, another COPII component. This colocalization suggests that Sec24C and Sec24D are indeed associated with COPII structures on membranes of the ER-Golgi boundary. The existence of at least four forms of Sec24 in mammalian cells suggest that multiple forms of COPII complex may be involved in ER export.

hepatitis c	HCV	Hepatitis C virus core protein interacts with a human DEAD box protein DDX3. Several studies have implicated hepatitis C virus (HCV) core in influencing the expression of host genes. To identify cellular factors with a possible role in HCV replication and pathogenesis, we looked for cellular proteins that interact with the viral core protein. A human liver cDNA library was screened in a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify cellular proteins that bind to core. Several positive clones were isolated, one of which encoded the C-terminal 253 amino acids of a putative RNA helicase, a DEAD box protein designated DDX3. Bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase-DDX3 fusion protein specifically pulled down in vitro translated and radiolabeled HCV core, confirming a direct interaction. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells with a polyclonal antiserum showed that DDX3 is located predominantly in nuclear speckles and at low levels throughout the cytoplasm. In cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), DDX3 and core colocalized in distinct spots in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. The regions of the proteins involved in binding were found by deletion analysis to be the N-terminal 59 amino acid residues of core and a C-terminal RS-like domain of DDX3. The human DDX3 is a putative RNA helicase and a member of a highly conserved DEAD box subclass that includes murine PL10, Xenopus An3, and yeast Ded1 proteins. Their role in RNA metabolism or gene expression is unknown. The significance of core-helicase interaction in HCV replication and pathogenesis is discussed.
nuclear factor - kappa -	NF-kappaB	Nod1, an Apaf-1-like activator of caspase-9 and nuclear factor-kappaB. Ced-4 and Apaf-1 belong to a major class of apoptosis regulators that contain caspase-recruitment (CARD) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains. Nod1, a protein with an NH2-terminal CARD-linked to a nucleotide-binding domain and a COOH-terminal segment with multiple leucine-rich repeats, was identified. Nod-1 was found to bind to multiple caspases with long prodomains, but specifically activated caspase-9 and promoted caspase-9-induced apoptosis. As reported for Apaf-1, Nod1 required both the CARD and P-loop for function. Unlike Apaf-1, Nod1 induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappaB) and bound RICK, a CARD-containing kinase that also induces NF-kappaB activation. Nod1 mutants inhibited NF-kappaB activity induced by RICK, but not that resulting from tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. Thus, Nod1 is a leucine-rich repeat-containing Apaf-1-like molecule that can regulate both apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation pathways.
drosophila sex comb on mid	Scm	Identification of SCML2, a second human gene homologous to the Drosophila sex comb on midleg (Scm): A new gene cluster on Xp22. We have identified a novel gene with homologies to the Drosophila Sex comb on midleg (Scm) gene from the short arm of the X chromosome. Scm is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes, which encode transcriptional repressors essential for appropriate development in the fly and in mammals. The newly identified transcript named SCML2 (sex comb on midleg like-2, HGMW-approved symbol) is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a protein of 700 amino acids. SCML2 maps very close to the recently identified SCML1, revealing the presence of a new gene cluster in Xp22. The homology and map location identify SCML2 as a candidate gene for Xp22-linked developmental disorders, including the oral-facial-digital type I (OFDI) syndrome. A study of the SCML1-SCML2 cluster in primates indicates that the two genes are localized to the same region in Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and prosimians, suggesting that the duplication event leading to the formation of the SCML cluster on Xp22 occurred before primate divergence.

neuron - specific	NSP	Cloning of a novel member of the reticulon gene family (RTN3): gene structure and chromosomal localization to 11q13. A novel member of the neuron-specific protein (NSP) or newly named reticulon (RTN) gene family was isolated during a subtraction cloning between macula and peripheral retina. The mRNA for this NSP/RTN-like gene is approximately threefold more abundant in macula than in peripheral retina. The cDNA is 2527 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 236 amino acids. The deduced peptide shows a strong similarity to the NSP/RTN and tropomyosin-like gene families but it is clearly a novel member. The gene contains seven exons and spans more than 15 kb. The gene was localized to chromosome 11q13 between markers D11S4535 and D11S4627 using somatic cell hybrid panels. Southern blot analysis identified the presence of a pseudogene(s) that was subsequently localized to chromosome 4. Multitissue Northern blot analysis found this gene to be widely expressed in human tissues with the highest expression in the brain. We are calling this gene RTN3 to reflect the newly proposed nomenclature.

	ARF	Identification of centaurin-alpha1 as a potential in vivo phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein that is functionally homologous to the yeast ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase-activating protein, Gcs1. Centaurin-alpha is a 46 kDa in vitro binding protein for the lipid second messenger PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In this report we have addressed whether centaurin-alpha1, a human homologue of centaurin-alpha, binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vivo and furthermore, identified a potential physiological function for centaurin-alpha1. Using confocal microscopy of live PC12 cells, transiently transfected with a chimera of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminus of centaurin-alpha1 (GFP-centaurin-alpha1), we demonstrated the rapid plasma membrane recruitment of cytosolic GFP-centaurin-alpha1 following stimulation with either nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor. This recruitment was dependent on the centaurin-alpha1 pleckstrin homology domains and was blocked by the PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitors wortmannin (100 nM) and LY294002 (50 microM), and also by co-expression with a dominant negative p85. Functionally, we demonstrated that centaurin-alpha1 could complement a yeast strain deficient in the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase-activating protein Gcs1; a complementation that was blocked by mutagenesis of conserved cysteine residues within the ARF GTPase-activating protein analogous domain of centaurin-alpha1. Taken together, our data demonstrated that centaurin-alpha1 could potentially function as an ARF GTPase-activating protein that, on agonist stimulation, was recruited to the plasma membrane possibly through an ability to interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

short - chain dehydrogenase / reduc	SDR	Identification of peroxisomal proteins by using M13 phage protein VI phage display: molecular evidence that mammalian peroxisomes contain a 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. To elucidate unknown mammalian peroxisomal enzymes and functions, we subjected M13 phage expressing fusions between the gene encoding protein VI and a rat liver cDNA library to an immunoaffinity selection process in vitro (biopanning) with the use of antibodies raised against peroxisomal subfractions. In an initial series of biopanning experiments, four different cDNA clones were obtained. These cDNA species encoded two previously identified peroxisomal enzymes, catalase and urate oxidase, and two novel proteins that contained a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1). A primary structure analysis of these novel proteins revealed that one, ending in the tripeptide AKL, is homologous to the yeast peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34; DCR), an enzyme required for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, and that the other, ending in the tripeptide SRL, is a putative member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, with three isoforms. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions encoding GFP-DCR-AKL, GFP-DCR, GFP-SDR-SRL and GFP-SDR were expressed in mammalian cells. The analysis of the subcellular location of the recombinant fusion proteins confirmed the peroxisomal localization of GFP-DCR-AKL and GFP-SDR-SRL, as well as the functionality of the PTS1. That the AKL protein is indeed an NADPH-dependent DCR was demonstrated by showing DCR activity of the bacterially expressed protein. These results demonstrate at the molecular level that mammalian peroxisomes do indeed contain a DCR. In addition, the results presented here indicate that the protein VI display system is suitable for the isolation of rare cDNA clones from cDNA libraries and that this technology facilitates the identification of novel peroxisomal proteins.

rela - associated	RAI	Identification of a novel inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB, RelA-associated inhibitor. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel protein, RelA-associated inhibitor (RAI), that binds to the NF-kappaB subunit p65 (RelA) and inhibits its transcriptional activity. RAI gene was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the central region of p65 as bait. We confirmed the physical interaction in vitro using recombinant proteins as well as in vivo by immunoprecipitation/Western blot assay. RAI gene encodes a protein with homology to the C-terminal region of 53BP2 containing four consecutive ankyrin repeats and an Src homology 3 domain. RAI mRNA was preferentially expressed in human heart, placenta, and prostate. Despite its similarity to 53BP2, RAI did not interact with p53 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. RAI inhibited the action of NF-kappaB p65 but not that of p53 in transient luciferase gene expression assays. Similarly, RAI inhibited the endogenous NF-kappaB activity induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. RAI specifically inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65 when co-transfected in 293 cells. RAI protein appeared to be located in the nucleus and colocalized with NF-kappaB p65 that was activated by TNF-alpha. These observations indicate that RAI is another inhibitor of NF-kappaB in addition to IkappaB proteins and may confer an alternative mechanism of regulation.
None	TM	The interaction of thrombomodulin with Ca2+. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a cofactor for protein C activation by thrombin and each residue of a consensus Ca2+ site in the sixth epidermal growth factor domain (EGF6) is essential for this cofactor activity [Nagashima, M., Lundh, E., Leonard, J.C., Morser, J. & Parkinson, J.F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2888-2892]. Three soluble analogs of the extracellular domain of TM, solulin (Glu4-Pro490), TME1-6 (Cys227-Cys462) and TMEi4-6 (Val345-Cys462) were prepared for equilibrium dialysis experiments by exhaustive dialysis against Ca2+-depleted buffer. However, all three analogs still contained one tightly bound Ca2+ (Kd approximately 2 microm), which could only be removed by EDTA. Epitope mapping with Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibodies to EGF6 provided further localization of this tight Ca2+ site. Equilibrium dialysis of the soluble TM analogs in [45Ca2+] between 10 and 200 microm revealed a second Ca2+ site (Kd = 30 +/- 10 microm) in both solulin and TME1-6, but not in TMEi4-6. Ca2+ binding to this second site was unaffected by bound thrombin and we attribute it to the consensus Ca2+ site in EGF3. A 75-fold decrease in the binding affinity of thrombin to TM was observed with immobilized solulin treated with EDTA to remove the high affinity Ca2+ by measuring kassoc and kdiss rates in a BIAcoretrade mark instrument. Ca2+-dependent conformational transitions detected by CD spectroscopy in the far UV indicate a more ordered structure upon Ca2+ binding. Bound Ca2+ stabilized soluble TM against protease digestion at a trypsin-like protease-sensitive site between Arg456 and His457 in EGF6 compared with protease treatment in EDTA. Finally, TM containing EGF domains 4-6, but lacking the interdomain loop between EGF3 and 4 (TME4-6), has an identical Ca2+ dependence for the activation of protein C as found for TMEi4-6, indicating this interdomain loop is not involved in Ca2+ binding.
neighbor of cox	NOC4	The 5' region of the COX4 gene contains a novel overlapping gene, NOC4. We identified a novel human gene, NOC4 (Neighbor Of COX4), located 5' to COX4, the gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, on Chr 16q32-ter. Transcripts from this gene were identified among human expressed sequence tags. A full-length, 1.06-kb human retinal NOC4 cDNA encoded a 24-kDa, 210-amino acid hypothetical protein of unknown function. Northern hybridization analysis of human RNAs from various tissues detected NOC4 transcripts of 2.2 and 1.4 kb in all tissues examined, suggesting that NOC4 expression is ubiquitous. Transcription of both the COX4 and NOC4 genes initiates within a 250-bp intergenic promoter and occurs in opposite directions. The bidirectional promoter is G + C-rich, lacks TATA and CCAAT elements, and contains multiple potential binding sites for Sp1 and NRF-2/GABP. Two of the NRF-2/GABP sites are located within 14-bp direct repeats, a conserved feature of mammalian COX4 promoters. The NOC4 and COX4 genes are also linked in the rat, mouse, and bovine genomes. A NOC4-GFP fusion protein is located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, including the mitochondria.
large duplex	t loops	Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop. Mammalian telomeres contain a duplex array of telomeric repeats bound to the telomeric repeat-binding factors TRF1 and TRF2. Inhibition of TRF2 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends, manifested by loss of the telomeric 3' overhang, activation of p53, and end-to-end chromosome fusions. Electron microscopy reported here demonstrated that TRF2 can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding of TRF1 and single strand binding protein suggested that t loops are formed by invasion of the 3' telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. T loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and replication of telomeres.
manic	Mfng	Genomic structure, mapping, and expression analysis of the mammalian Lunatic, Manic, and Radical fringe genes. The three members of the mammalian fringe gene family, Manic fringe (Mfng), Radical fringe (Rfng), and Lunatic fringe (Lfng), were identified on the basis of their similarity to Drosophila fringe (fng) and their participation in the evolutionarily conserved Notch receptor signaling pathway. Fringe genes encode pioneer secretory proteins with weak similarity to glycosyltransferases. Both expression patterns and functional studies support an important role for Fringe genes in patterning during embryonic development and an association with cellular transformation. We have now further characterized the expression and determined the chromosomal localization and genomic structure of the mouse Mfng, Rfng, and Lfng genes; the genomic structure and conceptual open reading frame of the human RFNG gene; and the refined chromosomal localization of the three human fringe genes. The mouse Fringe genes are expressed in the embryo and in adult tissues. The mouse and human Fringe family members map to three different chromosomes in regions of conserved synteny: Mfng maps to mouse Chr 15, and MFNG maps to human Chr 22q13.1 in the region of two cancer-associated loci; Lfng maps to mouse Chr 5, and LFNG maps to human Chr 7p22; Rfng maps to mouse Chr 11, and RFNG maps to human Chr 17q25 in the minimal region for a familial psoriasis susceptibility locus. Characterization of the genomic loci of the Fringe gene family members reveals a conserved genomic organization of 8 exons. Comparative analysis of mammalian Fringe genomic organization suggests that the first exon is evolutionarily labile and that the Fringe genes have a genomic structure distinct from those of previously characterized glycosyltransferases.

The mouse and human Fringe family members map to three different chromosomes in regions of conserved synteny: Mfng maps to mouse Chr 15, and MFNG maps to human Chr 22q13.1 in the region of two cancer-associated loci; Lfng maps to mouse Chr 5, and LFNG maps to human Chr 7p22; Rfng maps to mouse Chr 11, and RFNG maps to human Chr 17q25 in the minimal region for a familial psoriasis susceptibility locus. Characterization of the genomic loci of the Fringe gene family members reveals a conserved genomic organization of 8 exons. Comparative analysis of mammalian Fringe genomic organization suggests that the first exon is evolutionarily labile and that the Fringe genes have a genomic structure distinct from those of previously characterized glycosyltransferases.
drosophila	fng	Genomic structure, mapping, and expression analysis of the mammalian Lunatic, Manic, and Radical fringe genes. The three members of the mammalian fringe gene family, Manic fringe (Mfng), Radical fringe (Rfng), and Lunatic fringe (Lfng), were identified on the basis of their similarity to Drosophila fringe (fng) and their participation in the evolutionarily conserved Notch receptor signaling pathway. Fringe genes encode pioneer secretory proteins with weak similarity to glycosyltransferases. Both expression patterns and functional studies support an important role for Fringe genes in patterning during embryonic development and an association with cellular transformation. We have now further characterized the expression and determined the chromosomal localization and genomic structure of the mouse Mfng, Rfng, and Lfng genes; the genomic structure and conceptual open reading frame of the human RFNG gene; and the refined chromosomal localization of the three human fringe genes.

distal mouse	Chr	The major brain isoform of kif1b lacks the putative mitochondria-binding domain. Kinesin and kinesin superfamily proteins are molecular motors involved in important intracellular functions such as organelle transport and cell division. They are microtubule-activated ATPases composed of a motor domain that binds to microtubules and a cargo-binding domain that binds to specific organelles. While searching for the slow Wallerian degeneration mutation (WldS) on distal mouse Chromosome (Chr) 4, we have identified a member of the kinesin superfamily whose predicted gene product has the N-terminal motor domain of Kif1b and a novel C-terminal cargo-binding domain homologous to Kif1a. Kif1b is responsible for the movement of mitochondria along the axon, but the novel isoform containing the alternative C-terminal domain is likely to have a different cargo-binding specificity. cDNA library screening and Northern blot analysis indicate that the alternatively spliced form of Kif1b containing the novel 3'end accounts for the most part of Kif1b expression. We also found more alternatively spliced exons that can give rise to heterogeneous transcripts. Therefore, alternative splicing, as well as multiple genes, may contribute to the selective movement of diverse organelles by anterograde axonal transport. Kif1b maps on distal mouse Chr 4, within the Wld genetic candidate interval, but outside the recently identified triplication. There is, however, no evidence that Kif1b is the Wld gene.
transforming growth factor -	TGF-beta	Defective angiogenesis in mice lacking endoglin. Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binding protein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Loss-of-function mutations in the human endoglin gene ENG cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1), a disease characterized by vascular malformations. Here it is shown that by gestational day 11.5, mice lacking endoglin die from defective vascular development. However, in contrast to mice lacking TGF-beta, vasculogenesis was unaffected. Loss of endoglin caused poor vascular smooth muscle development and arrested endothelial remodeling. These results demonstrate that endoglin is essential for angiogenesis and suggest a pathogenic mechanism for HHT1.
hexose - 6 - phosphate dehydro	H6PD	Human hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (glucose 1-dehydrogenase) encoded at 1p36: coding sequence and expression. Using the published protein sequence from a rabbit microsomal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone coding for its human equivalent, which is also known as hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) and glucose dehydrogenase. The corresponding genomic sequence is in the databases enabling its localization to chromosome 1p36. The gene spans 37 kb and consists of 5 exons, the fifth of which codes for more than half of the 89 kDa protein. The first intron is a 10 kb insertion in the 5' untranslated sequence. The predicted mRNA has an exceptionally long (6.5 kb) 3' untranslated sequence. The predicted protein shows extensive homology with X-linked G6PD, suggesting the two genes share a common ancestor but no intron positions are conserved between the two genes suggesting the gene duplication was an ancient event. The C-terminal portion of the protein is not homologous with G6PD but shows limited homology with proteins of unknown function found throughout evolution and encoded next to G6PD in various micro-organisms. Intriguingly this C-terminal portion has some homology with the N-terminal sequence of Plasmodium falciparum G6PD.
drosophila slit	sli	Distinct but overlapping expression patterns of two vertebrate slit homologs implies functional roles in CNS development and organogenesis. The Drosophila slit gene (sli) encodes a secreted leucine-rich repeat-containing protein (slit) expressed by the midline glial cells and required for normal neural development. A putative human sli homolog, SLIT1, has previously been identified by EST database scanning. We have isolated a second human sli homolog, SLIT2, and its murine homolog Slit2. Both SLIT1 and SLIT2 proteins show approximately 40% amino acid identity to slit and 60% identity to each other. In mice, both genes are expressed during CNS development in the floor plate, roof plate and developing motor neurons. As floor plate represents the vertebrate equivalent to the midline glial cells, we predict a conservation of function for these vertebrate homologs. Each gene shows additional but distinct sites of expression outside the CNS suggesting a variety of functions for these proteins.

formin homologue overexpressed in sp	FHOS	Identification and characterization of a protein containing formin homology (FH1/FH2) domains. A novel member of the Formin/Diaphanous family of proteins was cloned and characterized. A 4kB mRNA is ubiquitously expressed but is found in abundance in the spleen. FHOS (Formin Homologue Overexpressed in Spleen) contains a 3414bp open reading frame and encodes for an approximately 128kDa protein. FHOS has sequence homology to Diaphanous and Formin proteins within the Formin Homology (FH)1 and FH2 domains. FHOS also contains a coiled-coil, a collagen-like domain, two nuclear localization signals, and several potential PKC and PKA phosphorylation sites. FHOS-specific antiserum was generated and used to determine that FHOS is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein and is expressed in a variety of human cell lines. FHOS was mapped to chromosome 16q22 between framework markers WI-5594 and WI-9392.
germinal	GC	rC5a directs the in vitro migration of human memory and naive tonsillar B lymphocytes: implications for B cell trafficking in secondary lymphoid tissues. Human C5a is a potent chemoattractant for granulocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. In mice C5a has been shown to be chemotactic for germinal center (GC) B cells. To date, no information is available on the effects of C5a on human B cell locomotion. Here we demonstrate that rC5a increases polarization and migration of human tonsillar B cells. The locomotory response was due to both chemokinetic and chemotactic activities of rC5a. Moreover, memory and, at a lesser extent, naive B cell fractions from purified tonsillar populations displayed rC5a-enhanced migratory properties, whereas GC cells did not. Flow cytometry revealed C5aR (CD88) on approximately 40% memory and 10% naive cells, respectively, whereas GC cells were negative. Immunohistochemistry showed that a few CD88+ cells were of the B cell lineage and localized in tonsillar subepithelial areas, where the majority of memory B cells settle. Pretreatment of memory B cells with the CD88 mAb abolished their migratory responsiveness to rC5a. Finally, the C5 gene was found to be expressed in naive, GC, and memory B lymphocytes at both the mRNA and the protein level. This study delineates a novel role for C5a as a regulator of the trafficking of human memory and naive B lymphocytes and supports the hypothesis that the B cells themselves may serve as source of C5 in secondary lymphoid tissues.
hypoxia - inducible factor -	HIF-1	The tumour suppressor protein VHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors for oxygen-dependent proteolysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits. Thus, constitutive HIF-1 activation may underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumours. The pVHL/HIF-1 interaction provides a new focus for understanding cellular oxygen sensing.

thrombospondin motifs -	ADAMTS-4	Purification and cloning of aggrecanase-1: a member of the ADAMTS family of proteins. We purified, cloned, and expressed aggrecanase, a protease that is thought to be responsible for the degradation of cartilage aggrecan in arthritic diseases. Aggrecanase-1 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS-4)] is a member of the ADAMTS protein family that cleaves aggrecan at the glutamic acid-373-alanine-374 bond. The identification of this protease provides a specific target for the development of therapeutics to prevent cartilage degradation in arthritis.
myosin light chain	MLCK	ZIP kinase identified as a novel myosin regulatory light chain kinase in HeLa cells. A novel myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) cDNA was isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to that of a zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) which mediates apoptosis [Kawai et al. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 1642-1651]. Here we found that HeLa ZIPK phosphorylated the regulatory light chain of myosin II (MRLC) at both serine 19 and threonine 18 in a Ca2+/calmodulin independent manner. Phosphorylation of myosin II by HeLa ZIPK resulted in activation of actin-activated MgATPase activity of myosin II. HeLa ZIPK is the first non-muscle MLCK that phosphorylates MRLC at two sites.

None	EMILIN	EMILIN, a component of the elastic fiber and a new member of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor superfamily of proteins. EMILIN (elastin microfibril interface located protein) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein abundantly expressed in elastin-rich tissues such as blood vessels, skin, heart, and lung. It occurs associated with elastic fibers at the interface between amorphous elastin and microfibrils. Avian EMILIN was extracted from 19-day-old embryonic chick aortas and associated blood vessels and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Tryptic peptides were generated from EMILIN and sequenced, and degenerate inosine-containing oligonucleotide primers were designed from some peptides. A set of primers allowed the amplification of a 360-base pair reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction product from chick aorta mRNA. A probe based on a human homologue selected by comparison of the chick sequence with EST data base was used to select overlapping clones from both human aorta and kidney cDNA libraries. Here we present the cDNA sequence of the entire coding region of human EMILIN encompassing an open reading frame of 1016 amino acid residues. There was a high degree of homology (76% identity and 88% similarity) between the chick C terminus and the human sequence as well as between the N terminus of the mature chick protein where 10 of 12 residues, as determined by N-terminal sequencing, were identical or similar to the deduced N terminus of human EMILIN. The domain organization of human EMILIN includes a C1q-like globular domain at the C terminus, a collagenous stalk, and a longer segment in which at least four heptad repeats and a leucine zipper can be identified with a high potential for forming coiled-coil alpha helices. At the N terminus there is a cysteine-rich sequence stretch similar to a region of multimerin, a platelet and endothelial cell component, containing a partial epidermal growth factor-like motif. The native state of the recombinantly expressed EMILIN C1q-like domain to be used in cell adhesion was determined by CD spectra analysis, which indicated a high value of beta-sheet conformation. The EMILIN C1q-like domain promoted a high cell adhesion of the leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1, whereas the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was negative.
nucleoporin - like protein	NLP-1	A new nucleoporin-like protein interacts with both HIV-1 Rev nuclear export signal and CRM-1. The HIV-1 Rev is a shuttling protein required for the nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNA. In this study, we have identified a new Rev-interacting protein, that specifically interacts with the Rev nuclear export signal both in yeast and mammalian cells. This protein has features found in nucleoporins including many phenylalanine-glycine repeats, a very high serine content, a putative zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain; we thus called it NLP-1 (nucleoporin-like protein 1). In addition, gene expression analysis and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography experiments suggested that NLP-1 is an ubiquitous O-glycosylated nuclear protein. Recently, a cellular factor called CRM-1 has been shown to be an essential nuclear export factor interacting directly with nuclear export signals including the Rev nuclear export signal in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We show here that NLP-1, like the previously described Rev-interacting protein hRIP/Rab and several nucleoporins, also interacts with CRM-1 both in yeast and mammalian cells.
x - linked lymphoproliferative	XLP	Cutting edge: human 2B4, an activating NK cell receptor, recruits the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and the adaptor signaling protein SAP. The genetic defect in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein SAP. SAP constitutively associates with the cell surface molecule, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), and competes with SH2-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) for recruitment to SLAM. SLAM exhibits homology with the mouse cell surface receptor 2B4. The human homologue of 2B4 has now been identified. It is recognized by the c1.7 mAb, a mAb capable of activating human NK cells. Human 2B4 became tyrosine phosphorylated following pervanadate-treatment of transfected cells and recruited SHP-2. SAP was also recruited to 2B4 in activated cells. Importantly, the 2B4-SAP interaction prevented the association between 2B4 and SHP-2. These results suggest that the phenotype of XLP may result from perturbed signaling not only through SLAM, but also other cell surface molecules that utilize SAP as a signaling adaptor protein.

glycoprotein	gp120	Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activation blocks the down-regulation of CXC chemokine receptor 4 by HIV-1 gp120 in CD4+ T cells. Because the binding of HIV-1 envelope to CD4 initiates a configurational change in glycoprotein 120 (gp120), enabling it to interact with fusion coreceptors, we investigated how this process interferes with the expression and function of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in CD4+ T lymphocytes. A recombinant gp120 (MN), after preincubation with CD4+ T lymphocytes, significantly inhibited the binding and chemotaxis of the cells in response to the CXCR4 ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), accompanied by a markedly reduced surface expression of CXCR4. gp120, but not SDF-1alpha, induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of src-like kinase p56lck in CD4+ T cells, whereas both gp120 and SDF-1alpha caused phosphorylation of the CXCR4. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A abolished the phosphorylation of p56lck and CXCR4 induced by gp120 in association with maintenance of normal expression of cell surface CXCR4 and a migratory response to SDF-1alpha. Thus, a CD4-associated signaling molecule(s) including p56lck is activated by gp120 and is required for the down-regulation of CXCR4.

membrane -	MT	Identification and characterization of human MT5-MMP, a new membrane-bound activator of progelatinase a overexpressed in brain tumors. A cDNA encoding a new member of the membrane-type (MT) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family has been identified and cloned from a human brain cDNA library. The isolated cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 645 amino acids that displays a similar domain organization as other MMPs, including a predomain with the activation locus, a zinc-binding site, and a hemopexin domain. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a COOH-terminal extension, rich in hydrophobic residues and similar in size to the equivalent domains identified in MT-MMPs. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA revealed that the encoded protein is localized in the plasma membrane. On the basis of these features, this novel human MMP has been called MT5-MMP because it represents the fifth member of the MT-MMP subfamily of MMPs. Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments showed that the human MT5-MMP gene (MMP-24) maps to 20q11.2, a region frequently amplified in tumors from diverse sources. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that MT5-MMP is predominantly expressed in brain, kidney, pancreas, and lung. In addition, MT5-MMP transcripts were detected at high levels compared to normal brain tissue in a series of brain tumors, including astrocytomas and glioblastomas. The catalytic domain of MT5-MMP, produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, exhibits a potent proteolytic activity against progelatinase A, leading to the generation of the Mr 62,000 active form of this enzyme. These data suggest that MT5-MMP may contribute to the activation of progelatinase A in tumor tissues, in which it is overexpressed, thereby facilitating tumor progression.

yeast exonuclease	Exo1	Human exonuclease 1 functionally complements its yeast homologues in DNA recombination, RNA primer removal, and mutation avoidance. Yeast exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is induced during meiosis and plays an important role in DNA homologous recombination and mismatch correction pathways. The human homolog, an 803-amino acid protein, shares 55% similarity to the yeast Exo1. In this report, we show that the enzyme functionally complements Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo1 in recombination of direct repeat DNA fragments, UV resistance, and mutation avoidance by in vivo assays. Furthermore, the human enzyme suppresses the conditional lethality of a rad27Delta mutant, symptomatic of defective RNA primer removal. The purified recombinant enzyme not only displays 5'-3' double strand DNA exonuclease activity, but also shows an RNase H activity. This result indicates a back-up function of exonuclease 1 to flap endonuclease-1 in RNA primer removal during lagging strand DNA synthesis.
human tfiiaalpha / beta - like	ALF	Identification of a general transcription factor TFIIAalpha/beta homolog selectively expressed in testis. In this paper we describe the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a human TFIIAalpha/beta-like factor (ALF). The open reading frame of ALF predicts a protein of 478 amino acids that contains characteristic N- and C-terminal conserved domains separated by an internal nonconserved domain. In addition, a rare ALF-containing cDNA, which possesses an extended N terminus (Stoned B/TFIIAalpha/beta-like factor; SALF) has also been identified. The results of Northern and dot blot analyses show that ALF is expressed almost exclusively in testis; in contrast, TFIIAalpha/beta and TFIIAgamma are enriched in testis but are also widely expressed in other human tissues. Recombinant ALF (69 kDa) and TFIIAgamma (12 kDa) polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli form an ALF/gamma complex that can stabilize TBP-TATA interactions in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The ALF/gamma complex is also able to restore transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter using HeLa cell nuclear extracts that have been depleted of TFIIA. Overall, the data show that ALF is a functional homolog of human general transcription factor TFIIAalpha/beta that may be uniquely important to testis biology.
eukaryotic parvulin homo	EPVH	Identification of eukaryotic parvulin homologues: a new subfamily of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases. We report here the existence of a subfamily of eukaryotic parvulin proteins that have strong sequence homology with E. coli parvulin, but lack the WW domain found in previously described eukarytoic parvulins. We hence term members of this subfamily EPVH (eukaryotic parvulin homologue). We describe the characterisation of hEPVH (human eukaryotic parvulin homologue). Immunogold labelling transmission electron microscopy reveals that hEPVH is preferentially localised in the mitochondrial matrix. The homology of hEPVH with its prokaryotic ancestor supports the hypothesis that this protein may have a mitochondrial function. An essential role in this organelle may explain the need for a high degree of conservation of this protein between distantly related species.

multiple epiphyseal dyspl	MED	Identification of novel pro-alpha2(IX) collagen gene mutations in two families with distinctive oligo-epiphyseal forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with marked clinical and radiographic variability. Traditionally, the mild " Ribbing " and severe " Fairbank " types have been used to define a broad phenotypic spectrum. Mutations in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric-matrix protein have been shown to result in several types of MED, whereas mutations in the gene encoding the alpha2 chain of type IX collagen (COL9A2) have so far been found only in two families with the Fairbank type of MED. Type IX collagen is a heterotrimer of pro-alpha chains derived from three distinct genes-COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3. In this article, we describe two families with distinctive oligo-epiphyseal forms of MED, which are heterozygous for different mutations in the COL9A2 exon 3/intron 3 splice-donor site. Both of these mutations result in the skipping of exon 3 from COL9A2 mRNA, but the position of the mutation in the splice-donor site determines the stability of the mRNA produced from the mutant COL9A2 allele.
n - methyl - d - aspartate	NMDARs	Specific coupling of NMDA receptor activation to nitric oxide neurotoxicity by PSD-95 protein. The efficiency with which N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) trigger intracellular signaling pathways governs neuronal plasticity, development, senescence, and disease. In cultured cortical neurons, suppressing the expression of the NMDAR scaffolding protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95) selectively attenuated excitotoxicity triggered via NMDARs, but not by other glutamate or calcium ion (Ca2+) channels. NMDAR function was unaffected, because receptor expression, NMDA currents, and 45Ca2+ loading were unchanged. Suppressing PSD-95 blocked Ca2+-activated nitric oxide production by NMDARs selectively, without affecting neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression or function. Thus, PSD-95 is required for efficient coupling of NMDAR activity to nitric oxide toxicity, and imparts specificity to excitotoxic Ca2+ signaling.

immunoglobulin	IgD	Mutations in MVK, encoding mevalonate kinase, cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome. Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS; MIM 260920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated with lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, gastrointestinal dismay and skin rash. Diagnostic hallmark of HIDS is a constitutively elevated level of serum immunoglobulin D (IgD), although patients have been reported with normal IgD levels. To determine the underlying defect in HIDS, we analysed urine of several patients and discovered increased concentrations of mevalonic acid during severe episodes of fever, but not between crises. Subsequent analysis of cells from four unrelated HIDS patients revealed reduced activities of mevalonate kinase (MK; encoded by the gene MVK), a key enzyme of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Sequence analysis of MVK cDNA from the patients identified three different mutations, one of which was common to all patients. Expression of the mutant cDNAs in Escherichia coli showed that all three mutations affect the activity of the encoded proteins. Moreover, immunoblot analysis demonstrated a deficiency of MK protein in patient fibroblasts, indicating a protein-destabilizing effect of the mutations.

holoprosencepha	HPE	Mutations in the homeodomain of the human SIX3 gene cause holoprosencephaly. Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common, severe malformation of the brain that involves separation of the central nervous system into left and right halves. Mild HPE can consist of signs such as a single central incisor, hypotelorism, microcephaly, or other craniofacial findings that can be present with or without associated brain malformations. The aetiology of HPE is extremely heterogeneous, with the proposed participation of a minimum of 12 HPE-associated genetic loci as well as the causal involvement of specific teratogens acting at the earliest stages of neurulation. The HPE2 locus was recently characterized as a 1-Mb interval on human chromosome 2p21 that contained a gene associated with HPE. A minimal critical region was defined by a set of six overlapping deletions and three clustered translocations in HPE patients. We describe here the isolation and characterization of the human homeobox-containing SIX3 gene from the HPE2 minimal critical region (MCR). We show that at least 2 of the HPE-associated translocation breakpoints in 2p21 are less than 200 kb from the 5' end of SIX3. Mutational analysis has identified four different mutations in the homeodomain of SIX3 that are predicted to interfere with transcriptional activation and are associated with HPE. We propose that SIX3 is the HPE2 gene, essential for the development of the anterior neural plate and eye in humans.

malattia leventines	ML	A single EFEMP1 mutation associated with both Malattia Leventinese and Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy. Malattia Leventinese (ML) and Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) refer to two autosomal dominant diseases characterized by yellow-white deposits known as drusen that accumulate beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Both loci were mapped to chromosome 2p16-21 (refs 5,6) and this genetic interval has been subsequently narrowed. The importance of these diseases is due in large part to their close phenotypic similarity to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disorder with a strong genetic component that accounts for approximately 50% of registered blindness in the Western world. Just as in ML and DHRD, the early hallmark of AMD is the presence of drusen. Here we use a combination of positional and candidate gene methods to identify a single non-conservative mutation (Arg345Trp) in the gene EFEMP1 (for EGF-containing fibrillin-like extracellular matrix protein 1) in all families studied. This change was not present in 477 control individuals or in 494 patients with age-related macular degeneration. Identification of this mutation may aid in the development of an animal model for drusen, as well as in the identification of other genes involved in human macular degeneration.

pleckstrin homo	PH	APS, an adaptor protein containing Pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src homology-2 (SH2) domains inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway in collaboration with c-Cbl. We cloned a novel adaptor protein, APS (adaptor molecule containing Pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src Homology-2 (SH2) domains), which was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to c-kit or B cell receptor stimulation. Here, we report that APS was tyrosine phosphorylated by Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) at its C-terminal tyrosine residue and interacted with c-Cbl. Forced expression of APS in an erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent hematopoietic cell line resulted in reduced activation of STAT5 but not cell proliferation in response to EPO. APS bound to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue, Y343 of the erythropoietin receptor cytoplasmic domain. Co-expression of APS and c-Cbl, but not expression of either alone inhibited EPO-dependent STAT5 activation in 293 cells. This required the C-terminal phosphorylation site, as well as PH and SH2 domains of APS. Therefore, one of the major functions of APS is in recruitment of c-Cbl into the receptor/JAK complex, thereby inhibiting JAK signaling activity.

None	pilin	Identification, expression and chromosome localization of a human gene encoding a novel protein with similarity to the pilB family of transcriptional factors (pilin) and to bacterial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases. Here we report the isolation, characterization and chromosome localization of a subtracted cDNA (CBS-1) isolated from the human ocular ciliary body which encodes a novel protein. As is deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, CBS-1 contains an open reading frame consisting of 182 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 19.5kDa. CBS-1 shares significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities (residues 51 to 182) with a hypothetical 15.5kDa protein in the ANSA-GAP intergenic region (yeaA) of Escherichia coli, and the carboxyl terminal region of pilB, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of expression of pili, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Interestingly, CBS-1 also shares significant identity with the carboxyl terminus of the peptide-methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), a repair enzyme, from Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the amino terminal of CBS-1 (residues 23 to 43), which lacks homology to the amino terminal region of gonococcal pilB or pneumococcal MsrA, exhibits significant identity in a stretch of 20 amino acids, with glycine-rich proteins. By Northern blot, CBS-1, hybridized to a 0.6 to 0.7kb transcript in size, is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, but most abundantly in the retina and ocular ciliary body, skeletal muscle and heart. An epitope-directed antibody to an amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus of CBS-1 recognized a main protein of 19.5kDa in ocular ciliary body extracts, and a 23kDa protein in total extracts from E. coli MC1061 cells, which expresses high levels of MsrA. The CBS-1 gene was mapped to human chromosome 10p12 between markers WI-8535 and WI-4724, and is tightly linked to the two STRP markers of D10S1789 and D10S550. We suggest that the CBS-1 gene encodes a mammalian transcription factor related to the bacterial pilB and certain bacterial MsrA homologues.

endothelial nitric oxide synth	eNOS	Regulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide production by the protein kinase Akt. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is the nitric oxide synthase isoform responsible for maintaining systemic blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. eNOS is phosphorylated in response to various forms of cellular stimulation, but the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and the kinase(s) responsible are not known. Here we show that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B) can directly phosphorylate eNOS on serine 1179 and activate the enzyme, leading to NO production, whereas mutant eNOS (S1179A) is resistant to phosphorylation and activation by Akt. Moreover, using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, activated Akt increases basal NO release from endothelial cells, and activation-deficient Akt attenuates NO production stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor. Thus, eNOS is a newly described Akt substrate linking signal transduction by Akt to the release of the gaseous second messenger NO.

nitric	NO	Activation of nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells by Akt-dependent phosphorylation. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a fundamental determinant of cardiovascular homesotasis: it regulates systemic blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Physiologically, the most important stimulus for the continuous formation of NO is the viscous drag (shear stress) generated by the streaming blood on the endothelial layer. Although shear-stress-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS is thought to regulate enzyme activity, the mechanism of activation of eNOS is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB mediates the activation of eNOS, leading to increased NO production. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt pathway or mutation of the Akt site on eNOS protein (at serine 1177) attenuates the serine phosphorylation and prevents the activation of eNOS. Mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser 1177 directly enhances enzyme activity and alters the sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+, rendering its activity maximal at sub-physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Thus, phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt represents a novel Ca2+-independent regulatory mechanism for activation of eNOS.

paired	Prd domain	Structural defects of a Pax8 mutant that give rise to congenital hypothyroidism. Pax proteins are transcriptional regulators that play important roles during embryogenesis. These proteins recognize specific DNA sequences via a conserved element: the paired domain (Prd domain). The low level of organized secondary structure, in the free state, is a general feature of Prd domains; however, these proteins undergo a dramatic gain in alpha-helical content upon interaction with DNA ('induced fit'). Pax8 is expressed in the developing thyroid, kidney and several areas of the central nervous system. In humans, mutations of the Pax8 gene, which are mapped to the coding region of the Prd domain, give rise to congenital hypothyroidism. Here, we have investigated the molecular defects caused by a mutation in which leucine at position 62 is substituted for an arginine. Leu62 is conserved among Prd domains, and contributes towards the packing together of helices 1 and 3. The binding affinity of the Leu62Arg mutant for a specific DNA sequence (the C sequence of thyroglobulin promoter) is decreased 60-fold with respect to the wild-type Pax8 Prd domain. However, the affinities with which the wild-type and the mutant proteins bind to a non-specific DNA sequence are very similar. CD spectra demonstrate that, in the absence of DNA, both wild-type Pax8 and the Leu62Arg mutant possess a low alpha-helical content; however, in the Leu62Arg mutant, the gain in alpha-helical content upon interaction with DNA is greatly reduced with respect to the wild-type protein. Thus the molecular defect of the Leu62Arg mutant causes a reduced capability for induced fit upon DNA interaction.
prostagland	PG	Identification of human prostaglandin E synthase: a microsomal, glutathione-dependent, inducible enzyme, constituting a potential novel drug target. Human prostaglandin (PG) E synthase (EC 5.3.99.3) is a member of a recently recognized protein superfamily consisting of membrane associated proteins involved in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (the MAPEG family). Previous designations of the protein are PIG12 and MGST1-L1. PGE synthase was expressed in Escherichia coli, and both cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared. Western blot analysis specifically detected a 15- to 16-kDa protein in the membrane fraction. Both fractions were incubated with prostaglandin H2 in the presence or absence of reduced glutathione. The membrane but not the cytosolic fraction was found to possess high glutathione-dependent PGE synthase activity (0.25 micromol/min/mg). The human tissue distribution was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. High expression of PGE synthase mRNA was detected in A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines. Intermediate level of expression was demonstrated in placenta, prostate, testis, mammary gland, and bladder whereas low mRNA expression was observed in several other tissues. A549 cells have been used as a model system to study cyclooxygenase-2 induction by IL-1beta. If A549 cells were grown in the presence of IL-1beta, a significant induction of the PGE synthase was observed by Western blot analysis. Also, Western blot analysis specifically detected a 16-kDa protein in sheep seminal vesicles. In summary, we have identified a human membrane bound PGE synthase. The enzyme activity is glutathione-dependent, and the protein expression is induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. PGE synthase is a potential novel target for drug development.
None	CPA3	Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3): a novel gene highly induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors during differentiation of prostate epithelial cancer cells. Butyrate and its structural analogues have recently entered clinical trials as a potential drug for differentiation therapy of advanced prostate cancer. To better understand the molecular mechanism(s) involved in prostate cancer differentiation, we used mRNA differential display to identify the gene(s) induced by butyrate. We found that the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3 undergoes terminal differentiation and apoptosis after treatment with sodium butyrate (NaBu). A novel cDNA designated carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), which was up-regulated in NaBu-treated PC-3 cells, was identified and characterized. This gene expresses a 2795-bp mRNA encoding a protein with an open reading frame of 421 amino acids. CPA3 has 37-63% amino acid identity with zinc CPs from different mammalian species. It also shares 27-43% amino acid similarity with zinc CPs from several nonmammalian species, including Escherichia coli, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila. The structural similarity between CPA3 and its closest homologues indicates that the putative CPA3 protein contains a 16-residue signal peptide sequence, a 95-residue NH2-terminal activation segment, and a 310-residue CP enzyme domain. The consistent induction of CPA3 by NaBu in several prostate cancer cell lines led us to investigate the signaling pathway involved in the induction of CPA3 mRNA. Trichostatin A, a potent and specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, also induced CPA3 mRNA expression, suggesting that CPA3 gene induction is mediated by histone hyperacetylation. We demonstrated that CPA3 induction was a downstream effect of the treatment with butyrate or trichostatin A, but that the induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) occurred immediately after these treatments. We also demonstrated that the induction of CPA3 mRNA by NaBu was inhibited by p21(WAF1/CIP1) antisense mRNA expression, indicating that p21 transactivation is required for the induction of CPA3 by NaBu. Our data demonstrate that the histone hyperacetylation signaling pathway is activated during NaBu-mediated differentiation of PC-3 cells, and the new gene, CPA3, is involved in this pathway.

src homology	SH3	Possible involvement of a novel STAM-associated molecule " AMSH " in intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines. STAM containing an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif was previously revealed to be implicated in signaling pathways immediately downstream of Jak2 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases associated with cytokine receptors. We molecularly cloned a novel molecule interacting with the SH3 domain of STAM, which was named AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). AMSH contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and a homologous region of a c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) subdomain in addition to a binding site for the SH3 domain of STAM. AMSH mutant deleted of the C-terminal half conferred dominant negative effects on signaling for DNA synthesis and c-myc induction mediated by interleukin 2 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. These results suggest that AMSH plays a critical role in the cytokine-mediated intracellular signal transduction downstream of the Jak2/Jak3.STAM complex.

	aa	Characterization of DP103, a novel DEAD box protein that binds to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear proteins EBNA2 and EBNA3C. The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA2 and EBNA3C both interact with the cellular transcription factor RBP-Jkappa and modulate the expression of several shared target genes, suggesting a tight cooperation in latently infected cells. In a survey for additional cellular factors that bind to EBNA2 as well as EBNA3C, we have isolated and characterized DP103, a novel human member of the DEAD box family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. The interaction with DP103 is mediated by amino acids (aa) 121-213 of EBNA2 and aa 534-778 of EBNA3C, regions that are not involved in binding of the viral proteins to RBP-Jkappa. The DP103-cDNA encodes a protein of 824 aa that harbors all of the common DEAD box motifs. Monoclonal antibodies raised against DP103 detect a protein of 103 kDa in mammalian cells that resides in high molecular weight complexes in vivo. We have detected an ATPase activity intrinsic to or closely associated with DP103. By subcellular fractionation, we find DP103 in both a soluble nuclear fraction as well as in the insoluble skeletal fraction. Whereas the protein and its mRNA are uniformly expressed in all tested cell lines, we observed differential expression of the mRNA in normal human tissues.
mitochondrial acyl - coa thioesterase of 48 k	MT-ACT48	Molecular cloning and characterization of MT-ACT48, a novel mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase. While characterizing Eps15 partners, we identified a 48-kDa polypeptide (p48) which was precipitated by Eps15-derived glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. A search in a murine expressed sequence tag data base with N-terminal microsequences of p48 led to the identification of two complete cDNA clones encoding two isoforms of a 439-amino acid protein sharing 95% nucleic and amino acid identity. Northern blot and immunoblotting studies showed that p48 was ubiquitously expressed. A significant homology (19% identity and 40% similarity) between p48 and rat brain cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase was observed in an 80-amino acid C-terminal domain, retrieved from proteins from human, nematode, and plants. The thioesterase function of p48 was further demonstrated against long chain acyl-CoAs in a spectrophotometric assay. Furthermore, data obtained from sequence analysis showed that p48 contained a mitochondrial targeting signal, cleaved in mature protein as assessed by microsequencing. The mitochondrial localization of both endogenous and transfected p48 was confirmed by confocal microscopy. These results indicate that p48, called MT-ACT48 (mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase of 48 kDa), defines a novel family of mitochondrial long chain acyl-CoA thioesterases.
interleukin - 1 receptor - associated	IRAK	IRAK-M is a novel member of the Pelle/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) was first described as a signal transducer for interleukin-1 (IL-1) and has later been implicated in signal transduction of other members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family. We now report the identification and characterization of a novel IRAK-like molecule. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IRAK and IRAK-2, this new IRAK-like molecule is found mainly in cells of monomyeloic origin and is, therefore, designated IRAK-M. Although IRAK-M and IRAK-2 exhibit only a negligible autophosphorylation activity, they can reconstitute the IL-1 response in a 293 mutant cell line lacking IRAK. In addition, we show for the first time that members of the IRAK family are indispensable elements of lipopolysaccharide signal transduction. The discovery of IRAK-M adds another level of complexity to our understanding of signaling by members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family.

receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase	RPTPkappa	A soluble version of the receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa stimulates neurite outgrowth via a Grb2/MEK1-dependent signaling cascade. Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa (RPTPkappa) is expressed in the nervous system in a manner consistent with a role in axonal growth and guidance. The extracellular domain of RPTPkappa shares structural features with cell adhesion molecules and can support homophilic adhesion. In the present study we produced a soluble Fc-chimeric protein containing the full extracellular domain of RPTPkappa. Following affinity capture, the RPTPkappa-Fc was shown to promote the aggregation of Covasphere beads, confirming its homophilic binding activity. When added to cultures of cerebellar neurons as a soluble molecule, the RPTPkappa chimera stimulated neurite outgrowth. The neurite outgrowth response was substantially inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of Grb2 and by PD 098059, a drug that has been used to inhibit MEK1 activation in a wide range of cell types. These results demonstrate that RPTPkappa can stimulate neurite outgrowth and provide evidence that this might involve the coupling of Grb2 to a MAPK signal transduction cascade.
None	AFB1	cDNA cloning, expression and activity of a second human aflatoxin B1-metabolizing member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, AKR7A3. The aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) aldehyde metabolite of AFB1 may contribute to the cytotoxicity of this hepatocarcinogen via protein adduction. Aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductases, specifically the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductases of rat (AKR7A1) and human (AKR7A2), are known to metabolize the AFB1 dihydrodiol by forming AFB1 dialcohol. Using a rat AKR7A1 cDNA, we isolated and characterized a distinct aldo-keto reductase (AKR7A3) from an adult human liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of AKR7A3 shares 80 and 88% identity with rat AKR7A1 and human AKR7A2, respectively. Recombinant rat AKR7A1 and human AKR7A3 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as hexa-histidine tagged fusion proteins. These proteins catalyzed the reduction of several model carbonyl-containing substrates. The NADPH-dependent formation of AFB1 dialcohol by recombinant human AKR7A3 was confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced using recombinant rat AKR7A1 protein were shown to detect nanogram amounts of rat and human AKR7A protein. The amount of AKR7A-related protein in hepatic cytosols of 1, 2-dithiole-3-thione-treated rats was 18-fold greater than in cytosols from untreated animals. These antibodies detected AKR7A-related protein in normal human liver samples ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 microg/mg cytosolic protein. Northern blot analysis showed varying levels of expression of AKR7A RNA in human liver and in several extrahepatic tissues, with relatively high levels in the stomach, pancreas, kidney and liver. Based on the kinetic parameters determined using recombinant human AKR7A3 and AFB1 dihydrodiol at pH 7.4, the catalytic efficiency of this reaction (k2/K, per M/s) equals or exceeds those reported for other enzymes, for example cytochrome P450s and glutathione S-transferases, known to metabolize AFB1 in vivo. These findings indicate that, depending on the extent of AFB1 dihydrodiol formation, AKR7A may contribute to the protection against AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity.
hairy and enhancer of split homolog	HES-1	Expression pattern of notch1, 2 and 3 and Jagged1 and 2 in lymphoid and stromal thymus components: distinct ligand-receptor interactions in intrathymic T cell development. The suggested role of Notch1 or its mutants in thymocyte differentiation and T cell tumorigenesis raises the question of how the different members of the Notch family influence distinct steps in T cell development and the role played by Notch ligands in the thymus. We report here that different Notch receptor-ligand partnerships may occur inside the thymus, as we observed differential expression of Notch1, 2 and 3 receptors, their ligands Jagged1 and 2, and downstream intracellular effectors hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 1 (HES-1) and hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 5 (HES-5), depending on ontogenetic stage and thymic cell populations. Indeed, while Jagged2 is expressed in both stromal cells and thymocytes, Jagged1 expression is restricted to stromal cells. Moreover, a differential distribution of Notch3, with respect to Notch1, was observed in distinct age-related thymocyte subsets. Finally, Notch3 was preferentially up-regulated in thymocytes, following the induction of their differentiation by interaction with thymic epithelial cells expressing the cognate Jagged1 and 2 ligands, suggesting that, besides Notch1, Notch3 may also be involved in distinct steps of thymocyte development. Our results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway is involved in a complex interplay of T cell developmental stages, as a consequence of the heterogeneity and specific expression of members of the Notch receptor family and their cognate ligands, in distinct thymic cell compartments.

bm - 40 / secreted protein , acidic and rich in cystein	SPARC	Molecular cloning of testican-2: defining a novel calcium-binding proteoglycan family expressed in brain. We have screened a human cDNA library using an expressed sequence tag related to the BM-40/secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)/osteonectin family of proteins and isolated a novel cDNA. It encodes a protein precursor of 424 amino acids that consists of a signal peptide, a follistatin-like domain, a Ca2+-binding domain, a thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with two putative glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The protein is homologous to testican-1 and was termed testican-2. Testican-1 is a proteoglycan originally isolated from human seminal plasma that is also expressed in brain. Northern blot hybridization of testican-2 showed a 6.1-kb mRNA expressed mainly in CNS but also found in lung and testis. A widespread expression in multiple neuronal cell types in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and medulla was detected by in situ hybridization. A recombinant fragment consisting of the Ca2+-binding EF-hand domain and the thyroglobulin-like domain of testican-2 showed a reversible Ca2+-dependent conformational change in circular dichroism studies. Testican-1 and -2 form a novel Ca2+-binding proteoglycan family built of modular domains with the potential to participate in diverse steps of neurogenesis.
paracellin -	PCLN-1	Paracellin-1, a renal tight junction protein required for paracellular Mg2+ resorption. Epithelia permit selective and regulated flux from apical to basolateral surfaces by transcellular passage through cells or paracellular flux between cells. Tight junctions constitute the barrier to paracellular conductance; however, little is known about the specific molecules that mediate paracellular permeabilities. Renal magnesium ion (Mg2+) resorption occurs predominantly through a paracellular conductance in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL). Here, positional cloning has identified a human gene, paracellin-1 (PCLN-1), mutations in which cause renal Mg2+ wasting. PCLN-1 is located in tight junctions of the TAL and is related to the claudin family of tight junction proteins. These findings provide insight into Mg2+ homeostasis, demonstrate the role of a tight junction protein in human disease, and identify an essential component of a selective paracellular conductance.
n - methyl - d - aspar	NMDA	Regulation of NMDA receptors by an associated phosphatase-kinase signaling complex. Regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity by kinases and phosphatases contributes to the modulation of synaptic transmission. Targeting of these enzymes near the substrate is proposed to enhance phosphorylation-dependent modulation. Yotiao, an NMDA receptor-associated protein, bound the type I protein phosphatase (PP1) and the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme. Anchored PP1 was active, limiting channel activity, whereas PKA activation overcame constitutive PP1 activity and conferred rapid enhancement of NMDA receptor currents. Hence, yotiao is a scaffold protein that physically attaches PP1 and PKA to NMDA receptors to regulate channel activity.

autosomal dominant retinitis pigment	RP	Mutations in a gene encoding a new oxygen-regulated photoreceptor protein cause dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP) locus, designated RP1, has been mapped through linkage studies to a 4-cM interval at 8q11-13. Here we describe a new photoreceptor-specific gene that maps in this interval and whose expression is modulated by retinal oxygen levels in vivo. This gene consists of at least 4 exons that encode a predicted protein of 2,156 amino acids. A nonsense mutation at codon 677 of this gene is present in approximately 3% of cases of dominant RP in North America. We also detected two deletion mutations that cause frameshifts and introduce premature termination codons in three other families with dominant RP. Our data suggest that mutations in this gene cause dominant RP, and that the encoded protein has an important but unknown role in photoreceptor biology.
chondrodysplasia puncta	CDP	Mutations in the gene encoding 3 beta-hydroxysteroid-delta 8, delta 7-isomerase cause X-linked dominant Conradi-Hünermann syndrome. X-linked dominant Conradi-Hünermann syndrome (CDPX2; MIM 302960) is one of a group of disorders with aberrant punctate calcification in cartilage, or chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP). This is most prominent around the vertebral column, pelvis and long bones in CPDX2. Additionally, CDPX2 patients may have asymmetric rhizomesomelia, sectorial cataracts, patchy alopecia, ichthyosis and atrophoderma. The phenotype in CDPX2 females ranges from stillborn to mildly affected individuals identified in adulthood. CDPX2 is presumed lethal in males, although a few affected males have been reported. We found increased 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol in tissue samples from seven female probands with CDPX2 (ref. 4). This pattern of accumulated cholesterol intermediates suggested a deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase (sterol-delta8-isomerase), which catalyses an intermediate step in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. A candidate gene encoding a sterol-delta8-isomerase (EBP) has been identified and mapped to Xp11.22-p11.23 (refs 5,6). Using SSCP analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA, we found EBP mutations in all probands. We confirmed the functional significance of two missense alleles by expressing them in a sterol-delta8-isomerase-deficient yeast strain. Our results indicate that defects in sterol-delta8-isomerase cause CDPX2 and suggest a role for sterols in bone development.
familial british	FBD	A stop-codon mutation in the BRI gene associated with familial British dementia. Familial British dementia (FBD), previously designated familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy-British type, is an autosomal dominant disorder of undetermined origin characterized by progressive dementia, spasticity, and cerebellar ataxia, with onset at around the fifth decade of life. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, non-neuritic and perivascular plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the predominant pathological lesions. Here we report the identification of a unique 4K protein subunit named ABri from isolated amyloid fibrils. This highly insoluble peptide is a fragment of a putative type-II single-spanning transmembrane precursor that is encoded by a novel gene, BRI, located on chromosome 13. A single base substitution at the stop codon of this gene generates a longer open reading frame, resulting in a larger, 277-residue precursor. Release of the 34 carboxy-terminal amino acids from the mutated precursor generates the ABri amyloid subunit. The mutation creates a cutting site for the restriction enzyme XbaI, which is useful for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Antibodies against the amyloid or homologous synthetic peptides recognize both parenchymal and vascular lesions in FBD patients. A point mutation at the stop codon of BRI therefore results in the generation of the ABri peptide, which is deposited as amyloid fibrils causing neuronal disfunction and dementia.
paired helical filam	PHFs	The prolyl isomerase Pin1 restores the function of Alzheimer-associated phosphorylated tau protein. One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the neurofibrillary tangle, which contains paired helical filaments (PHFs) composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in PHFs, and phosphorylation of tau abolishes its ability to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly. Restoring the function of phosphorylated tau might prevent or reverse PHF formation in Alzheimer's disease. Phosphorylation on a serine or threonine that precedes proline (pS/T-P) alters the rate of prolyl isomerization and creates a binding site for the WW domain of the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 specifically isomerizes pS/T-P bonds and regulates the function of mitotic phosphoproteins. Here we show that Pin1 binds to only one pT-P motif in tau and copurifies with PHFs, resulting in depletion of soluble Pin1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Pin1 can restore the ability of phosphorylated tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly in vitro. As depletion of Pin1 induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death, sequestration of Pin1 into PHFs may contribute to neuronal death. These findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
quinone oxidoreductase	NQO1	A potential mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of individuals with a polymorphism in NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) to benzene toxicity. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a two-electron reductase that detoxifies quinones derived from the oxidation of phenolic metabolites of benzene. A polymorphism in NQO1, a C609T substitution, has been identified, and individuals homozygous for this change (T/T) have no detectable NQO1. Exposed workers with a T/T genotype have an increased risk of benzene hematotoxicity. This finding suggests NQO1 is protective against benzene toxicity, which is difficult to reconcile with the lack of detectable NQO1 in human bone marrow. The human promyeloblastic cell line, KG-1a, was used to investigate the ability of the benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) to induce NQO1. A concentration-dependent induction of NQO1 protein and activity was observed in KG-1a cells cultured with HQ. Multiple detoxification systems, including NQO1 and glutathione protect against benzene metabolite-induced toxicity. Indeed, exposure to a noncytotoxic concentration of HQ induced both NQO1 and soluble thiols and protected against HQ-induced apoptosis. NQO1 protein and activity increased in wild-type human bone marrow cells (C/C) exposed to HQ, whereas no NQO1 was induced by HQ in bone marrow cells with the T/T genotype. Intermediate induction of NQO1 by HQ was observed in heterozygous bone marrow cells (C/T). NQO1 also was induced by HQ in wild-type (C/C) human bone marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells. Our data suggest that failure to induce functional NQO1 may contribute to the increased risk of benzene poisoning in individuals homozygous for the NQO1 C609T substitution (T/T).

A polymorphism in NQO1, a C609T substitution, has been identified, and individuals homozygous for this change (T/T) have no detectable NQO1. Exposed workers with a T/T genotype have an increased risk of benzene hematotoxicity. This finding suggests NQO1 is protective against benzene toxicity, which is difficult to reconcile with the lack of detectable NQO1 in human bone marrow. The human promyeloblastic cell line, KG-1a, was used to investigate the ability of the benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) to induce NQO1. A concentration-dependent induction of NQO1 protein and activity was observed in KG-1a cells cultured with HQ. Multiple detoxification systems, including NQO1 and glutathione protect against benzene metabolite-induced toxicity. Indeed, exposure to a noncytotoxic concentration of HQ induced both NQO1 and soluble thiols and protected against HQ-induced apoptosis. NQO1 protein and activity increased in wild-type human bone marrow cells (C/C) exposed to HQ, whereas no NQO1 was induced by HQ in bone marrow cells with the T/T genotype. Intermediate induction of NQO1 by HQ was observed in heterozygous bone marrow cells (C/T). NQO1 also was induced by HQ in wild-type (C/C) human bone marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells. Our data suggest that failure to induce functional NQO1 may contribute to the increased risk of benzene poisoning in individuals homozygous for the NQO1 C609T substitution (T/T).
junctional adhesion	JAM	Cutting edge: combined treatment of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma causes redistribution of junctional adhesion molecule in human endothelial cells. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induce cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and promote transmigration of leukocytes across endothelial cells. However, when those two were administered together, leukocyte transmigration paradoxically decreased. We cloned a human and bovine homologue of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), a novel molecule at the tight junction, and examined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on JAM in HUVECs. The combined treatment of TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma caused a disappearance of JAM from intercellular junctions. However, flow cytometry, cell ELISA, and subcellular fractionation analysis demonstrated that the amount of JAM was not reduced. This suggested that JAM changed its distribution in response to proinflammatory cytokines. This redistribution of JAM might be involved in a decrease in transendothelial migration of leukocytes at inflammatory sites.
aryl hydrocarbon	AhR	Interactions of nuclear receptor coactivator/corepressor proteins with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells express the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and treatment with AhR agonists such as 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) inhibits estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated responses. This study investigates physical and functional interactions of the AhR complex with a prototypical coactivator (estrogen receptor associating protein 140, ERAP 140) and corepressor (silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor, SMRT) for ER and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The AhR, AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), and AhR/Arnt proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with 35S-ERAP 140 and 35S-SMRT and, in gel mobility shift assays, AhR/Arnt binding to 32P-dioxin response element (DRE) was enhanced by ERAP-140 and inhibited by SMRT; supershifted bands were not observed. In transactivation assays, coactivator and corepressor proteins enhanced or inhibited AhR-mediated gene expression; however, these responses varied with the amount of coactivator/corepressor expression. These results confirmed functional and physical interactions of AhR/Arnt with ERAP 140 and SMRT in breast cancer cells.

dopamine beta - hydroxy	DBH	Genomic structure and functional characterization of NBPhox (PMX2B), a homeodomain protein specific to catecholaminergic cells that is involved in second messenger-mediated transcriptional activation. Homeodomain proteins play essential roles in basic processes during embryogenesis and development. NBPhox, a vertebrate paired-like homeodomain protein specific to catecholaminergic cells, may have a fundamental role in determining and maintaining the catecholaminergic phenotype. Here we describe the human and mouse genomic structures and the functional characterization of NBPhox. The genomic structure of NBPhox is highly conserved at the nucleotide level between human and mouse and is also quite similar to that of other paired-like homeodomain proteins, Arix/Phox2a, CRX, OTX1, and OTX2. The human NBPhox gene (HGMW-approved symbol PMX2B) maps to chromosomal region 5p12-p13. When the NBPhox expression plasmid was introduced into PC12h cells, the transcription from the promoter of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) gene was slightly stimulated. However, NBPhox substantially enhances second messenger-mediated activation of the DBH promoter by forskolin and/or phorbol ester. Furthermore, we found that NBPhox can also enhance second messenger-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter and several enhancers, including cyclic AMP-response element, the binding site for activator protein 1, and serum-response element. Our findings provide strong evidence that a homeodomain protein is involved in the activation of several genetic regulatory elements responsive to second messenger-mediated signals. These data suggest that this family of proteins may be involved in determining and maintaining a cell-specific phenotype through regulation of certain genes responsive to second messenger-mediated signals.
hereditary spastic paraple	HSP	Identification and characterization of AFG3L2, a novel paraplegin-related gene. We recently identified a gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This gene encodes paraplegin, a mitochondrial protein highly homologous to the yeast mitochondrial ATPases Afg3p and Rcalp, which have both proteolytic and chaperone-like activities at the inner mitochondrial membrane. By screening the Expressed Sequence Tag database, we identified and characterized a novel human cDNA, ATPase family gene 3-like 2 (AFG3L2, Human Gene Nomenclature Committee-approved symbol), which is closely related to paraplegin. This cDNA encodes a 797-amino-acid predicted protein highly similar to paraplegin as well as to yeast Afg3p and Rca1p. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that AFG3L2 and paraplegin share a similar expression pattern and the same subcellular localization, the mitochondrial compartment. We subsequently mapped AFG3L2 to chromosome 18p11 by radiation hybrid analysis. AFG3L2 may represent a candidate gene for other forms of HSPs and possibly for other neurodegenerative disorders.

male - specific	MSL	Characterization of a novel chromo domain gene in xp22.3 with homology to Drosophila msl-3. The Drosophila male-specific lethal (MSL) genes regulate transcription from the male X chromosome in a dosage compensation pathway that equalizes X-linked gene expression in males and females. The members of this gene family, including msl-1, msl-2, msl-3, mle, and mof, encode proteins with no sequence homology. However, mutations in each of these genes produce a similar phenotype: sex-specific lethality of male embryos caused by the failure of mutants to increase transcription from the single male X chromosome. The MSL gene products assemble into a multiprotein transcriptional activation complex at hundreds of sites along the chromatin of the X chromosome. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a human gene, named MSL3L1, that encodes a protein with significant homology to Drosophila MSL-3 in three distinct regions, including two putative chromo domains. MSL3L1 was identified by database queries with genomic sequence from BAC GS-590J6 (GenBank AC0004554) in Xp22.3 and was evaluated as a candidate gene for several developmental disorders mapping to this region, including OFD1 and SED tarda, as well as Aicardi syndrome and Goltz syndrome.
a disintegrin and metalloprotea	ADAM	Identification of four novel ADAMs with potential roles in spermatogenesis and fertilization. The ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family is known to have important roles in various developmental systems, e.g., myogenesis and neurogenesis. In this study, we searched for ADAMs that may function in spermatogenesis or fertilization, and have cloned and sequenced four new mouse ADAM cDNAs: ADAM 24, ADAM 25, ADAM 26 and ADAM 27. The deduced amino acid sequences show that all four contain the complete domain organization common to ADAM family members. Messenger RNA for each of the four ADAMs was found only in the testis. The conserved zinc-dependent metalloprotease active site HEXGHXXGXXHD was found in the metalloprotease domain of three of the novel ADAMs, suggesting that they are testis-specific proteases, to which we give the alternative names: testase 1, ADAM 24; testase 2, ADAM 25; and testase 3, ADAM 26. Using RNA extracted from testes of pre-pubertal males of increasing age (8-40days), we found that adult levels of transcription, assessed in Northern blots, are reached by day 20 (ADAM 27), day 25 (ADAMs 24 and 25) and in the range day 25-50 (ADAM 26). These results suggest that each ADAM is transcribed in spermatogenic cells in a regulated pattern at a specific developmental stage.
receptor for	RAGE	RAGE mediates a novel proinflammatory axis: a central cell surface receptor for S100/calgranulin polypeptides. S100/calgranulin polypeptides are present at sites of inflammation, likely released by inflammatory cells targeted to such loci by a range of environmental cues. We report here that receptor for AGE (RAGE) is a central cell surface receptor for EN-RAGE (extracellular newly identified RAGE-binding protein) and related members of the S100/calgranulin superfamily. Interaction of EN-RAGEs with cellular RAGE on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key proinflammatory mediators. Blockade of EN-RAGE/RAGE quenches delayed-type hypersensitivity and inflammatory colitis in murine models by arresting activation of central signaling pathways and expression of inflammatory gene mediators. These data highlight a novel paradigm in inflammation and identify roles for EN-RAGEs and RAGE in chronic cellular activation and tissue injury.

androgen	AR	The linkage of Kennedy's neuron disease to ARA24, the first identified androgen receptor polyglutamine region-associated coactivator. Although the linkage of polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) to Kennedy's disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy) was a major step forward, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the change in poly-Q length contributes to the disease remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a nuclear G-protein, Ras-related nuclear protein/ARA24, as the first AR coactivator that can bind differentially with different lengths of poly-Q within AR. In the yeast and mammalian reciprocal interacting assays, our data suggested the interaction of AR N-terminal domain with ARA24 diminishes as the poly-Q length increases. The coactivation of ARA24 also diminishes with the poly-Q expansion within AR. Deletion of the acidic hexapeptide (DEDDDL) at the C terminus of ARA24 further enhances its AR coactivation. Together, our data suggest that poor interaction and weaker coactivation of ARA24 to the longer poly-Q AR in the X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophied AR could contribute to the weaker transactivation of AR. The consequence of poor interaction and weak coactivation may eventually lead to the partial androgen insensitivity during the development of Kennedy's disease.
extracellular - regulated kinase	ERKs	Src-family tyrosine kinases in activation of ERK-1 and p85/p110-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by G/CCKB receptors. We have analyzed in Chinese hamster ovary cells the upstream mediators by which the G protein-coupled receptor, gastrin/CCKB, activates the extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p85/p110-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways. Overexpression of an inhibitory mutant of Shc completely blocked gastrin-stimulated Shc.Grb2 complex formation but partially inhibited ERK-1 activation by this peptide. Expression of Csk, which inactivates Src-family kinases, totally inhibited gastrin-induced Src-like activity detected in anti-Src and anti-Shc precipitates but diminished by 50% Shc phosphorylation and ERK-1 activation. We observed a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and an increase in Src-like kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-stimulated cells, suggesting that IRS-1 may be a direct substrate of Src. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of gastrin-induced Src. IRS-1 complex formation and IRS-1 phosphorylation in Csk-transfected cells. In addition, the increase in PI 3-kinase activity measured in anti-p85 or anti-IRS-1 precipitates following gastrin stimulation was abolished by Csk. Our results demonstrate the existence of two mechanisms in gastrin-mediated ERKs activation. One requires Shc phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, and the other one is independent of these two proteins. They also indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by Src-family kinases could lead to the recruitment and the activation of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase in response to gastrin.

neurofibromatosis	NF2	Novel alternatively spliced isoforms of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor are targeted to the nucleus and cytoplasmic granules. We cloned novel splice variants Mer150, Mer151 and Mer162 of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor, which demonstrate a tissue-specific and development-specific expression pattern. Isoform Mer150 is created by cryptic splicing from exon 8 to 14 and represents an N-terminal truncation of 259 residues. Mer151 is characterized by in-frame splicing out of several exons and a modified C-terminus due to a frameshift in exons 13+14 and premature termination. Mer162 represents a head-to-tail isoform resulting from in-frame skipping of exons 5-16. As a common feature, the alpha-helical domain and a variable proportion of the ERM homology domain are spliced out in these isoforms. To investigate differences in subcellular localization, we expressed epitope-tagged cDNA constructs of the wild-type NF2 as well as of the three alternatively spliced transcripts in NIH 3T3 cells by nuclear microinjection or lipid-mediated transfection. Subcellular localization of Mer151 in filopodia and ruffling membranes was similar to the wild-type NF2. Mer151, however, was targeted to the nucleus, which was not observed for wild-type NF2, Mer150 or Mer162. A putative nuclear localization signal created by alternative splicing was identified in Mer151. In contrast to Mer151, Mer150 and Mer162 were not found in regions of the plasma membrane, but localized to a granular intracellular compartment. The results suggest that the recently described actin-binding domain in exon 10, but not the presence or absence of exons 2+3, is relevant for subcellular targeting. Although the NF2 protein is known as a cytoskeletal linker, additional functions in a cytoplasmic compartment and in the nucleus may exist.
drosophila lathe	lat	latheo encodes a subunit of the origin recognition complex and disrupts neuronal proliferation and adult olfactory memory when mutant. The Drosophila latheo (lat) gene was identified in a behavioral screen for olfactory memory mutants. The original hypomorphic latP1 mutant (Boynton and Tully, 1992) shows a structural defect in adult brain. Homozygous lethal lat mutants lack imaginal discs, show little cell proliferation in the CNS of third instar larvae, and die as early pupae. latP1 was cloned, and all of the above mentioned defects of hypomorphic or homozygous lethal lat mutants were rescued with a lat+ transgene. lat encodes a novel protein with homology to a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC). Human and Drosophila LAT both associate with ORC2 and are related to yeast ORC3, suggesting that LAT functions in DNA replication during cell proliferation.

nuclear	NE	A visual screen of a GFP-fusion library identifies a new type of nuclear envelope membrane protein. The nuclear envelope (NE) is a distinct subdomain of the ER, but few membrane components have been described that are specific to it. We performed a visual screen in tissue culture cells to identify proteins targeted to the NE. This approach does not require assumptions about the nature of the association with the NE or the physical separation of NE and ER. We confirmed that screening a library of fusions to the green fluorescent protein can be used to identify proteins targeted to various subcompartments of mammalian cells, including the NE. With this approach, we identified a new NE membrane protein, named nurim. Nurim is a multispanning membrane protein without large hydrophilic domains that is very tightly associated with the nucleus. Unlike the known NE membrane proteins, it is neither associated with nuclear pores, nor targeted like lamin-associated membrane proteins. Thus, nurim is a new type of NE membrane protein that is localized to the NE by a distinct mechanism.
brefeldin	BFA	GBF1: A novel Golgi-associated BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor that displays specificity for ADP-ribosylation factor 5. Expression cloning from a cDNA library prepared from a mutant CHO cell line with Golgi-specific resistance to Brefeldin A (BFA) identified a novel 206-kD protein with a Sec7 domain termed GBF1 for Golgi BFA resistance factor 1. Overexpression of GBF1 allowed transfected cells to maintain normal Golgi morphology and grow in the presence of BFA. Golgi- enriched membrane fractions from such transfected cells displayed normal levels of ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) activation and coat protein recruitment that were, however, BFA resistant. Hexahistidine-tagged-GBF1 exhibited BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange activity that appears specific towards ARF5 at physiological Mg2+concentration. Characterization of cDNAs recovered from the mutant and wild-type parental lines established that transcripts in these cells had identical sequence and, therefore, that GBF1 was naturally BFA resistant. GBF1 was primarily cytosolic but a significant pool colocalized to a perinuclear structure with the beta-subunit of COPI. Immunogold labeling showed highest density of GBF1 over Golgi cisternae and significant labeling over pleiomorphic smooth vesiculotubular structures. The BFA-resistant nature of GBF1 suggests involvement in retrograde traffic.

amino	AA	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding the human leucocyte vacuolar protein sorting (h1Vps45). We have isolated a novel cDNA clone from human leucocyte cDNA library, encoding a Sec1p-like vacuolar protein sorting (h1Vps45) which is believed to be implicated in vesicular transportation. Although the deduced amino acid (AA) sequence of this cDNA has revealed 97% identity to other known mammalian vacuolar protein sorting, there is an extensive variation in nucleotide sequence in comparison to that of three previously reported human (hVps45), rat (rVps45) and mouse (mVps45) vacuolar protein sorting (Vps45) cDNAs [1-3]. At the nucleotide sequence level h1Vps45 demonstrated 90% homology to the hVps45 and rVps45 and 89% identity to mVps45 with no significant homology in their noncoding regions. The 2.4 Kb mRNA corresponding to the h1Vps45 clone is widely distributed in a variety of human tissues expressing highest levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), neutrophils, heart, spleen, and testis. The chromosomal mapping studies have demonstrated that the h1Vps45 is localized to long arm of human chromosome 1 at q21-q22. Our data indicates that we have isolated, characterized and mapped a novel cDNA encoding h1Vps45, which may play an important role in protein trafficking as well as have clinical significance in the release of inflammatory mediators e.g. histamine, bradykinin and cytokine release.

At the nucleotide sequence level h1Vps45 demonstrated 90% homology to the hVps45 and rVps45 and 89% identity to mVps45 with no significant homology in their noncoding regions. The 2.4 Kb mRNA corresponding to the h1Vps45 clone is widely distributed in a variety of human tissues expressing highest levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), neutrophils, heart, spleen, and testis. The chromosomal mapping studies have demonstrated that the h1Vps45 is localized to long arm of human chromosome 1 at q21-q22. Our data indicates that we have isolated, characterized and mapped a novel cDNA encoding h1Vps45, which may play an important role in protein trafficking as well as have clinical significance in the release of inflammatory mediators e.g. histamine, bradykinin and cytokine release.
angiotensin ii type 2	AT2	Analysis of functional domains of angiotensin II type 2 receptor involved in apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that the intracellular third loop (i3 loop) of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) plays a key role in mediating the biological functions of this receptor. To determine which residues are important for AT2 signaling, mutated receptors with serial deletions within the i3 loop were stably expressed in PC12 cells. Deletion of residues 240-244 within the intermediate portion of the i3 loop resulted in a complete loss of AT2-mediated apoptosis, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and SHP-1 activation. In contrast to well characterized heptahelical receptors, the AT2 functions were not affected by deletions of the amino- or carboxyl-terminal portions of the i3 loop. Alanine substitutions further demonstrated that lysine 240, asparagine 242, and serine 243 are key residues for AT2-induced apoptosis, ERK inhibition, and SHP-1 activation. To examine whether a functional link exists between activation of SHP-1 and apoptosis, we used a catalytically inactive SHP-1 mutant and demonstrated that preventing SHP-1 activation strongly attenuates AT2-induced ERK inhibition and apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that the intermediate portion of the i3 loop is important for AT2 function and that SHP-1 is a proximal effector of the AT2 receptor that is implicated in the inhibition of ERKs and in the apoptotic effect of this receptor.

protein kinase cze	PKCzeta	Cloning, expression and characterization of an A6-related protein. By interaction cloning (yeast two-hybrid system) using the catalytic domain of protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta) as bait, we cloned a human full-length cDNA with 62% nucleotide homology to the A6 protein recently cloned and characterized by Beeler et al. [Beeler, J.F., LaRochelle, W.J., Chedid, M., Tronick, S.R. & Aaronson, S. A. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 982-988]. The deduced amino acid sequence (349 amino acids) of the A6-related protein (A6rp) contained potential actin-binding sites and ATP-binding sites. We also cloned the murine homolog of A6rp. Human A6rp was expressed in an in-vitro transcriptional/translational system with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa and as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in bacteria. A polyclonal anti-(A6rp) was raised in rabbits and used for the identification of A6rp by immunoblotting. A6rp was found to be expressed at the mRNA and the protein levels in all cells and tissues investigated. GST-A6rp was phosphorylated by PKCzeta but not significantly by other PKC isoenzymes. Moreover, it was phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 and most effectively by the tyrosine kinase Src. In contrast to GST-A6rp, GST-A6 was also phosphorylated by PKC isoforms other than PKCzeta and strongly by CK2, but just weakly by Src. In contrast to the results of Beeler et al. on beta-galactosidase-A6, we were unable to demonstrate autokinase activity or tyrosine phosphorylation of either GST-A6 or GST-A6rp. In accordance with the potential ATP-binding sites, both proteins were able to bind ATP.

autoimmune lymphoproliferative	ALPS	Inherited human Caspase 10 mutations underlie defective lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome type II. Caspases are cysteine proteases that mediate programmed cell death in phylogenetically diverse multicellular organisms. We report here two kindreds with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) type II, characterized by abnormal lymphocyte and dendritic cell homeostasis and immune regulatory defects, that harbor independent missense mutations in Caspase 10. These encode amino acid substitutions that decrease caspase activity and interfere with death receptor-induced apoptosis, particularly that stimulated by Fas ligand and TRAIL. These results provide evidence that inherited nonlethal caspase abnormalities cause pleiotropic apoptosis defects underlying autoimmunity in ALPS type II.
a - kinase anchoring	AKAPs	mAKAP: an A-kinase anchoring protein targeted to the nuclear membrane of differentiated myocytes. The compartmentalization of second messenger-activated protein kinases contributes to the fidelity of hormone-mediated signal transduction events. For example, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is tethered at specific intracellular locations through association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). We now report the cloning of mAKAP, an anchoring protein found predominantly in heart, skeletal muscle and brain, and whose expression is induced in neonatal ventriculocytes by treatment with hypertrophic stimuli. mAKAP is targeted to the nuclear membrane of differentiated myocytes. Analysis of mAKAP-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs revealed that nuclear membrane targeting is conferred by two regions of the protein, between residues 772-915 and 915-1065, which contain spectrin-like repeat sequences. Heterologous expression of the mAKAP targeting sequences displaced the endogenous anchoring protein from the nuclear membrane, demonstrating that mAKAP targeting is saturable. Collectively, these data suggest that a domain containing spectrin-like repeats mediates targeting of the anchoring protein mAKAP and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme to the nuclear membrane in response to differentiation signals.

pleckstrin homo	PH	Pleckstrin 2, a widely expressed paralog of pleckstrin involved in actin rearrangement. We have identified a cDNA for pleckstrin 2 that is 39% identical and 65% homologous to the original pleckstrin. Like the original pleckstrin 1, this protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at each end of the molecule as well as a DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin) domain in the intervening sequence. A Northern blot probed with the full-length cDNA reveals that this homolog is ubiquitously expressed and is most abundant in the thymus, large bowel, small bowel, stomach, and prostate. Unlike pleckstrin 1, this newly discovered protein does not contain obvious sites of PKC phosphorylation, and in transfected Cos-7 cells, it is a poor substrate for phosphorylation, even after PMA stimulation. Cells expressing pleckstrin 2 undergo a dramatic shape change associated with actin rearrangement, including a loss of central F-actin and a redistribution of actin toward the cell cortex. Overexpression of pleckstrin 2 causes large lamellipodia and peripheral ruffle formation. A variant of pleckstrin 2 lacking both PH domains still had some membrane binding but did not efficiently induce lamellipodia, suggesting that the PH domains of pleckstrin 2 contribute to lamellipodia formation. This work describes a novel, widely expressed, membrane-associating protein and suggests that pleckstrin 2 may help orchestrate cytoskeletal arrangement.
spermidine / spermine n ( 1 ) - acetyltransferas	SSAT	Cloning and characterization of human polyamine-modulated factor-1, a transcriptional cofactor that regulates the transcription of the spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase gene. The increased transcription and ultimate superinduction of the spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) gene has been associated with the antineoplastic activity of several new antitumor polyamine analogues. In sensitive tumor cell types, the transcriptional induction appears to be regulated by the constitutive association of the transcription factor Nrf-2 with the recently discovered polyamine-responsive element. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a new transcriptional cofactor, polyamine-modulated factor-1 (PMF-1), has been identified as a partner protein of Nrf-2 that, in combination with Nrf-2, regulates the polyamine analogue-induced transcription of SSAT. The human PMF-1 gene, located on chromosome 1 near the 1q12/1q21 border, yields an mRNA transcript of approximately 1.2 kilobases that codes for a 165-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa. The PMF-1 mRNA appears to increase in response to analogue exposure only in analogue-responsive cells. In addition to the transcriptional regulation of SSAT, PMF-1 or similar factors should be considered in the regulation of other polyamine-dependent genes.

nociceptin / orphanin f	N/OFQ	Agonistic effect of buprenorphine in a nociceptin/OFQ receptor-triggered reporter gene assay. The role of the opioid-like receptor 1 (ORL1) and its endogenous ligand, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), in nociception, anxiety, and learning remains to be defined. To allow the rapid identification of agonists and antagonists, a reporter gene assay has been established in which the ORL1 receptor is functionally linked to the cyclic AMP-dependent expression of luciferase. N/OFQ and N/OFQ(1-13)NH(2) inhibited the forskolin-induced luciferase gene expression with IC(50) values of 0.81 +/- 0.5 and 0.87 +/- 0.16 nM, respectively. Buprenorphine was identified as a full agonist at the ORL1 receptor with an IC(50) value of 8.4 +/- 2.8 nM. Fentanyl and 7-benzylidenenaltrexone displayed a weak agonistic activity. The ORL1 antagonist [Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)]N/OFQ((1-13))NH(2) clearly behaved as an agonist in this assay with an IC(50) value of 85 +/- 47 nM. Thus, there is still a need for antagonistic tool compounds that might help to elucidate the neurophysiological role of N/OFQ.
melanin - concentrating	MCH	Melanin-concentrating hormone is the cognate ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1. The underlying causes of obesity are poorly understood but probably involve complex interactions between many neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. We also show that SLC-1 messenger RNA and protein is expressed in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, consistent with a role for SLC-1 in mediating the effects of MCH on feeding.
facilitates chromatin	FACT	The chromatin-specific transcription elongation factor FACT comprises human SPT16 and SSRP1 proteins. The regulation of gene expression depends critically upon chromatin structure. Transcription of protein-coding genes can be reconstituted on naked DNA with only the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. This minimal system cannot transcribe DNA packaged into chromatin, indicating that accessory factors may facilitate access to DNA. Two classes of accessory factor, ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzymes and histone acetyltransferases, facilitate transcription initiation from chromatin templates. FACT (for facilitates chromatin transcription) is a chromatin-specific elongation factor required for transcription of chromatin templates in vitro. Here we show that FACT comprises a new human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt16/Cdc68 protein and the high-mobility group-1-like protein structure-specific recognition protein-1. Yeast SPT16/CDC68 is an essential gene that has been implicated in transcription and cell-cycle regulation. Consistent with our biochemical analysis of FACT, we provide evidence that Spt16/Cdc68 is involved in transcript elongation in vivo. Moreover, FACT specifically interacts with nucleosomes and histone H2A/H2B dimers, indicating that it may work by promoting nucleosome disassembly upon transcription. In support of this model, we show that FACT activity is abrogated by covalently crosslinking nucleosomal histones.
lipopolysaccha	LPS	IKK-i, a novel lipopolysaccharide-inducible kinase that is related to IkappaB kinases. Using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique, we isolated a novel kinase, IKK-i, whose message is drastically induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264. 7. The predicted protein contains the kinase domain in its N-terminus, which shares 30% identity to that of IKK-alpha or IKK-beta. The C-terminal portion contains a leucine zipper and a potential helix-loop-helix domain, as in the case of IKK-alpha and IKK-beta. IKK-i is expressed mainly in immune cells, and is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6, in addition to LPS. Overexpression of wild-type IKK-i phosphorylated serine residues Ser32 and Ser36 of IkappaB-alpha (preferentially Ser36), and significantly stimulated NF-kappaB activation. These results suggest that IKK-i is an inducible IkappaB kinase which may play a special role in the immune response.
mak - related	MRK	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel member of the MAP kinase superfamily. BACKGROUND: Members of the MAP kinase superfamily play important roles in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways, and several members have been identified. However, the diversity and complexity of cellular responses in mammalian systems may imply existence of hitherto unidentified members of the MAP kinase superfamily. RESULTS: We report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel member of the MAP kinase superfamily. We isolated full-length mouse and human cDNAs that encode complete open reading frames of a novel protein kinase, termed MOK. MOK consists of 419 (human) and 420 (mouse) amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 48kDa. MOK contains all of the protein serine/threonine kinase consensus motifs and shows a modest similarity to members of the MAP kinase superfamily and MAK and MAK-related kinase (MRK). In addition, MOK possesses a Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) motif in the activation loop domain, as do classical MAP kinases. MOK is widely expressed in normal tissues and organs and localizes to the cytoplasm. MOK is able to phosphorylate several known MAP kinase substrates and to undergo autophosphorylation. A mutation in the TEY motif to AEF abolished the kinase activity of MOK, and the treatment of cells with a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, enhanced the kinase activity of MOK, suggesting the existence of an upstream kinase. Phorbol ester TPA was found to stimulate the kinase activity of MOK, whereas serum stimulation, osmotic shock, or anisomycin treatment did not significantly activate MOK. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MOK is distantly related to members of known subfamilies of the MAP kinase superfamily and can therefore be classified as a novel member.
nonfamilial idiopathic cardiomyo	IDC	Polymorphisms in the SOD2 and HLA-DRB1 genes are associated with nonfamilial idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in Japanese. To reveal genetic risk factors of nonfamilial idiopathic cardiomyopathy (IDC) in Japanese, polymorphisms in the SOD2 and HLA-DRB1 genes were investigated in 86 patients and 380 healthy controls. There was a significant excess of homozygotes for the V allele [Val versus Ala (A allele), a polymorphism in the leader peptide of manganese superoxide dismutase at position 16] of the SOD2 gene in the patients compared with the controls (87.2% versus 74.7%, odds ratio = 2.30, p = 0.013, pc < 0.03), and a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-DRB1*1401 in the patients was confirmed (14.0% vs 4.5%, odds ratio = 3.46, p = 0.001, pc < 0.03). A two-locus analysis suggested that these two genetic markers (SOD2-VV genotype and DRB1*1401) may play a synergistic role in controlling the susceptibility to nonfamilial IDC. In addition, processing efficiency of Val-type SOD2 leader peptide in the presence of mitochondria was siginificantly lower than that of the Ala-type by 11 +/- 4%, suggesting that this lower processing efficiency was in part an underlying mechanism of the association between the SOD2-VV genotype and nonfamilial IDC.
human dbp	hDbp5	Dbp5, a DEAD-box protein required for mRNA export, is recruited to the cytoplasmic fibrils of nuclear pore complex via a conserved interaction with CAN/Nup159p. Dbp5 is a DEAD-box protein essential for mRNA export from the nucleus in yeast. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding human Dbp5 (hDbp5) which is 46% identical to yDbp5p. Like its yeast homologue, hDbp5 is localized within the cytoplasm and at the nuclear rim. By immunoelectron microscopy, the nuclear envelope-bound fraction of Dbp5 has been localized to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Consistent with this localization, we show that both the human and yeast proteins directly interact with an N-terminal region of the nucleoporins CAN/Nup159p. In a conditional yeast strain in which Nup159p is degraded when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, yDbp5p dissociates from the NPC and localizes to the cytoplasm. Thus, Dbp5 is recruited to the NPC via a conserved interaction with CAN/Nup159p. To investigate its function, we generated defective hDbp5 mutants and analysed their effects in RNA export by microinjection in Xenopus oocytes. A mutant protein containing a Glu-->Gln change in the conserved DEAD-box inhibited the nuclear exit of mRNAs. Together, our data indicate that Dbp5 is a conserved RNA-dependent ATPase which is recruited to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC where it participates in the export of mRNAs out of the nucleus.

pleckstrin homo	PH	DAPP1: a dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides. We have identified a novel 280 amino acid protein which contains a putative myristoylation site at its N-terminus followed by an Src homology (SH2) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at its C-terminus. It has been termed dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides (DAPP1). DAPP1 is widely expressed and exhibits high-affinity interactions with PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2), but not with other phospholipids tested. These observations predict that DAPP1 will interact with both tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and 3-phosphoinositides and may therefore play a role in regulating the location and/or activity of such proteins(s) in response to agonists that elevate PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2).
calcium - dependent chloride	CaCC	Identification of three novel members of the calcium-dependent chloride channel (CaCC) family predominantly expressed in the digestive tract and trachea. Three novel human sequences showing striking homology to the recently described bovine Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II-dependent epithelial chloride channel bCaCC have been identified in an expressed sequence tags database. Full-length clones were isolated using a 5' RACE approach. The encoded predicted proteins display 65% overall homology to bCaCC. Tissue expression patterns of the corresponding genes, designated as hCaCC-1, -2 and -3, appear to be highly restricted, with the first two genes primarily expressed in the digestive tract. Another original feature as compared to the CaCC family members is the fact that hCaCC-2 also shows expression in the brain. Taken together these findings demonstrate the existence of several CaCC-like genes in humans, some of which display distinct tissue specificity patterns within the CaCC subfamily of chloride channels.
origin recognition	ORC	Histone acetyltransferase HBO1 interacts with the ORC1 subunit of the human initiator protein. The origin recognition complex (ORC) is an initiator protein for DNA replication, but also effects transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and heterochromatin function in Drosophila. It is not known, however, whether any of these functions of ORC is conserved in mammals. We report the identification of a novel protein, HBO1 (histone acetyltransferase binding to ORC), that interacts with human ORC1 protein, the largest subunit of ORC. HBO1 exists as part of a multisubunit complex that possesses histone H3 and H4 acetyltransferase activities. A fraction of the relatively abundant HBO1 protein associates with ORC1 in human cell extracts. HBO1 is a member of the MYST domain family that includes S. cerevisiae Sas2p, a protein involved in control of transcriptional silencing that also has been genetically linked to ORC function. Thus the interaction between ORC and a MYST domain acetyltransferase is widely conserved. We suggest roles for ORC-mediated acetylation of chromatin in control of both DNA replication and gene expression.
tissue kallikr	KLK	Localization of a new prostate-specific antigen-related serine protease gene, KLK4, is evidence for an expanded human kallikrein gene family cluster on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4. The human tissue kallikrein (KLK) family of serine proteases, which is important in post-translational processing events, currently consists of just three genes-tissue kallikrein (KLK1), KLK2, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (KLK3)-clustered at chromosome 19q13. 3-13.4. We identified an expressed sequence tag from an endometrial carcinoma cDNA library with 50% identity to the three known KLK genes. Primers designed to putative exon 2 and exon 3 regions from this novel kallikrein-related sequence were used to polymerase chain reaction-screen five cosmids spanning 130 kb around the KLK locus on chromosome 19. This new gene, which we have named KLK4, is 25 kb downstream of the KLK2 gene and follows a region that includes two other putative KLK-like gene fragments. KLK4 spans 5.2 kb, has an identical genomic structure-five exons and four introns-to the other KLK genes and is transcribed on the reverse strand, in the same direction as KLK1 but opposite to that of KLK2 and KLK3. It encodes a 254-amino acid prepro-serine protease that is most similar (78% identical) to pig enamel matrix serine protease but is also 37% identical to PSA. These data suggest that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is larger than previously thought and also indicate a greater sequence divergence within this family compared with the highly conserved rodent kallikrein genes.
prostate - specific	PSA	Localization of a new prostate-specific antigen-related serine protease gene, KLK4, is evidence for an expanded human kallikrein gene family cluster on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4.

KLK4 spans 5.2 kb, has an identical genomic structure-five exons and four introns-to the other KLK genes and is transcribed on the reverse strand, in the same direction as KLK1 but opposite to that of KLK2 and KLK3. It encodes a 254-amino acid prepro-serine protease that is most similar (78% identical) to pig enamel matrix serine protease but is also 37% identical to PSA. These data suggest that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is larger than previously thought and also indicate a greater sequence divergence within this family compared with the highly conserved rodent kallikrein genes.
thrombospondin -	TSP1	METH-1, a human ortholog of ADAMTS-1, and METH-2 are members of a new family of proteins with angio-inhibitory activity. We have studied two related proteins that contain a repeated amino acid motif homologous to the anti-angiogenic type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Complete sequence analysis revealed no other similarities with TSP1, but identified unique signal sequences, as well as metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains in the NH(2) termini. We named these proteins METH-1 and METH-2 due to the novel combination of metalloprotease and thrombospondin domains. Overall amino acid sequence identity between METH-1 and METH-2 is 51. 7%, yet transcript distribution revealed non-overlapping patterns of expression in tissues and cultured cell lines. To characterize these proteins functionally, we isolated full-length cDNAs, produced recombinant protein, and generated antisera to the recombinant proteins. Both METH-1 and METH-2 represent single copy genes, which encode secreted and proteolytically processed proteins. METH proteins suppressed fibroblast growth factor-2-induced vascularization in the cornea pocket assay and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Suppression of vessel growth in both assays was considerably greater than that mediated by either thrombospondin-1 or endostatin on a molar basis. Consistent with an endothelial specific response, METH-1 and METH-2 were shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, but not fibroblast or smooth muscle growth. We propose that METH-1 and METH-2 represent a new family of proteins with metalloprotease, disintegrin, and thrombospondin domains. The distinct distribution of each gene product suggests that each has evolved distinct regulatory mechanisms that potentially allow for fine control of activity during distinct physiological and pathological states.
protein kinase cepsilo	PKCepsilon	Involvement of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) in thyroid cell death. A truncated chimeric PKCepsilon cloned from a thyroid cancer cell line protects thyroid cells from apoptosis. The protein kinase C (PKC) family has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. However, the contribution of individual PKC isozymes to this process is not well understood. We reported amplification of the chromosome 2p21 locus in 28% of thyroid neoplasms, and in the WRO thyroid carcinoma cell line. By positional cloning we identified a rearrangement and amplification of the PKCepsilon gene, that maps to 2p21, in WRO cells. This resulted in the overexpression of a chimeric/truncated PKCepsilon (Tr-PKCepsilon) mRNA, coding for N-terminal amino acids 1-116 of the isozyme fused to an unrelated sequence. Expression of the Tr-PKCepsilon protein in PCCL3 cells inhibited activation-induced translocation of endogenous PKCepsilon, but its kinase activity was unaffected, consistent with a dominant negative effect of the mutant protein on activation-induced translocation of wild-type PKCepsilon and/or displacement of the isozyme to an aberrant subcellular location. Cell lines expressing Tr-PKCepsilon grew to a higher saturation density than controls. Moreover, cells expressing Tr-PKCepsilon were resistant to apoptosis, which was associated with higher Bcl-2 levels, a marked impairment in p53 stabilization, and dampened expression of Bax. These findings point to a role for PKCepsilon in apoptosis-signaling pathways in thyroid cells, and indicate that a naturally occurring PKCepsilon mutant that functions as a dominant negative can block cell death triggered by a variety of stimuli.

murine transcription factor friend - of - gata -	mFOG-1	hFOG-2, a novel zinc finger protein, binds the co-repressor mCtBP2 and modulates GATA-mediated activation. We have identified a novel human zinc finger protein, hFOG-2, which is related to but distinct from the murine transcription factor Friend-of-GATA-1 (mFOG-1). The hFOG-2 gene was initially detected in K562 cells using a polymerase chain reaction approach with degenerate primers corresponding to zinc finger regions of mFOG-1. A murine homologue of hFOG-2 was also identified in the mouse expressed sequence tag data banks, indicating that a family of FOG genes exists in mammals. hFOG-2 appears to be widely expressed, while mFOG-1 is expressed primarily in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells and plays a fundamental role in the development of these lineages. Sequencing of the full-length hFOG-2 cDNA indicates that the interaction domains for transcription factors GATA-1 and mCtBP2 are both conserved and we have shown that this new FOG protein also physically interacts with these factors. We have demonstrated that hFOG-2, like mFOG-1, can act in concert with GATA-1 to activate gene expression from the p45 NF-E2 promoter region, but that it can also act to repress GATA-mediated activation of additional reporter constructs. Finally, we have identified a repression domain in hFOG-2 and show that repression is dependent upon the integrity of the mCtBP2 interaction motif Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser.
spinocerebellar ataxia type	SCA7	Nuclear localization of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 protein, ataxin-7. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to a group of neurological disorders caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the associated gene. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of SCA7 and possible functions of ataxin-7, we examined the subcellular localization of ataxin-7 in transfected COS-1 cells using SCA7 cDNA clones with different CAG repeat tract lengths. In addition to a diffuse distribution throughout the nucleus, ataxin-7 associated with the nuclear matrix and the nucleolus. The location of the putative SCA7 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was confirmed by fusing an ataxin-7 fragment with the normally cytoplasmic protein chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. Mutation of this NLS prevented protein from entering the nucleus. Thus, expanded ataxin-7 may carry out its pathogenic effects in the nucleus by altering a matrix-associated nuclear structure and/or by disrupting nucleolar function.

4 . 5 kilobase	kb	Cloning and functional expression of a human Na(+) and Cl(-)-dependent neutral and cationic amino acid transporter B(0+). A Na(+)-dependent neutral and cationic amino acid transport system (B(0+)) plays an important role in many cells and tissues; however, the molecular basis for this transport system is still unknown. To identify new transporters, the expressed sequence tag database was queried, and cDNA fragments with sequence similarity to the Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family were identified. Based on these sequences, rapid amplification of cDNA ends of human mammary gland cDNA was used to obtain a cDNA of 4.5 kilobases (kb). The open reading frame encodes a 642-amino acid protein named amino acid transporter B(0+). Human ATB(0+) (hATB(0+)) is a novel member of the Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family with the highest sequence similarity to the glycine and proline transporters. Northern blot analysis identified transcripts of approximately 4.5 kb and approximately 2 kb in the lung. Another tissue survey suggests expression in the trachea, salivary gland, mammary gland, stomach, and pituitary gland. Electrophysiology and radiolabeled amino acid uptake measurements were used to functionally characterize the transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. hATB(0+) was found to transport both neutral and cationic amino acids, with the highest affinity for hydrophobic amino acids and the lowest affinity for proline. Amino acid transport was Na(+) and Cl(-)-dependent and was attenuated in the presence of 2-aminobicyclo-[2.2.1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a system B(0+) inhibitor. These characteristics are consistent with system B(0+) amino acid transport. Thus, hATB(0+) is the first cloned B(0+) amino acid transporter.

extracellular signal - regulated kinase	ERK2	M-Ras/R-Ras3, a transforming ras protein regulated by Sos1, GRF1, and p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein, interacts with the putative Ras effector AF6. M-Ras is a Ras-related protein that shares approximately 55% identity with K-Ras and TC21. The M-Ras message was widely expressed but was most predominant in ovary and brain. Similarly to Ha-Ras, expression of mutationally activated M-Ras in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts or C2 myoblasts resulted in cellular transformation or inhibition of differentiation, respectively. M-Ras only weakly activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), but it cooperated with Raf, Rac, and Rho to induce transforming foci in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that M-Ras signaled via alternate pathways to these effectors. Although the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, blocked M-Ras-induced transformation, M-Ras was more effective than an activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase mutant at inducing focus formation. These data indicate that multiple pathways must contribute to M-Ras-induced transformation. M-Ras interacted poorly in a yeast two-hybrid assay with multiple Ras effectors, including c-Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, phosphoinositol-3 kinase delta, RalGDS, and Rin1. Although M-Ras coimmunoprecipitated with AF6, a putative regulator of cell junction formation, overexpression of AF6 did not contribute to fibroblast transformation, suggesting the possibility of novel effector proteins. The M-Ras GTP/GDP cycle was sensitive to the Ras GEFs, Sos1, and GRF1 and to p120 Ras GAP. Together, these findings suggest that while M-Ras is regulated by similar upstream stimuli to Ha-Ras, novel targets may be responsible for its effects on cellular transformation and differentiation.
myeloid dap12 - associating lect	MDL	Myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL)-1 is a cell surface receptor involved in the activation of myeloid cells. Crosslinking of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing receptor complexes on a variety of cells leads to their activation through the sequential triggering of protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, DAP12 has been identified as an ITAM-bearing signaling molecule that is noncovalently associated with activating isoforms of MHC class I receptors on natural killer cells. In addition to natural killer cells, DAP12 is expressed in peripheral blood monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, suggesting association with other receptors present in these cell types. In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of the myeloid DAP12-associating lectin-1 (MDL-1), a DAP12-associating membrane receptor expressed exclusively in monocytes and macrophages. MDL-1 is a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the C type lectin superfamily and contains a charged residue in the transmembrane region that enables it to pair with DAP12. Crosslinking of MDL-1/DAP12 complexes in J774 mouse macrophage cells resulted in calcium mobilization. These findings suggest that signaling via MDL-1/DAP12 complexes may constitute a significant activation pathway in myeloid cells.

gamma - aminobutyric acid type	GABA-A	theta, a novel gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit. gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors are a major mediator of inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system, and the site of action of a number of clinically important drugs. These receptors exist as a family of subtypes with distinct temporal and spatial patterns of expression and distinct properties that presumably underlie a precise role for each subtype. The newest member of this gene family is the theta subunit. The deduced polypeptide sequence is 627 amino acids long and has highest sequence identity (50.5%) with the beta1 subunit. Within the rat striatum, this subunit coassembles with alpha2, beta1, and gamma1, suggesting that gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors consisting of arrangements other than alpha beta + gamma, delta, or epsilon do exist. Expression of alpha2beta1gamma1theta in transfected mammalian cells leads to the formation of receptors with a 4-fold decrease in the affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid compared with alpha2beta1gamma1. This subunit has a unique distribution, with studies so far suggesting significant expression within monoaminergic neurons of both human and monkey brain.
peptide methionine sulfoxide reduc	hMsrA	Molecular cloning and functional expression of a human peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (hMsrA). Oxidation of methionine residues in proteins to methionine sulfoxide can be reversed by the enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA, EC 1.8.4.6). We cloned the gene encoding a human homologue (hMsrA) of the enzyme, which has an 88% amino acid sequence identity to the bovine version (bMsrA). With dot blot analyses based on RNA from human tissues, expression of hMsrA was found in all tissues tested, with highest mRNA levels in adult kidney and cerebellum, followed by liver, heart ventricles, bone marrow and hippocampus. In fetal tissue, expression was highest in the liver. No expression of hmsrA was detected in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. To test if hMsrA is functional in cells, we assayed its effect on the inactivation time course of the A-type potassium channel ShC/B since this channel property strongly depends on the oxidative state of a methionine residue in the N-terminal part of the polypeptide. Co-expression of ShC/B and hMsrA in Xenopus oocytes significantly accelerated inactivation, showing that the cloned enzyme is functional in an in vivo assay system. Furthermore, the activity of a purified glutathione-S-transferase-hMsrA fusion protein was demonstrated in vitro by measuring the reduction of [3H]N-acetyl methionine sulfoxide.

beta ( muscle	beta(m)	Identification of a novel gene of the X,K-ATPase beta-subunit family that is predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscles. We have identified the fifth member of the mammalian X,K-ATPase beta-subunit gene family. The human and rat genes are largely expressed in skeletal muscle and at a lower level in heart. The deduced human and rat proteins designated as beta(muscle) (beta(m)) consist of 357 and 356 amino acid residues, respectively, and exhibit 89% identity. The sequence homology of beta(m) proteins with known Na,K- and H,K-ATPase beta-subunits are 30.5-39.4%. Unlike other beta-subunits, putative beta(m) proteins have large N-terminal cytoplasmic domains containing long Glu-rich sequences. The data obtained indicate the existence of hitherto unknown X,K-ATPase (most probably Na,K-ATPase) isozymes in muscle cells.
autocrine motility factor	AMFR	The autocrine motility factor receptor gene encodes a novel type of seven transmembrane protein. Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) is a cell surface glycoprotein of molecular weight 78,000 (gp78), mediating cell motility signaling in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Here, we cloned the full-length cDNAs for both human and mouse AMFR genes. Both genes encode a protein of 643 amino acids containing a seven transmembrane domain, a RING-H2 motif and a leucine zipper motif and showed a 94.7% amino acid sequence identity to each other. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of AMFR with protein databases revealed no significant homology with all known seven transmembrane proteins, but a significant structural similarity to a hypothetical protein of Caenorhabditis elegans, F26E4.11. Thus, AMFR is a highly conserved gene which encodes a novel type of seven transmembrane protein.
beta - defensin -	HBD-1	Molecular cloning and characterization of rat genes encoding homologues of human beta-defensins. beta-Defensins are cationic peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that may play a role in mucosal defenses of several organs. They have been isolated in several species, and in humans, two beta-defensins have been identified. Here, we report the identification of two genes encoding beta-defensin homologues in the rat. Partial cDNAs were found by searching the expressed-sequence-tag database, and primers were designed to generate full-length mRNA coding sequences. One gene was highly similar to the human beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1) gene and mouse beta-defensin-1 gene at both the nucleic acid and amino acid levels and was termed rat beta-defensin-1 (RBD-1). The other gene, named RBD-2, was homologous to the HBD-2 and bovine tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) genes. The predicted prepropeptides were strongly cationic, were 69 and 63 residues in length for RBD-1 and RBD-2, respectively, and contained the six-cysteine motif characteristic of beta-defensins. The beta-defensin genes mapped closely on rat chromosome 16 and were closely linked to the alpha-defensins genes, suggesting that they are part of a gene cluster, similar to the organization reported for humans. Northern blot analysis showed that both RBD-1 and RBD-2 mRNA transcripts were approximately 0.5 kb in length; RBD-1 mRNA was abundantly transcribed in the rat kidney, while RBD-2 was prevalent in the lung. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that RBD-1 and RBD-2 mRNAs were distributed in a variety of other tissues. In the lung, RBD-1 mRNA expression localized to the tracheal epithelium while RBD-2 was expressed in alveolar type II cells. In conclusion, we characterized two novel beta-defensin homologues in the rat. The rat may be a useful model to investigate the function and contribution of beta-defensins to host defense in the lung, kidney, and other tissues.

protein	PZ	The protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor is a serpin. In the presence of phospholipid vesicles and calcium ions, protein Z (PZ) serves as a cofactor for the inhibition of coagulation factor Xa by a plasma protein called PZ-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI). To further characterize ZPI, its cDNA has been isolated and cloned from a human liver cDNA library. The ZPI cDNA is 2.44 kb in length and has a relatively long 5' region (466 nt) that contains six potential ATG translation start codons. ATG's 1-4 are followed by short open reading frames, whereas ATG(5) and ATG(6) are in an uninterrupted open reading frame that includes the encoded ZPI protein. In vitro experiments show that ATG(6) is sufficient for the expression of rZPI in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern analysis suggests the liver is a major site of ZPI synthesis. The predicted 423 residue amino acid sequence of the mature ZPI protein is 25-35% homologous with members of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors and is 78% identical to the amino acid sequence predicted by a previously described cDNA isolated from rat liver, regeneration-associated serpin protein-1 (rasp-1). Thus, ZPI is likely the human homologue of rat rasp-1. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of ZPI with those of other serpins predicts that Y387 is the P(1) residue at the reactive center of the ZPI molecule. Consistent with this notion, rZPI(Y387A), an altered form of ZPI in which tyrosine 387 has been changed to alanine, lacks PZ-dependent factor Xa inhibitory activity.

In vitro experiments show that ATG(6) is sufficient for the expression of rZPI in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern analysis suggests the liver is a major site of ZPI synthesis. The predicted 423 residue amino acid sequence of the mature ZPI protein is 25-35% homologous with members of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors and is 78% identical to the amino acid sequence predicted by a previously described cDNA isolated from rat liver, regeneration-associated serpin protein-1 (rasp-1). Thus, ZPI is likely the human homologue of rat rasp-1. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of ZPI with those of other serpins predicts that Y387 is the P(1) residue at the reactive center of the ZPI molecule. Consistent with this notion, rZPI(Y387A), an altered form of ZPI in which tyrosine 387 has been changed to alanine, lacks PZ-dependent factor Xa inhibitory activity.
human kallikr	hK	Identification of a novel complex between human kallikrein 2 and protease inhibitor-6 in prostate cancer tissue. Human kallikrein (hK) 2 is an arginine-selective serine protease expressed predominantly in the prostate that has an 80% sequence identity with prostate-specific antigen. Expression of hK2 is elevated in the tumor epithelium compared to benign prostate tissue. We have purified, sequenced, and identified a novel hK2 complex in prostate tissue consisting of hK2 and a serine protease inhibitor known as protease inhibitor-6 (PI-6). This 64-kDa SDS-PAGE stable complex is elevated in the tumor and is approximately 10% of total hK2. No comparable complex of prostate-specific antigen was detected. PI-6, also known as cytoplasmic antiprotease, has been characterized as an intracellular inhibitor of trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases, which has high homology to plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and 2. The physiological role of PI-6 in the prostate and its relationship to hK2 and prostate cancer are under investigation.

macrophage inflammatory protein -	MIP-2	Novel CXCR2-dependent liver regenerative qualities of ELR-containing CXC chemokines. Severe acute liver injury due to accidental or intentional acetaminophen overdose presents a major clinical dilemma often requiring liver transplantation. In the present study, liver regeneration after profound liver injury in mice challenged with acetaminophen was facilitated by the exogenous addition of ELR-containing CXC chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), epithelial neutrophil-activating protein-78 (ENA-78), or interleukin 8. Intravenous administration of ELR-CXC chemokines or N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) immediately after acetaminophen challenge in mice significantly reduced histological and biochemical markers of hepatic injury. However, when the intervention was delayed until 10 h after acetaminophen challenge, only ELR-CXC chemokines significantly reduced liver injury and mouse mortality. The delayed addition of ELR-CXC chemokines to cultured hepatocytes maintained the proliferation of these cells in a CXCR2-dependent fashion after acetaminophen challenge whereas delayed NAC treatment did not. These observations demonstrate that ELR-CXC chemokines represent novel hepatic regenerative factors that exhibit prolonged therapeutic effects after acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.

longjo	lgj	Three new allelic mouse mutations that cause skeletal overgrowth involve the natriuretic peptide receptor C gene (Npr3). In 1979, a BALB/cJ mouse was identified with an exceptionally long body. This phenotype was found to be caused by a recessive mutation, designated longjohn (lgj), that mapped to the proximal region of chromosome 15. Several years later, a mouse with a similarly elongated body was identified in an outbred stock after chemical mutagenesis with ethylnitrosourea. This phenotype also was caused by a recessive mutation, designated strigosus (stri). The two mutations were found to be allelic. A third allele was identified in a DBA/2J mouse and was designated longjohn-2J (lgj(2J)). Analysis of skeletal preparations of stri/stri mice indicated that the endochondral ossification process was slightly delayed, resulting in an extended proliferation zone. A recent study reported that mice overexpressing brain natriuretic peptide, one of the members of the natriuretic peptide family, exhibit a skeletal-overgrowth syndrome with endochondral ossification defects. The Npr3 gene coding for type C receptor for natriuretic peptides (NPR-C), which is mainly involved in the clearance of the natriuretic peptides, mapped in the vicinity of our mouse mutations and thus was a candidate gene. The present study reports that all three mutations involve the Npr3 gene and provides evidence in vivo that there is a natriuretic-related bone pathway, underscoring the importance of natriuretic peptide clearance by natriuretic peptide type C receptor.

prostagland	PG	Abortive expansion of the cumulus and impaired fertility in mice lacking the prostaglandin E receptor subtype EP(2). Female mice lacking the gene encoding the prostaglandin (PG) E(2) receptor subtype EP(2) (EP(2)(-/-)) become pregnant and deliver their pups at term, but with a much reduced litter size. A decrease in ovulation number and a much reduced fertilization rate were observed in EP(2)(-/-) females without difference of the uterus to support implantation of wild-type embryos. Treatment with gonadotropins induced EP(2) mRNA expression in the cumulus cells of ovarian follicles of wild-type mice. The immature cumuli oophori from wild-type mice expanded in vitro in response to both follicle-stimulating hormone and PGE(2), but the response to PGE(2) was absent in those from EP(2)(-/-) mice. Cumulus expansion proceeded normally in preovulatory follicles but became abortive in a number of ovulated complexes in EP(2)(-/-) mice, indicating that EP(2) is involved in cumulus expansion in the oviduct in vivo. No difference in the fertilization rate between wild-type and EP(2)(-/-) mice was found in in vitro studies using cumulus-free oocytes. These results indicate that PGE(2) cooperates with gonadotropin to complete cumulus expansion for successful fertilization.

rat very long - chain acyl - coa syntheta	rVLCS	Human very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and two human homologs: initial characterization and relationship to fatty acid transport protein. Several human genes with a high degree of homology to rat very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (rVLCS) and mouse fatty acid transport protein (mFATP) were identified. Full-length cDNA clones were obtained for three genes, and predicted amino acid sequences were generated. Initial characterization indicated that one gene was most likely hVLCS, the human ortholog of rVLCS. The other two (hVLCS-H1 and hVLCS-H2) were more closely related to rVLCS than to mFATP. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences confirmed that hVLCS-H1 and hVLCS-H2 were evolutionarily closer to VLCSs than FATPs. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences of human, rat and mouse VLCSs and FATPs revealed the existence of two highly conserved motifs. While one motif is also present in long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, the other serves to distinguish the VLCS/FATP family from the long-chain synthetase family. Elucidation of the biochemical functions of all VLCS/FATP family members should provide new insights into cellular fatty acid metabolism.

g protein - coupled	GPCRs	Ocular albinism: evidence for a defect in an intracellular signal transduction system. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) participate in the most common signal transduction system at the plasma membrane. The wide distribution of heterotrimeric G proteins in the internal membranes suggests that a similar signalling mechanism might also be used at intracellular locations. We provide here structural evidence that the protein product of the ocular albinism type 1 gene (OA1), a pigment cell-specific integral membrane glycoprotein, represents a novel member of the GPCR superfamily and demonstrate that it binds heterotrimeric G proteins. Moreover, we show that OA1 is not found at the plasma membrane, being instead targeted to specialized intracellular organelles, the melanosomes. Our data suggest that OA1 represents the first example of an exclusively intracellular GPCR and support the hypothesis that GPCR-mediated signal transduction systems also operate at the internal membranes in mammalian cells.

guanosine triphos	GTP	Genetic screens in yeast to identify mammalian nonreceptor modulators of G-protein signaling. We describe genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae designed to identify mammalian nonreceptor modulators of G-protein signaling pathways. Strains lacking a pheromone-responsive G-protein coupled receptor and expressing a mammalian-yeast Galpha hybrid protein were made conditional for growth upon either pheromone pathway activation (activator screen) or pheromone pathway inactivation (inhibitor screen). Mammalian cDNAs that conferred plasmid-dependent growth under restrictive conditions were identified. One of the cDNAs identified from the activator screen, a human Ras-related G protein that we term AGS1 (for activator of G-protein signaling), appears to function by facilitating guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange on the heterotrimeric Galpha. A cDNA product identified from the inhibitor screen encodes a previously identified regulator of G-protein signaling, human RGS5.
double -	ds	JAZ requires the double-stranded RNA-binding zinc finger motifs for nuclear localization. We have cloned and characterized a novel zinc finger protein, termed JAZ. JAZ contains four C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs that are connected by long (28-38) amino acid linker sequences. JAZ is expressed in all tissues tested and localizes in the nucleus, primarily the nucleolus. JAZ preferentially binds to double-stranded (ds) RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids rather than DNA. Mutation of individual zinc finger motifs reveals that the zinc finger domains are not only essential for dsRNA binding but are also required for its nucleolar localization, which demonstrates a complex trafficking mechanism dependent on the nucleic acid-binding capability of the protein. Furthermore, forced expression of JAZ potently induces apoptosis in murine fibroblast cells. Thus, JAZ may belong to a class of zinc finger proteins that features dsRNA binding and may regulate cell growth via the unique dsRNA binding properties.
tgf - beta - stimulated clone -	TSC-22	Transforming growth factor-beta-stimulated clone-22 is a member of a family of leucine zipper proteins that can homo- and heterodimerize and has transcriptional repressor activity. TGF-beta-stimulated clone-22 (TSC-22) encodes a leucine zipper-containing protein that is highly conserved during evolution. Two homologues are known that share a similar leucine zipper domain and another conserved domain (designated the TSC box). Only limited data are available on the function of TSC-22 and its homologues. TSC-22 is transcriptionally up-regulated by many different stimuli, including anti-cancer drugs and growth inhibitors, and recent data suggest that TSC-22 may play a suppressive role in tumorigenesis. In this paper we show that TSC-22 forms homodimers via its conserved leucine zipper domain. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a TSC-22 homologue (THG-1) as heterodimeric partner. Furthermore, we report the presence of two more mammalian family members with highly conserved leucine zippers and TSC boxes. Interestingly, both TSC-22 and THG-1 have transcriptional repressor activity when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The repressor activity of TSC-22 appears sensitive for promoter architecture, but not for the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Mutational analysis showed that this repressor activity resides in the non-conserved regions of the protein and is enhanced by the conserved dimerization domain. Our results suggest that TSC-22 belongs to a family of leucine zipper-containing transcription factors that can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other family members and that at least two TSC-22 family members may be repressors of transcription.
arf - like	ARL2	The ARF-like 2 (ARL2)-binding protein, BART. Purification, cloning, and initial characterization. ARF-like proteins (ARLs) comprise a functionally distinct group of incompletely characterized members in the ARF family of RAS-related GTPases. We took advantage of the GTP binding characteristics of human ARL2 to develop a specific, high affinity binding assay that allowed the purification of a novel ARL2-binding protein. A 19-kDa protein (BART, Binder of Arl Two) was identified and purified from bovine brain homogenate. BART binding is specific to ARL2.GTP with high affinity but does not interact with ARL2.GDP or activated ARF or RHO proteins. Based on peptide sequences of purified bovine BART, the human cDNA sequence was determined. The 489-base pair BART open reading frame encodes a novel 163-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18,822 Da. Recombinant BART was found to bind ARL2.GTP in a manner indistinguishable from native BART. Northern and Western analyses indicated BART is expressed in all tissues sampled. The lack of detectable membrane association of ARL2 or BART upon activation of ARL2 is suggestive of actions quite distinct from those of the ARFs. The lack of ARL2 GTPase-activating protein activity in BART led us to conclude that the specific interaction with ARL2.GTP is most consistent with BART being the first identified ARL2-specific effector.

peptidylarginine deimina	PAD	Molecular characterization of peptidylarginine deiminase in HL-60 cells induced by retinoic acid and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). Three types of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD), which converts a protein arginine residue to a citrulline residue, are widely distributed in animal tissues. Little is known about PAD of hemopoietic cells. We found that PAD activity in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells was induced with the granulocyte-inducing agents retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide and with the monocyte-inducing agent 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). We cloned and characterized a PAD cDNA from retinoic acid-induced cells. The cDNA was 2,238 base pairs long and encoded a 663-amino acid polypeptide. The HL-60 PAD had 50-55% amino acid sequence identities with the three known enzymes and 73% identity with the recently cloned keratinocyte PAD. The recombinant enzyme differs in kinetic properties from the known enzymes. Immunoblotting and Northern blotting with an antiserum against the enzyme and the cDNA, respectively, showed that a protein of approximately 67 kDa increased concomitantly with increase of mRNA of approximately 2.6 kilobases during granulocyte differentiation. During monocyte differentiation the same mRNA and protein increased as in granulocyte differentiation. Neither the enzyme activity nor the protein was found in macrophage-induced cells. These results suggested that expression of the PAD gene is tightly linked to myeloid differentiation.
peptide y	PYY	Y receptor-mediated induction of CD63 transcripts, a tetraspanin determined to be necessary for differentiation of the intestinal epithelial cell line, hBRIE 380i cells. Peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are peptides that coordinate intestinal activities in response to luminal and neuronal signals. In this study, using the rat hybrid small intestinal epithelial cell line, hBRIE 380i cells, we demonstrated that PYY- and NPY-induced rearrangement of actin filaments may be in part through a Y1alpha and/or a nonneuronal Y2 receptor, which were cloned from both the intestinal mucosa and the hBRIE 380i cells. A number of PYY/NPY-responsive genes were also identified by subtractive hybridization of the hBRIE 380i cells in the presence or absence of a 6-h treatment with PYY. Several of these genes coded for proteins associated with the cell cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix. One of these proteins was the transmembrane-4 superfamily protein CD63, previously shown to associate with beta(1)-integrin and implicated in cell adhesion. CD63 immunoreactivity, using antibody to the extracellular domain, was highest in the differentiated cell clusters of the hBRIE 380i cells. The hBRIE 380i cells transfected with antisense CD63 cDNA lost these differentiated clusters. These studies suggest a new role for NPY and PYY in modulating differentiation through cytoskeletal associated proteins.

thyroid hormone	TR	NRIF3 is a novel coactivator mediating functional specificity of nuclear hormone receptors. Many nuclear receptors are capable of recognizing similar DNA elements. The molecular event(s) underlying the functional specificities of these receptors (in regulating the expression of their native target genes) is a very important issue that remains poorly understood. Here we report the cloning and analysis of a novel nuclear receptor coactivator (designated NRIF3) that exhibits a distinct receptor specificity. Fluorescence microscopy shows that NRIF3 localizes to the cell nucleus. The yeast two-hybrid and/or in vitro binding assays indicated that NRIF3 specifically interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a ligand-dependent fashion but does not bind to the retinoic acid receptor, vitamin D receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, or estrogen receptor. Functional experiments showed that NRIF3 significantly potentiates TR- and RXR-mediated transactivation in vivo but has little effect on other examined nuclear receptors. Domain and mutagenesis analyses indicated that a novel C-terminal domain in NRIF3 plays an essential role in its specific interaction with liganded TR and RXR while the N-terminal LXXLL motif plays a minor role in allowing optimum interaction. Computer modeling and subsequent experimental analysis suggested that the C-terminal domain of NRIF3 directly mediates interaction with liganded receptors through an LXXIL (a variant of the canonical LXXLL) module while the other part of the NRIF3 protein may still play a role in conferring its receptor specificity. Identification of a coactivator with such a unique receptor specificity may provide new insight into the molecular mechanism(s) of receptor-mediated transcriptional activation as well as the functional specificities of nuclear receptors.

phosphatidylinositol 3 -	PI3K	Identification of a chromosome 3p14.3-21.1 gene, APPL, encoding an adaptor molecule that interacts with the oncoprotein-serine/threonine kinase AKT2. AKT2 is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in human ovarian and pancreatic cancers. AKT2 is activated by a variety of growth factors and insulin via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). However, its normal cellular role is not well understood. To gain insight into the function of AKT2, we performed yeast two-hybrid system to screen for interacting proteins. Using this technique, we identified a novel interactor, designated APPL, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a leucine zipper, classes of motifs defined in signaling molecules as functional interaction domains with specific targets. The PH domain of APPL shows similarity to those found in GTPase-activating proteins such as oligophrenin-1 and Graf, whereas its PTB domain exhibits homology with CED-6, an adaptor protein that promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells, and IB1, a transactivator of the GLUT2 gene. APPL is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, ovary and pancreas, tissues in which AKT2 mRNA is abundant. APPL interacts with the inactive form of AKT2; moreover, APPL binds to the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110alpha. These data suggest that APPL is an adaptor that may tether inactive AKT2 to p110alpha in the cytoplasm and thereby may expedite recruitment of AKT2 and p110alpha to the cell membrane upon mitogenic stimulation. Furthermore, the APPL gene was mapped to human chromosome 3p14.3-p21.1, where deletions and other rearrangements have often been reported in a variety of tumor types. The identification of APPL may facilitate further analysis of the physiological and oncogenic activities of AKT2.

AKT2 is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in human ovarian and pancreatic cancers. AKT2 is activated by a variety of growth factors and insulin via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). However, its normal cellular role is not well understood. To gain insight into the function of AKT2, we performed yeast two-hybrid system to screen for interacting proteins. Using this technique, we identified a novel interactor, designated APPL, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a leucine zipper, classes of motifs defined in signaling molecules as functional interaction domains with specific targets. The PH domain of APPL shows similarity to those found in GTPase-activating proteins such as oligophrenin-1 and Graf, whereas its PTB domain exhibits homology with CED-6, an adaptor protein that promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells, and IB1, a transactivator of the GLUT2 gene. APPL is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, ovary and pancreas, tissues in which AKT2 mRNA is abundant. APPL interacts with the inactive form of AKT2; moreover, APPL binds to the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110alpha. These data suggest that APPL is an adaptor that may tether inactive AKT2 to p110alpha in the cytoplasm and thereby may expedite recruitment of AKT2 and p110alpha to the cell membrane upon mitogenic stimulation. Furthermore, the APPL gene was mapped to human chromosome 3p14.3-p21.1, where deletions and other rearrangements have often been reported in a variety of tumor types. The identification of APPL may facilitate further analysis of the physiological and oncogenic activities of AKT2.

c - c chemokine receptor	CCR5	TNF-alpha inhibits HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages by inducing the production of RANTES and decreasing C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) expression. The pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is influenced by the immunoregulatory responses of the host. Macrophages present in the lymphoid tissue are susceptible to infection with HIV-1, but are relatively resistant to its cytopathic effects and serve as a reservoir for the virus during the course of disease. Previous investigators have demonstrated that increased serum levels of TNF-alpha contribute to the clinical symptoms of AIDS and that TNF-alpha stimulates the production of HIV-1 in chronically infected lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines by increasing HIV-1 gene expression. Although previous studies have suggested that TNF-alpha may increase HIV-1 infection of primary human mononuclear cells, some recent studies have indicated that TNF-alpha suppresses HIV-1 infection of macrophages. We now demonstrate that TNF-alpha suppresses HIV-1 replication in freshly infected peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and alveolar macrophages (AM) in a dose-dependent manner. As TNF-alpha has been shown to increase the production of C-C chemokine receptor (CCR5)-binding chemokines under certain circumstances, we hypothesized that TNF-alpha inhibits HIV-1 replication by increasing the expression of these HIV-suppressive factors. We now show that TNF-alpha treatment of PBM and AM increases the production of the C-C chemokine, RANTES. Immunodepletion of RANTES alone or in combination with macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and -1beta block the ability of TNF-alpha to suppress viral replication in PBM and AM. In addition, we found that TNF-alpha treatment reduces CCR5 expression on PBM and AM. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha plays a significant role in inhibiting monocytotropic strains of HIV-1 by two distinct, but complementary, mechanisms.

phosphatidylinositol 3 -	PI3-kinase	Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha-induced lymphocyte polarization and chemotaxis. The role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), an important enzyme involved in signal transduction events, has been studied in the polarization and chemotaxis of lymphocytes induced by the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha). This chemokine was able to directly activate p85/p110 PI3-kinase in whole human PBL and to induce the association of PI3-kinase to the SDF-1 alpha receptor, CXCR4, in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Two unrelated chemical inhibitors of PI3-kinase, wortmannin and Ly294002, prevented ICAM-3 and ERM protein moesin polarization as well as the chemotaxis of PBL in response to SDF-1 alpha. However, they did not interfere with the reorganization of either tubulin or the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, the transient expression of a dominant negative form of the PI3-kinase 85-kDa regulatory subunit in the constitutively polarized Peer T cell line inhibited ICAM-3 polarization and markedly reduced SDF-1 alpha-induced chemotaxis. Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively activated mutant of the PI3-kinase 110-kDa catalytic subunit in the round-shaped PM-1 T cell line induced ICAM-3 polarization. These results underline the role of PI3-kinase in the regulation of lymphocyte polarization and motility and indicate that PI3-kinase plays a selective role in the regulation of adhesion and ERM proteins redistribution in the plasma membrane of lymphocytes.

early endosomal autoant	EEA1	Direct interaction of EEA1 with Rab5b. The early endosomal autoantigen EEA1 is essential for early endosomal membrane fusion. It binds to endosomes via a C-terminal domain (EEA1-CT). To identify proteins interacting with EEA1-CT, we screened a human brain library in the yeast two-hybrid system. Fourteen clones reacted strongly with EEA1-CT. Sequencing of these clones revealed that they all contained the ORF of the small GTPase, Rab5b. Further two-hybrid analysis suggested that Rab5b also interacts with the N-terminus of EEA1 (EEA1-NT). The interaction of both EEA1-CT and EEA1-NT with Rab5b was confirmed biochemically, and was found to be GTP dependent. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that EEA1 colocalizes with Rab5b on early endosomes. Although EEA1-CT and EEA1-NT interacted strongly with wild-type Rab5b in the two-hybrid system, we detected no interaction with wild-type Rab5a, even though GTPase-deficient mutants of both Rab5a and Rab5b interacted equally well with EEA1. This difference could not be explained by differences in intrinsic GTPase activities, as these were found to be very similar. Instead, we speculate that yeast may contain a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity that stimulates Rab5a but not Rab5b. In contrast, pig brain cytosol was found to contain a GAP activity that stimulates the GTPase activity of Rab5b in preference to that of Rab5a. These data provide evidence that EEA1 interacts with both Rab5a and Rab5b, and that the GTPase activities of the two proteins are differentially regulated in vivo.

thyrotropin - releasing	TRH	Human TRH-degrading ectoenzyme cDNA cloning, functional expression, genomic structure and chromosomal assignment. Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) is an important extracellular signal substance that acts as a stimulator of hormone secretion from adenohypophyseal target cells and fulfills many criteria for the function of a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter within the central and peripheral nervous systems. The inactivation of TRH-signals is catalysed by a highly specific ectoenzyme. Here, we characterize the human TRH-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE) by primary sequence, functional expression, genomic structure and chromosomal assignment. By screening a cDNA-library constructed from human lung, 5.7 kb of cDNA were identified. The longest open reading frame predicts a type II integral membrane protein of 117 kDa. The extracellular domain contains the HEXXH + E motif that is characteristic of a certain family of Zn-dependent aminopeptidases. Within this family, the sequences of human and rat TRH-DE reveal an unusual high degree of conservation (96% identical residues). Specific enzymatic activity was observed after transfecting COS-7 cells with human TRH-DE cDNA yielding a Km for TRH hydrolysis of 29.7 microM. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a restricted tissue distribution with highest transcript levels in the brain. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization with the cDNA and a genomic lambda clone, respectively, we localized the TRH-DE gene to the long arm of human chromosome 12. Five independent P1 artificial chromosome clones were required to span the complete cDNA sequence and revealed that it is distributed on 19 exons. Interspecies Southern analysis suggests that the gene is present as a single copy in human, monkey, rat, mouse, dog, bovine, rabbit and chicken DNA. All of these data further the notion that the TRH-DE is not an ordinary enzyme but a specific neuropeptidase that has been highly conserved among species.

gal / galnac / glcnac 6 - o - sulfotransfera	GST	Cloning and characterization of a mammalian N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase that is highly restricted to intestinal tissue. Using the sequences of a galactose 6-O-sulfotransferase and an N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase as probes in an EST approach, we have identified a highly related cDNA in human and an apparent orthologue in mouse. The cDNAs predict type II transmembrane proteins that constitute new members of the Gal/GalNAc/GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (GST) family. Members of this family have previously been implicated in the sulfation of GAG chains within proteoglycans and the sulfation of O-linked chains within sialomucin ligands for l-selectin. Expression of the newly identified cDNA in COS cells led to the addition of sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in an acceptor glycoprotein. The tissue expression of transcripts corresponding to the cDNA was highly restricted to the small intestine and colon in humans. Based on these characteristics, the novel sulfotransferase is designated I-GlcNAc6ST for intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase.
nitric oxide synthase	NOS	Identification of two human dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases with distinct tissue distributions and homology with microbial arginine deiminases. Methylarginines inhibit nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Cellular concentrations of methylarginines are determined in part by the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH; EC 3.5.3. 18). We have cloned human DDAH and identified and expressed a second novel DDAH isoform (DDAH I and II respectively). DDAH I predominates in tissues that express neuronal NOS. DDAH II predominates in tissues expressing endothelial NOS. These results strengthen the hypothesis that methylarginine concentration is actively regulated and identify molecular targets for the tissue and cell-specific regulation of methylarginine concentration.

proline synthetase co -	PROSC	Cloning and characterization of human and mouse PROSC (proline synthetase co-transcribed) genes. Large-scale DNA sequencing, coupled with in silico gene trapping, is a robust approach to identifying unknown genes in selected genomic regions. Using this approach we have isolated a novel human gene, PROSC (for proline synthetase co-transcribed [bacterial homolog]), from human chromosome 8p11.2, and its mouse counterpart. The human PROSC gene spanned 17 kb of genomic DNA; its cDNA was 2530 bp long, with 8 exons that included an open reading frame of 825 bp (275 amino acids). The mouse cDNA (Prosc), 1995 bp long, was predicted to encode 274 amino acids. PROSC is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has been highly conserved among divergent species from bacteria to mammals, suggesting its important cellular function. The gene product is likely to be a soluble cytoplasmic protein, but its function remains to be determined.
miyoshi myopa	MM	Dysferlin is a surface membrane-associated protein that is absent in Miyoshi myopathy. Recently we reported that mutations in a muscle protein " dysferlin " are present in limb girdle muscular dystrophy-2B and a related, adult-onset, distal dystrophy known as Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We report that antibodies to dysferlin identify a protein of approximately 230 kDa and show that dysferlin is located in the muscle membrane. This protein is absent in MM and LGMD-2B muscle. By contrast, dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated proteins are normal in these patients. Thus, dysferlin is a membrane-associated protein that is not likely to be an integral component of the dystrophin complex. Although it is not essential for initial myogenesis, it appears to be critical for sustained normal function in mature muscle.
parathyroid hormone	PTH2	Comparison of rat and human parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2) receptor activation: PTH is a low potency partial agonist at the rat PTH2 receptor. The human PTH2 receptor, expressed in tissue culture cells, is selectively activated by PTH. Detailed investigation of its anatomical and cellular distribution has been performed in the rat. It is expressed by neurons in a number of brain nuclei; by endocrine cells that include pancreatic islet somatostatin cells, thyroid parafollicular cells, and peptide secreting cells in the gastrointestinal tract; and by cells in the vasculature and heart. The physiological role of the PTH2 receptor expressed by these cells remains to be determined. All pharmacological studies performed to date have used the human receptor. We have now isolated a complementary DNA including the entire coding sequence of the rat PTH2 receptor and compared its pharmacological profile with that of the human PTH2 receptor when each is expressed in COS-7 cells. PTH-based peptides, including rat PTH(1-84), rat PTH(1-34), and human PTH(1-34), have low potency at the rat PTH2 receptor for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (EC50 = 19-140 nM). When compared with the effect of a bovine hypothalamic extract, PTH-based peptides are partial agonists at the rat PTH2 receptor. This suggests that PTH is unlikely to be a physiologically important endogenous ligand for the PTH2 receptor. A peptide homologous to an activity detected in a bovine hypothalamic extract is a good candidate for the endogenous PTH2 receptor ligand.
immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory	ITIM	Identification and molecular cloning of p75/AIRM1, a novel member of the sialoadhesin family that functions as an inhibitory receptor in human natural killer cells. In this study, by the generation of a specific monoclonal antibody, we identified p75/AIRM1 (for adhesion inhibitory receptor molecule 1), a novel inhibitory receptor that is mostly confined to human natural killer cells. p75/AIRM1 is a 75-kD glycoprotein that, upon sodium pervanadate treatment, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates to src homology 2 domain-bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. The p75/AIRM1 gene is located on human chromosome 19 and encodes a novel member of the sialoadhesin family characterized by three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (one NH(2)-terminal V-type and two C2-type) and a classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic portion. The highest amino acid sequence similarity has been found with the myeloid-specific CD33 molecule and the placental CD33L1 protein. Similar to other sialoadhesin molecules, p75/AIRM1 appears to mediate sialic acid-dependent ligand recognition.
radiation	RH	Conservation of the Caenorhabditis elegans timing gene clk-1 from yeast to human: a gene required for ubiquinone biosynthesis with potential implications for aging. Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans gene clk-1 have a major effect on slowing development and increasing life span. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog COQ7 encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis and, hence, is required for respiration and gluconeogenesis. In this study, RT-PCR and 5' RACE were used to isolate both human and mouse clk-1/COQ7 homologs. Human CLK-1 was mapped to Chr 16(p12-13.1) by Radiation Hybrid (RH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. The number and location of human CLK1 introns were determined, and the location of introns II and IV are the same as in C. elegans. Northern blot analysis showed that three different isoforms of CLK-1 mRNA are present in several tissues and that the isoforms differ in the amount of expression. The functional equivalence of human CLK-1 to the yeast COQ7 homolog was tested by introducing either a single or multicopy plasmid containing human CLK-1 cDNA into yeast coq7 deletion strains and assaying for growth on a nonfermentable carbon source. The human CLK-1 gene was able to functionally complement yeast coq7 deletion mutants. The protein similarities and the conservation of function of the CLK-1/clk-1/COQ7 gene products suggest a potential link between the production of ubiquinone and aging.

rearranged in thyroid adenoma	RITA	A KRAB zinc finger protein gene is the potential target of 19q13 translocation in benign thyroid tumors. In an attempt to identify the target gene of specific translocations involving chromosomal band 19q13 in benign follicular thyroid tumors, we have used two cell lines derived from benign thyroid tumors showing translocations with 19q13 breakpoints for fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping studies with cosmid and PAC clones located in a 400-kbp region. The breakpoints of the chromosome 19 abnormalities mapped within a 140-kb segment covered by a single PAC clone. Sequencing of part of this PAC clone allowed us to establish the cDNA sequence and the genomic structure of a candidate gene located in close vicinity to the breakpoints. The gene that we tentatively refer to as RITA (rearranged in thyroid adenomas) belongs to the KRAB zinc finger protein coding genes. From our results we have concluded that in the two cell lines investigated the breaks have occurred either within the 5' untranslated region of RITA or in its close 5' vicinity. By Northern blot analyses two transcripts of about 4.7 kbp and 5 kbp were detected in normal thyroid tissue as well as in other normal tissues tested. An additional 2.1-kbp transcript was found only in testicular tissue. In contrast to all normal tissues, both cell lines with 19q aberrations expressed larger transcripts of approximately 5.5 kbp and 6.2 kbp. From the close vicinity to the breakpoint region, the expression patterns of the gene, and its type, we consider RITA a strong candidate target gene of the specific 19q aberrations in benign thyroid tumors.
None	PSD	Characterization of the Shank family of synaptic proteins. Multiple genes, alternative splicing, and differential expression in brain and development. Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 constitute a family of proteins that may function as molecular scaffolds in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Shank directly interacts with GKAP and Homer, thus potentially bridging the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-PSD-95-GKAP complex and the mGluR-Homer complex in synapses (Naisbitt, S., Kim, E., Tu, J. C. , Xiao, B., Sala, S., Valtschanoff, J., Weinberg, R. J., Worley, P. F., and Sheng, M. (1999) Neuron 23, 569-582; Tu, J. C., Xiao, B., Naisbitt, S., Yuan, J. P., Petralia, R. S., Brakeman, P., Doan, A., Aakalu, V. K., Lanahan, A. A., Sheng, M., and Worley, P. F. (1999) Neuron 23, 583-592). Shank contains multiple domains for protein-protein interaction including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 domain, a sterile alpha motif domain, and a proline-rich region. By characterizing Shank cDNA clones and RT-PCR products, we found that there are four sites for alternative splicing in Shank1 and another four sites in Shank2, some of which result in deletion of specific domains of the Shank protein. In addition, the expression of the splice variants is differentially regulated in different regions of rat brain during development. Immunoblot analysis of Shank proteins in rat brain using five different Shank antibodies reveals marked heterogeneity in size (120-240 kDa) and differential spatiotemporal expression. Shank1 immunoreactivity is concentrated at excitatory synaptic sites in adult brain, and the punctate staining of Shank1 is seen in developing rat brains as early as postnatal day 7. These results suggest that alternative splicing in the Shank family may be a mechanism that regulates the molecular structure of Shank and the spectrum of Shank-interacting proteins in the PSDs of adult and developing brain.
somatosta	SST	Regulation of acidification and apoptosis by SHP-1 and Bcl-2. Recruitment of the SH2 domain containing cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the membrane by somatostatin (SST) is an early event in its antiproliferative signaling that induces intracellular acidification-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Fas ligation also induces acidification-dependent apoptosis in a manner requiring the presence of SHP-1 at the membrane. Moreover, we have recently reported that SHP-1 is required not only for acidification, but also for apoptotic events that follow acidification (Thangaraju, M., Sharma, K., Liu, D., Shen, S. H., and Srikant, C. B. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 1649-1654). Here we show that ectopically expressed SHP-1 was predominantly membrane-associated and amplified the cytotoxic signaling initiated upon SST receptor activation and Fas ligation. The catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 (SHP-1C455S) abolished the ability of the SST agonists to signal apoptosis by preventing the recruitment of wild type SHP-1 to the membrane. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells inhibited SST-induced apoptosis upstream of acidification by inhibiting p53-dependent induction of Bax as well as by raising the resting pH(i) and attenuating SST-induced decrease in pH(i). By contrast, Bcl-2 failed to prevent apoptosis triggered by direct acidification. These data demonstrate that (i) membrane-associated SHP-1 is required for receptor-mediated cytotoxic signaling that causes intracellular acidification and apoptosis, and (ii) Bcl-2 acts distal to SHP-1 and p53 to prevent SST-induced acidification but cannot inhibit the apoptotic events that ensue intracellular acidification.
cytoplasmic protein - tyrosine phospha	SHP-1	Regulation of acidification and apoptosis by SHP-1 and Bcl-2. Recruitment of the SH2 domain containing cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the membrane by somatostatin (SST) is an early event in its antiproliferative signaling that induces intracellular acidification-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Fas ligation also induces acidification-dependent apoptosis in a manner requiring the presence of SHP-1 at the membrane. Moreover, we have recently reported that SHP-1 is required not only for acidification, but also for apoptotic events that follow acidification (Thangaraju, M., Sharma, K., Liu, D., Shen, S. H., and Srikant, C. B. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 1649-1654). Here we show that ectopically expressed SHP-1 was predominantly membrane-associated and amplified the cytotoxic signaling initiated upon SST receptor activation and Fas ligation. The catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 (SHP-1C455S) abolished the ability of the SST agonists to signal apoptosis by preventing the recruitment of wild type SHP-1 to the membrane.

neutrophil - borne heparin - binding	HBP	Heparin-binding protein targeted to mitochondrial compartments protects endothelial cells from apoptosis. Neutrophil-borne heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a multifunctional protein involved in the progression of inflammation. HBP is stored in neutrophil granules and released upon stimulation of the cells in proximity to endothelial cells. HBP affects endothelial cells in multiple ways; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the interaction of HBP with these cells are unknown. Affinity isolation and enzymatic degradation demonstrated that HBP released from human neutrophils binds to endothelial cell-surface proteoglycans, such as syndecans and glypican. Flow cytometry indicated that a significant fraction of proteoglycan-bound HBP is taken up by the endothelial cells, and we used radiolabeled HBP to determine the internalization rate of surface-bound HBP. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that internalized HBP is targeted to perinuclear compartments of endothelial cells, where it colocalizes with mitochondria. Western blotting of isolated mitochondria from HBP-treated endothelial cells showed that HBP is present in 2 forms - 28 and 22 kDa. Internalized HBP markedly reduced growth factor deprivation-induced caspase-3 activation and protected endothelial cells from apoptosis, suggesting that uptake and intracellular routing of exogenous HBP to mitochondria contributes to the sustained viability of endothelial cells in the context of locally activated neutrophils.
	V	Nephritogenic lambda light chain dimer: a unique human miniautoantibody against complement factor H. A unique monoclonal Ig lambda light chain dimer (protein LOI) was isolated from the serum and urine of a patient with hypocomplementemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In vitro the lambda light chain dimer efficiently activated the alternative pathway of complement (AP). When added to normal human serum, LOI temporarily enhanced AP hemolytic activity, but during a prolonged incubation the hemolytic activity was depleted. Protein LOI was found to bind to factor H, the main regulator molecule of AP. By binding to the short consensus repeat domain 3 of factor H, the dimer LOI blocked one of three interaction sites between H and C3b and thus inhibited the activity of H and induced an uncontrolled activation of the AP. Structural analysis showed that LOI belonged to the Vlambda3a subgroup of lambda light chains. The variable (V) region of LOI was most closely related to the predicted product of the Vlambda3 germline gene Iglv3s2, although it contained several unique residues that in a tertiary homology model structure form an unusual ring of charged residues around a hydrophobic groove in the putative Ag binding site. This site fitted considerably well with a putative binding site in the molecular model of domain 3 of factor H containing a reciprocal ring of charged amino acids around a hydrophobic area. Apparently, functional blocking of factor H by the Ab fragment-like lambda light chain dimer had initiated the development of a severe form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Thus, the lambda light chain dimer LOI represents the first described pathogenic miniautoantibody in human disease.
small cell lung carcino	SCLC	Identification of genes (SPON2 and C20orf2) differentially expressed between cancerous and noncancerous lung cells by mRNA differential display. mRNA differential display was applied to three small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines, six non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines, and three normal lung tissues to identify genes differentially expressed between lung carcinoma cells and normal lung tissues and between SCLC cells and NSCLC cells. We isolated five differentially expressed genes, two that were novel and three that were already known. DIL-1 (differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells; HGMW-approved symbol SPON2) and pulmonary surfactant apoprotein A were expressed in normal lung tissues but not in lung carcinoma cell lines, whereas DIL-2 (HGMW-approved symbol C20orf2) and nm23-H1 were expressed in lung carcinoma cell lines but not in normal lung tissues. The remaining gene, Annexin II, was expressed at a lower level in SCLC than in NSCLC and normal lung tissues. These genes were also differentially expressed in primary lung cancers. One of the two novel genes, DIL-1, encodes a secreted protein homologous to the Mindin/F-spondin family. The other, DIL-2, encodes a protein with a putative ATP/GTP binding site motif. These data provide basic information necessary to understand the differences in gene expression profiles between lung carcinoma and normal lung and between SCLC and NSCLC. Further characterization of these genes will help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of human lung carcinogenesis.

t - cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis	TIAM2	Cloning and characterization of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2 (TIAM2), a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor related to TIAM1. TIAM1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that was identified in a screen for genes that increase the invasiveness of T lymphoma cell lines (Habets et al., 1994, Cell 77(4): 537-549). We have identified a gene, T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2 (HGMW-approved symbol TIAM2), with significant identity to the carboxyl-terminal region of the TIAM1 and mapped it to 6q25. TIAM2 is expressed as an approximately 3.3-kb transcript in cerebrum and as an approximately 4.4-kb transcript in the cerebellum and testis. The approximately 4. 4-kb message encodes a longer form of the approximately 3.3-kb mRNA predicted protein, and both contain homology to the Dbl-homologous region (70%) and Pleckstrin-homologous (54%) regions of TIAM1. We have purified TIAM2 and shown it to have GDP-GTP exchange activity. In situ hybridizations demonstrate TIAM2 expression in the E13.5 telencephalon of mouse embryos and in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and ependyma of adult mouse brains.
sine ocu	so	Genomic cloning and characterization of the human homeobox gene SIX6 reveals a cluster of SIX genes in chromosome 14 and associates SIX6 hemizygosity with bilateral anophthalmia and pituitary anomalies. The Drosophila gene sine oculis (so), a nuclear homeoprotein that is required for eye development, has several homologues in vertebrates (the SIX gene family). Among them, SIX3 is considered to be the functional orthologue of so because it is strongly expressed in the developing eye. However, embryonic SIX3 expression is not limited to the eye field, and SIX3 has been found to be mutated in some patients with holoprosencephaly type 2 (HPE2), suggesting that SIX3 has wide implications in head development. We report here the cloning and characterization of SIX6, a novel human SIX gene that is the homologue of the chick Six6(Optx2) gene. SIX6 is closely related to SIX3 and is expressed in the developing and adult human retina. Data from chick and mouse suggest that the human SIX6 gene is also expressed in the hypothalamic and the pituitary regions. SIX6 spans 2567 bp of genomic DNA and is split in two exons that are transcribed into a 1393-nucleotide-long mRNA. Chromosomal mapping of SIX6 revealed that it is closely linked to SIX1 and SIX4 in human chromosome 14q22.3-q23, which provides clues about the origin and evolution of the vertebrate SIX family. Recently three independent reports have associated interstitial deletions at 14q22.3-q23 with bilateral anophthalmia and pituitary anomalies. Genomic analyses of one of these cases demonstrated SIX6 hemizygosity, strongly suggesting that SIX6 haploinsufficiency is responsible for these developmental disorders.

serine proteinase	serpin	Cloning and characterization of hurpin (protease inhibitor 13): A new skin-specific, UV-repressible serine proteinase inhibitor of the ovalbumin serpin family. Epidermal keratinocytes are the primary target of the midrange ultraviolet part (UVB, 280-320 nm) of terrestrial sunlight. Analysis of the resulting UV response at the transcriptional level by differential display PCR identified a formerly unrecognized large group of repressed genes. Among those UV-repressible genes, a novel serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) termed hurpin (HaCaT UV-repressible serpin) has been identified. The isolated full-length cDNAs harbour a 1176 bp open reading frame encoding a potential protein with 391 amino acid residues and a predicted molecular mass of approximately 44 kDa. The novel serpin has nearly 59 % amino acid identity with the squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 (SCCA2). In addition, it displays all of the structural features unique to the ovalbumin family of serpins (ov-serpins). The amino acid sequence of the hinge region in the reactive site loop suggests that hurpin has the potential for protease inhibition. The putative reactive center P1-P1'residues were identified as Thr356-Ser357 by alignment with other ov-serpins. The physiological target protease is unknown and the in vitro translated hurpin does not form SDS-stable complexes with a variety of known serine proteases. Expression of hurpin is restricted to epidermal cells where two distinct transcripts of 3.0 and 3.4 kb are detectable. Furthermore, expression of hurpin appears to be related to the activation or proliferation state of keratinocytes, since hurpin transcripts are more abundant in immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and in cultured normal human keratinocytes, compared to the expression in normal skin. Moreover, in psoriasis, a skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and responsive to therapeutic UV irradiation, overexpression of hurpin is noted in psoriatic skin lesions compared to non-lesional skin.
lipopolysaccha	LPS	IL1HY1: A novel interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene. Interleukin-1 is a potent mediator of inflammation, involved in regulating a wide variety of physiological and cellular events. We have identified and characterized a novel member of the human interleukin-1 gene family (IL1HY1). The encoded protein demonstrates significant amino acid homology to the receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) at 52%. The gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2, in close proximity to the IL-1 locus. IL1HY1 message is tightly regulated being most predominantly expressed in the skin, but also detected in the spleen, brain leukocyte, and macrophage cell types. Furthermore, the message can be induced in THP-1 cells by phorbol ester (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment.
epidermal growth	EGF	Genomic organization and structure of the 3' region of human MUC3: alternative splicing predicts membrane-bound and soluble forms of the mucin. The MUC3 gene encodes a large, glycosylated mucin produced by intestinal epithelial cells to form a protective barrier against the external environment. Recently published cDNA sequences for the carboxyl-terminal region of MUC3 polypeptide indicated that rodent Muc3 possesses two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, whereas the sequence of human MUC3 predicted termination after the first EGF-like domain. Here we describe the complete genomic sequence encompassing the carboxyl terminal region of human MUC3, revealing the boundaries of 11 exons. RT-PCR and cDNA library cloning experiments indicate that the gene is alternatively spliced, yielding a major membrane-bound form as well as multiple soluble forms. Thus, this work indicates that both membrane-bound and soluble MUC3 mucin proteins are produced by alternative splicing of a single gene. A potentially important polymorphism involving a Tyr residue with a proposed role in signalling is described as well.
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney	ADPKD	Polycystin-L is a calcium-regulated cation channel permeable to calcium ions. Polycystic kidney diseases are genetic disorders in which the renal parenchyma is progressively replaced by fluid-filled cysts. Two members of the polycystin family (polycystin-1 and -2) are mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and polycystin-L is deleted in mice with renal and retinal defects. Polycystins are membrane proteins that share significant sequence homology, especially polycystin-2 and -L (50% identity and 71% similarity). The functions of the polycystins remain unknown. Here we show that polycystin-L is a calcium-modulated nonselective cation channel that is permeable to sodium, potassium and calcium ions. Patch-clamp experiments revealed single-channel activity with a unitary conductance of 137 pS. Channel activity was substantially increased when either the extracellular or intracellular calcium-ion concentration was raised, indicating that polycystin-L may act as a transducer of calcium-mediated signalling in vivo. Its large single-channel conductance and regulation by calcium ions distinguish it from other structurally related cation channels.
ton	TDU	TONDU (TDU), a novel human protein related to the product of vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila melanogaster interacts with vertebrate TEF factors and substitutes for Vg function in wing formation. The mammalian TEF and the Drosophila scalloped genes belong to a conserved family of transcriptional factors that possesses a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. Transcriptional activation by these proteins likely requires interactions with specific coactivators. In Drosophila, Scalloped (Sd) interacts with Vestigial (Vg) to form a complex, which binds DNA through the Sd TEA/ATTS domain. The Sd-Vg heterodimer is a key regulator of wing development, which directly controls several target genes and is able to induce wing outgrowth when ectopically expressed. Here we show that Vg contains two distinct transcriptional activation domains, suggesting that the function of Vg is to mediate transcriptional activation by Sd. By expressing a chimeric GAL4-Sd protein in Drosophila, we found that the transcriptional activity of the Vg-Sd heterodimer is negatively regulated at the AP and DV boundary of the wing disc. We also identify a novel human protein, TONDU, which contains a short domain homologous to the domain of Vg required for interaction with Sd. We show that TONDU specifically interacts with a domain conserved in all the mammalian TEF factors. Expression of TDU in Drosophila by means of the UAS-GAL4 system shows that this human protein can substitute for Vg in wing formation. We propose that TDU is a specific coactivator for the mammalian TEFs.

protein tyrosine kinase	PTKs	Molecular cloning of a docking protein, BRDG1, that acts downstream of the Tec tyrosine kinase. Tec, Btk, Itk, Bmx, and Txk constitute the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), a family with the distinct feature of containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Tec acts in signaling pathways triggered by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), cytokine receptors, integrins, and receptor-type PTKs. Although upstream regulators of Tec family kinases are relatively well characterized, little is known of the downstream effectors of these enzymes. The yeast two-hybrid system has identified several proteins that interact with the kinase domain of Tec, one of which is now revealed to be a previously unknown docking protein termed BRDG1 (BCR downstream signaling 1). BRDG1 contains a proline-rich motif, a PH domain, and multiple tyrosine residues that are potential target sites for Src homology 2 domains. In 293 cells expressing recombinant BRDG1 and various PTKs, Tec and Pyk2, but not Btk, Bmx, Lyn, Syk, or c-Abl, induced marked phosphorylation of BRDG1 on tyrosine residues. BRDG1 was also phosphorylated by Tec directly in vitro. Efficient phosphorylation of BRDG1 by Tec required the PH and SH2 domains as well as the kinase domain of the latter. Furthermore, BRDG1 was shown to participate in a positive feedback loop by increasing the activity of Tec. BRDG1 transcripts are abundant in the human B cell line Ramos, and the endogenous protein underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to BCR stimulation. BRDG1 thus appears to function as a docking protein acting downstream of Tec in BCR signaling.

transmemb	TM	Mutations in NPC1 highlight a conserved NPC1-specific cysteine-rich domain. Niemann-Pick type II disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a defect in intracellular trafficking of sterols. We have determined the intron/exon boundaries of eight exons from the conserved 3' portion of NPC1, the gene associated with most cases of the disease. SSCP analyses were designed for these exons and were used to identify the majority of mutations in 13 apparently unrelated families. Thirteen mutations were found, accounting for 19 of the 26 alleles. These mutations included eight different missense mutations (including one reported by Greer et al. [1998]), one 4-bp and two 2-bp deletions that generate premature stop codons, and two intronic mutations that are predicted to alter splicing. Two of the missense mutations were present in predicted transmembrane (TM) domains. Clustering of these and other reported NPC1 mutations in the carboxy-terminal third of the protein indicates that screening of these exons, by means of the SSCP analyses reported here, will detect most mutations. The carboxy-terminal half of the Npc1 protein shares amino acid similarity with the TM domains of the morphogen receptor Patched, with the largest stretch of unrelated sequence lying between two putative TM spans. Alignment of this portion of the human Npc1 protein sequence with Npc1-related sequences from mouse, yeast, nematode, and a plant, Arabidopsis, revealed conserved cysteine residues that may coordinate the structure of this domain. That 7 of a total of 13 NPC1 missense mutations are concentrated in this single Npc1-specific domain suggests that integrity of this region is particularly critical for normal functioning of the protein.
germinal center kinase	GCKs	TNIK, a novel member of the germinal center kinase family that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and regulates the cytoskeleton. Germinal center kinases (GCKs) compose a subgroup of the Ste20 family of kinases. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel GCK family kinase, Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) that interacts with both Traf2 and Nck. TNIK encodes a polypeptide of 1360 amino acids with eight spliced isoforms. It has 90% amino acid identity to the Nck-interacting kinase in both the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal germinal center kinase homology region. The homology drops to 53% in the intermediate region. TNIK specifically activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway when transfected into Phoenix-A cells (derivatives of 293 cells), similar to many GCKs. However, in contrast to other GCKs, this activation is mediated solely by the GCK homology region of TNIK. In addition, in Phoenix-A, NIH-3T3, and Hela cells, overexpression of wild type TNIK, but not the kinase mutant form of TNIK, results in the disruption of F-actin structure and the inhibition of cell spreading. Furthermore, TNIK can phosphorylate Gelsolin in vitro. This is the first time that a GCK family kinase is shown to be potentially involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton.

However, in contrast to other GCKs, this activation is mediated solely by the GCK homology region of TNIK. In addition, in Phoenix-A, NIH-3T3, and Hela cells, overexpression of wild type TNIK, but not the kinase mutant form of TNIK, results in the disruption of F-actin structure and the inhibition of cell spreading. Furthermore, TNIK can phosphorylate Gelsolin in vitro. This is the first time that a GCK family kinase is shown to be potentially involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton.
mouse mast cell protea	mMCP	Identification of a new member of the tryptase family of mouse and human mast cell proteases which possesses a novel COOH-terminal hydrophobic extension. Mapping of the tryptase locus on chromosome 17 revealed a novel gene 2.3 kilobase 3' of the mouse mast cell protease (mMCP) 6 gene. This 3.7-kilobase gene encodes the first example of a protease in the tryptase family that contains a membrane-spanning segment located at its COOH terminus. Comparative structural studies indicated that the putative transmembrane tryptase (TMT) possesses a unique substrate-binding cleft. As assessed by RNA blot analyses, mTMT is expressed in mice in both strain- and tissue-dependent manners. Thus, different transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms are used to control the expression of mTMT in vivo. Analysis of the corresponding tryptase locus in the human genome resulted in the isolation and characterization of the hTMT gene. The hTMT transcript is expressed in numerous tissues and is also translated. Analysis of the tryptase family of genes in mice and humans now indicates that a primordial serine protease gene duplicated early and often during the evolution of mammals to generate a panel of homologous tryptases in each species that differ in their tissue expression, substrate specificities, and physical properties.

human homologue of drosophila ariad	HHARI	The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH7 and UbcH8 interact with RING finger/IBR motif-containing domains of HHARI and H7-AP1. Ubiquitinylation of proteins appears to be mediated by the specific interplay between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). However, cognate E3s and/or substrate proteins have been identified for only a few E2s. To identify proteins that can interact with the human E2 UbcH7, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Two proteins were identified and termed human homologue of Drosophila ariadne (HHARI) and UbcH7-associated protein (H7-AP1). Both proteins, which are widely expressed, are characterized by the presence of RING finger and in between RING fingers (IBR) domains. No other overt structural similarity was observed between the two proteins. In vitro binding studies revealed that an N-terminal RING finger motif (HHARI) and the IBR domain (HHARI and H7-AP1) are involved in the interaction of these proteins with UbcH7. Furthermore, binding of these two proteins to UbcH7 is specific insofar that both HHARI and H7-AP1 can bind to the closely related E2, UbcH8, but not to the unrelated E2s UbcH5 and UbcH1. Although it is not clear at present whether HHARI and H7-AP1 serve, for instance, as substrates for UbcH7 or represent proteins with E3 activity, our data suggests that a subset of RING finger/IBR proteins are functionally linked to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.

murine intracisternal a -	IAPs	Characterization of a mammalian gene related to the yeast CCR4 general transcription factor and revealed by transposon insertion. Murine intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) are reiterated retrovirus-like transposable elements that can act as insertional mutagens. Accordingly, we previously identified a chimeric transcript initiated at an IAP promoter and extending through a 3'-located open reading frame with significant similarity to the C-terminal domain of the yeast CCR4 general transcription factor. In this report, we characterize the corresponding murine gene, mCCR4, and its human homologue, thus providing the first description of CCR4-like factors in mammals. cDNA cloning revealed two mCCR4 mRNAs of 2.7 and 3.1 kilobases, differing by their transcription start sites within the native mCCR4 gene promoter, and encoding a putative 430-amino acid protein. The mCCR4 gene contains three exons and two introns spanning almost 27 kilobases. The IAP insertion, detected only in some laboratory mouse strains, is recent and lies within the first intron. The 5'-region of the gene has features of housekeeping gene promoters. It lacks a TATA box but contains a CpG island and Sp1 sites. This region discloses strong promoter activity in transient transfection assays and also stimulates transcription in the reverse orientation, a feature common to other CpG island-containing promoters. Transcripts were detected in all the organs tested, although at a variable level, and displayed no strain-dependent differences relative to the IAP insertion, suggesting the existence of mechanisms preserving mCCR4 transcription from the usually deleterious effects of intronic transposition. The strong amino acid conservation between the human, murine, and the previously identified Xenopus CCR4-like proteins, is consistent with an important and conserved role for this protein in vertebrates.
human emap - related protein -	HuEMAP-2	Sequence and expression patterns of a human EMAP-related protein-2 (HuEMAP-2). Until recently, the microtubule-associated protein, EMAP, was identified only in echinoderms such as sea urchin, starfish and sand dollar. Sea urchin EMAP localizes to the mitotic apparatus in vivo and modifies the assembly dynamics of microtubules in vitro. To identify domains important for EMAP function, we cloned and sequenced cDNAs for an EMAP-related protein in human. The nucleotide sequence of a human EMAP-related protein-2 (HuEMAP-2) encodes a protein of 649 amino acids in length. The translated polypeptide sequence and domain structure of sea urchin EMAP and HuEMAP-2 are highly conserved, with greater than 57% identity and 77% similarity at the translated amino acid level. Southern blot analysis is consistent with the presence of a single HuEMAP-2 gene in the human genome. Moreover, HuEMAP-2 is a member of a larger protein family with at least four HuEMAP sequences in the NCBI databases. One of these, HuEMAP-1, is identified as the candidate gene for the Usher syndrome 1 a locus (Genomics 43:104-106, 1997). Northern blot analysis indicates that HuEMAP-1, and HuEMAP-2 are expressed in different human tissues. In addition, these RNA blots indicate that HuEMAP-2 transcripts may be differentially spliced in neuronal tissues.

b - cell - specific activator	BSAP	Commitment to the B-lymphoid lineage depends on the transcription factor Pax5. The Pax5 gene encoding the B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP) is expressed within the haematopoietic system exclusively in the B-lymphoid lineage, where it is required in vivo for progression beyond the pro-B-cell stage. However, Pax5 is not essential for in vitro propagation of pro-B cells in the presence of interleukin-7 and stromal cells. Here we show that pro-B cells lacking Pax5 are also incapable of in vitro B-cell differentiation unless Pax5 expression is restored by retroviral transduction. Pax5-/- pro-B cells are not restricted in their lineage fate, as stimulation with appropriate cytokines induces them to differentiate into functional macrophages, osteoclasts, dendritic cells, granulocytes and natural killer cells. As expected for a clonogenic haematopoietic progenitor with lymphomyeloid developmental potential, the Pax5-/- pro-B cell expresses genes of different lineage-affiliated programmes, and restoration of Pax5 activity represses this lineage-promiscuous transcription. Pax5 therefore plays an essential role in B-lineage commitment by suppressing alternative lineage choices.
bromodomain protein of 75 k	BP75	Identification and molecular characterization of BP75, a novel bromodomain-containing protein. We here describe the identification and characterization of a novel bromodomain-containing protein, the bromodomain protein of 75 kDa (BP75). Initially, we identified BP75 in a two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with the first PDZ (acronym for post-synaptic density protein PSD-95, Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor DlgA and the tight junction protein ZO-1) domain in protein tyrosine phosphatase-BAS-like (PTP-BL). We found that BP75 is expressed ubiquitously and show that both BP75 and a PTP-BL deletion mutant consisting of the first PDZ domain are located mainly in the nucleus, although cytoplasmic localization is also evident. Full-length PTP-BL, on the contrary, is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although some basal nuclear staining is observed. The described molecular interaction may reflect a mechanism of coupling submembraneous signalling events and nuclear events.

cortical thymic epithelial	cTEC	Cloning of a novel MHC-encoded serine peptidase highly expressed by cortical epithelial cells of the thymus. Antigen presentation by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) during the positive selection of T cells has been shown to differ from that of other antigen-presenting cells. In the case of MHC class II presentation, cathepsin L as opposed to cathepsin S is responsible at least in part for the degradation of invariant chain. Other proteases, however, must be involved. We have identified a putative serine protease that is specifically expressed in the thymus. Encoded within the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, this gene has sequence homology with lysosomal prolylcarboxypeptidase, suggesting that it is a serine protease. We have, therefore, designated this gene thymus-specific serine protease (TSSP). In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence staining reveal that TSSP is expressed exclusively by cortical thymic epithelial cells, with the strongest staining noted around vessels and the thymic capsule. The identification of TSSP further supports the theory that MHC class II antigen processing and presentation in the thymic cortex involves a proteolytic milieu that differs from that of other antigen-presenting cells.

baculovirus iap	BIR	A human IAP-family gene, apollon, expressed in human brain cancer cells. IAP is a family of protein that has baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains and inhibits apoptosis. We found a human IAP family gene, which we named Apollon, encoding a huge protein (530 kDa) that contains a single BIR domain and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme domain, that is a human homolog of BRUCE. Apollon protein was expressed in four of six brain cancers (gliomas), and one of five ovarian cancers in 38 human cancer cell lines that we examined. Among the brain cancer cell lines, SNB-78 expressed a high level of Apollon, and this cell line shows resistance against various anticancer drugs. Treating SNB-78 cells with antisense oligonucleotide against Apollon reduced the expression of Apollon protein, and significantly sensitized the cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin and camptothecin. These results suggest that Apollon protects SNB-78 cells from undergoing apoptosis and, at least in part, plays a role in tumorigenesis and drug resistance of this cell line.
human 17beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type	17beta-HSD 7	Determination of cDNA, gene structure and chromosomal localization of the novel human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7(1). We have identified human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (17beta-HSD 7). The novel human cDNA encodes a 37 kDa protein that shows 78 and 74% amino acid identity with rat and mouse 17beta-HSD 7, respectively. These enzymes are responsible for estradiol production in the corpus luteum during pregnancy, but are also present in placenta and several steroid target tissues (breast, testis and prostate) as revealed by RT-PCR. The human 17beta-HSD 7 gene (HSD17B7) consists of nine exons and eight introns, spanning 21. 8 kb and maps to chromosome 10p11.2 close to susceptibility loci for tumor progression, obesity and diabetes. The HSD17B7 promoter (1.2 kb) reveals binding sites for brain-specific and lymphoid transcription factors corresponding to additional expression domains in hematopoietic tissues and the developing brain as identified by in silico Northern blot.
hereditary multiple exost	HME	A direct interaction between EXT proteins and glycosyltransferases is defective in hereditary multiple exostoses. Hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) is an autosomal dominant condition in which bony outgrowths occur from the juxtaepiphyseal regions of the long bones. In a few percent of cases these exostoses undergo malignant transformation to chondrosarcomas. HME results from mutations in one of two homologous genes, EXT1 and EXT2. These are members of a new gene family that is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to higher vertebrates. In humans this family comprises five genes which are most conserved at their C-termini, but they do not contain any discernible functional motifs and their function(s) is unclear. Indirect evidence suggests that EXT proteins are involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis, act as tumor suppressors and affect hedgehog signaling. One recent study has also reported that these proteins co-purify with glycosyltransferase (GlcA and GlcNAc transferase) activity and on that basis it has been postulated that they are themselves glycosyl-transferases. We performed two-hybrid screens with a fragment of EXT2 from the region that is most highly conserved in the gene family and identified two interacting proteins: the tumor necrosis factor type 1 associated protein and a novel UDP-GalNAc:poly-peptide N -acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. Significantly, both these interactions were abrogated by a disease-causing EXT mutation, indicating that they are important in the etiology of HME. The EXT2-GalNAc-T5 interaction provides the first direct physical link between EXT proteins and known components of glycosamino-glycan synthesis.
camptodactyly - arthropathy - coxa vara - pericarditis	CACP	CACP, encoding a secreted proteoglycan, is mutated in camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome. Altered growth and function of synoviocytes, the intimal cells which line joint cavities and tendon sheaths, occur in a number of skeletal diseases. Hyperplasia of synoviocytes is found in both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, despite differences in the underlying aetiologies of the two disorders. We have studied the autosomal recessive disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP; MIM 208250) to identify biological pathways that lead to synoviocyte hyperplasia, the principal pathological feature of this syndrome. Using a positional-candidate approach, we identified mutations in a gene (CACP) encoding a secreted proteoglycan as the cause of CACP. The CACP protein, which has previously been identified as both 'megakaryocyte stimulating factor precursor' and 'superficial zone protein', contains domains that have homology to somatomedin B, heparin-binding proteins, mucins and haemopexins. In addition to expression in joint synovium and cartilage, CACP is expressed in non-skeletal tissues including liver and pericardium. The similarity of CACP sequence to that of other protein families and the expression of CACP in non-skeletal tissues suggest it may have diverse biological activities.
cytochrome c oxida	COX	Fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy with COX deficiency and mutations in SCO2, a COX assembly gene. Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyses the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes three COX subunits (I-III) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encodes ten. In addition, ancillary proteins are required for the correct assembly and function of COX (refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Although pathogenic mutations in mtDNA-encoded COX subunits have been described, no mutations in the nDNA-encoded subunits have been uncovered in any mendelian-inherited COX deficiency disorder. In yeast, two related COX assembly genes, SCO1 and SCO2 (for synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase), enable subunits I and II to be incorporated into the holoprotein. Here we have identified mutations in the human homologue, SCO2, in three unrelated infants with a newly recognized fatal cardioencephalomyopathy and COX deficiency. Immunohistochemical studies implied that the enzymatic deficiency, which was most severe in cardiac and skeletal muscle, was due to the loss of mtDNA-encoded COX subunits. The clinical phenotype caused by mutations in human SCO2 differs from that caused by mutations in SURF1, the only other known COX assembly gene associated with a human disease, Leigh syndrome.

inosine monophos	IMP	Human phosphoribosylformylglycineamide amidotransferase (FGARAT): regional mapping, complete coding sequence, isolation of a functional genomic clone, and DNA sequence analysis. Purines play essential roles in many cellular functions, including DNA replication, transcription, intra- and extra-cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and as coenzymes for many biochemical reactions. The de-novo synthesis of purines requires 10 enzymatic steps for the production of inosine monophosphate (IMP). Defects in purine metabolism are associated with human diseases. Further, many anticancer agents function as inhibitors of the de-novo biosynthetic pathway. Genes or cDNAs for most of the enzymes comprising this pathway have been isolated from humans or other mammals. One notable exception is the phosphoribosylformylglycineamide amidotransferase (FGARAT) gene, which encodes the fourth step of this pathway. This gene has been cloned from numerous microorganisms and from Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans. We report here the identification of a human cDNA containing the coding region of the FGARAT mRNA and the isolation of a P1 clone that contains an intact human FGARAT gene. The P1 clone corrects the purine auxotrophy and protein deficiency of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants (AdeB) deficient in both the activity and the protein for FGARAT. The P1 clone was used to regionally map the FGARAT gene to chromosome region 17p13, a location consistent with our prior assignment of this gene to chromosome 17. A comparison of the DNA sequence of the human FGARAT and FGARAT DNA sequence from 17 other organisms is reported. The isolation of this gene means that DNA clones for all the 10 steps of IMP synthesis have been isolated from humans or other mammals.

anchorage - independent	AIG	Changes in levels of normal ML-1 gene transcripts associated with the conversion of human nontumorigenic to tumorigenic phenotypes. Evaluation of malignant human tumors in a xenobiotic nude mouse system has demonstrated that not all cells in tumors exhibit the capacity to form progressively growing tumors. However, nontumorigenic cells isolated from human tumors can be converted to a tumorigenic phenotype in nude mice by treatment with chemical carcinogens or by transfection with antisense to tumor suppressor genes. A newly discovered gene, designated ML-1, appears to be associated with tumorigenesis, because an ML-1 antisense cDNA construct, transfected into nontumorigenic, anchorage-independent growth (AIG) cells, was sufficient to convert these cells into a tumorigenic phenotype. The AIG cells transfected with ML-1 antisense cDNA constructs and converted to tumorigenic cells did not exhibit expression of normal ML-1 mRNA transcripts in the converted cells when evaluated by Northern analysis, whereas premalignant and normal cells expressed ML-1 transcripts at a high level. The converted cells exhibited a loss of growth control and produced tumors in a surrogate nude mouse that were greater than 2.0 cm in less than 2 months. The ML-1 gene has a DNA sequence that is 2177 bp in size and is located on chromosome number 13 on the q arm at site 12-14. Sequence analysis and investigation of GenBank sequences indicate that this is a newly described human gene.
psd - 95 / dlg / zo -	PDZ	Identification of a novel PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like protein interacting with the C terminus of presenilin-1. Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is the most causative Alzheimer gene product, and its function is not well understood. In an attempt to elucidate the function of PS-1, we screened a human brain cDNA library for PS-1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated a novel protein containing a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain. This novel PS-1-associated protein (PSAP) shares a significant similarity with a Caenorhabditis elegans protein of unknown function. Northern blot analysis revealed that PSAP is predominantly expressed in the brain. Deletion of the first four C-terminal amino acid residues of PS-1, which contain the PDZ domain-binding motif (Gln-Phe-Tyr-Ile), reduced the binding activity of PS-1 toward PSAP 4-fold. These data suggest that PS-1 may associate with a PDZ-like domain-containing protein in vivo and thus may participate in receptor or channel clustering and intracellular signaling events in the brain.

Deletion of the first four C-terminal amino acid residues of PS-1, which contain the PDZ domain-binding motif (Gln-Phe-Tyr-Ile), reduced the binding activity of PS-1 toward PSAP 4-fold. These data suggest that PS-1 may associate with a PDZ-like domain-containing protein in vivo and thus may participate in receptor or channel clustering and intracellular signaling events in the brain.
ps - 1 - associated	PSAP	Identification of a novel PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like protein interacting with the C terminus of presenilin-1. Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is the most causative Alzheimer gene product, and its function is not well understood. In an attempt to elucidate the function of PS-1, we screened a human brain cDNA library for PS-1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated a novel protein containing a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain.

fibroblast growth factor - inducible -	Fn14	The mitogen-inducible Fn14 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein that modulates fibroblast adhesion and migration. The binding of polypeptide growth factors to their appropriate cell surface transmembrane receptors triggers numerous biochemical responses, including the transcriptional activation of specific genes. We have used a differential display approach to identify fibroblast growth factor-1-inducible genes in murine NIH 3T3 cells. Here, we report that the fibroblast growth factor-inducible-14 (Fn14) gene is a growth factor-regulated, immediate-early response gene expressed in a developmental stage- and adult tissue-specific manner in vivo. This gene, located on mouse chromosome 17, is predicted to encode an 129-amino acid type Ia membrane protein with no significant sequence similarity to any known protein. We have used two experimental approaches, direct fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation analysis of biotinylated cell surface proteins, to demonstrate that Fn14 is located on the plasma membrane. To examine the biological consequences of constitutive Fn14 expression, we isolated NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing variable levels of epitope-tagged Fn14 and analyzed their phenotypic properties in vitro. These experiments revealed that Fn14 expression decreased cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and vitronectin and also reduced serum-stimulated cell growth and migration. These results indicate that Fn14 is a novel plasma membrane-spanning molecule that may play a role in cell-matrix interactions.
creb - binding	CBP	Molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of the human CITED2 gene encoding p35srj/Mrg1. P35srj is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that binds the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). It is an alternatively spliced isoform of Mrg1, a cytokine-inducible factor that has transformation activity. P35srj interferes with the recruitment of p300/CBP by the transcription factor HIF-1alpha, a process that is essential for the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Here we report the cloning of the human gene CITED2, which encodes p35srj and Mrg1. The CITED2 gene is composed of three exons and two introns. An unusually large (3 kb) CpG island covers both the promoter and the transcribed portions of the gene. The 5'-flanking region of the gene is active as a promoter in transient transfection assays and contains multiple STAT-binding sites, in keeping with its responsiveness to different cytokines. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, and identity to a known human sequence-tagged site (D6S2114), was used to map the CITED2 gene to chromosome 6q23.3.
human ribosome protein s6	RSK	Cloning, characterization, and chromosome mapping of RPS6KC1, a novel putative member of the ribosome protein S6 kinase family, to chromosome 12q12-q13.1. A novel cDNA encoding a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase was isolated from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library. It contains an open reading frame that extends from nt 104 to 1510 and codes for a protein of 469 amino acids. A catalytic domain containing the conserved residues of the Ser/Thr protein kinase, especially human ribosome protein S6 kinase (RSK), was found to be located in the C-terminal end of the deduced protein. The gene was mapped to human chromosome 12q12-q13.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and this result was confirmed with the Radiation Hybrid GB4 panel. Northern hybridization showed that the novel gene is expressed in all 16 human tissues tested with especially strong expression in testis, skeletal muscle, and brain, whereas weak expression was detected in kidney, thymus, small intestine, liver, lung, heart, and colon.
x - linked lymphoproliferative	XLP	Epstein-Barr virus-negative boys with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are mutated in the SH2D1A gene, as are patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a primary immunodeficiency, which most often manifests itself after Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The main clinical phenotypes include fulminant or fatal infectious mononucleosis, dysgammaglobulinaemia and malignant lymphoma. We have recently cloned the SH2D1A gene, which has been shown to be mutated in approximately 70% of XLP patients. Now we report five novel SH2D1A mutations in patients from five unrelated XLP families. No mutations were found in another three XLP families. In three boys with early onset non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from two unrelated families a deletion of SH2D1A exon 1 and a splice site mutation were found, respectively. These patients did not show any laboratory or clinical signs of a previous EBV infection. A fourth EBV-uninfected and unrelated boy with a stop mutation in the SH2D1A gene shows only signs of dysgammaglobulinaemia. Development of dysgamma-globulinaemia and lymphoma without evidence of prior EBV infection in four of our patients suggests that EBV is unrelated to these phenotypes, in contrast to fulminant or fatal infectious mononucleosis. The role of SH2D1A as a putative tumour suppressor gene remains to be investigated.

dyskeratosis congeni	DKC	Dyskerin localizes to the nucleolus and its mislocalization is unlikely to play a role in the pathogenesis of dyskeratosis congenita. Mutations in the DKC1 gene are responsible for causing the bone marrow failure syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita (DKC; OMIM 305000). The majority of mutations identified to date are missense mutations and are clustered in exons 3, 4 and 11. It is predicted that the corresponding protein dyskerin is a nucleolar phosphoprotein which functions in both pseudo-uridylation and cleavage of precursor rRNA. Dyskerin contains multiple putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) at the N-terminus (KKHKKKKERKS) and C-terminus [KRKR(X)(17)KKEKKKSKKDKKAK(X)(17)-KKKKKKKKAKEVELVSE]. By fusing dyskerin with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and by following a time course of expression in mammalian cell lines, we showed that full-length dyskerin initially localizes to the nucleoplasm and subsequently accumulates in the nucleoli. A co-localization to the coiled bodies was observed in some cells where dyskerin-EGFP had translocated to the nucleoli. Analysis of a series of mutant constructs indicated that whereas the most C-terminal lysine-rich clusters [KKEKKKS-KKDKKAK(X)(17)KKKKKKKKAKEVELVSE] influence the rate of nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation, the KRKR sequence is primarily responsible for the nuclear import. Nucleolar localization was maintained when either the N- or C-terminal motifs were mutated, but not when all NLSs were removed. We conclude that the intranuclear localization of dyskerin is accomplished by the synergistic effect of a number of NLSs and that the nucleolar localization signals are contained within the NLSs. Further, examination of dyskerin-EGFP fusions mimicking mutations detected in patients indicated that the intracellular mislocalization of dyskerin is unlikely to cause DKC.

nuclear fmrp interacting	NUFIP	A novel RNA-binding nuclear protein that interacts with the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) protein. Silenced expression of the FMR1 gene is responsible for the fragile X syndrome. The FMR1 gene codes for an RNA binding protein (FMRP), which can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is found associated to polysomes in the cytoplasm. By two-hybrid assay in yeast, we identified a novel protein interacting with FMRP: nuclear FMRP interacting protein (NUFIP). NUFIP mRNA expression is strikingly similar to that of the FMR1 gene in neurones of cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. At the subcellular level, NUFIP colocalizes with nuclear isoforms of FMRP in a dot-like pattern. NUFIP presents a C2H2 zinc finger motif and a nuclear localization signal, but has no homology to known proteins and shows RNA binding activity in vitro. NUFIP does not interact with the FMRP homologues encoded by the FXR1 and FXR2 genes. Thus, these results indicate a specific nuclear role for FMRP.
phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - ace	PMA	Cloning and functional characterization of the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters hSVCT1 and hSVCT2. Two sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters, hSVCT1 and hSVCT2, were cloned from a human kidney cDNA library. hSVCT1 had a 1797 bp open reading frame encoding a 598 amino acid polypeptide. The 1953 bp open reading frame of hSVCT2 encoded a 650 amino acid polypeptide. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, both transporters were functionally expressed. By Eadie-Hofstee transformation the apparent K(m) of hSVCT1 for ascorbate was 252.0 microM and of hSVCT2 for ascorbate was 21.3 microM. Both transporters were sodium-dependent and did not transport dehydroascorbic acid. Incubation of oocytes expressing either transporter with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited ascorbate transport activity. Availability of the human transporter clones may facilitate new strategies for determining vitamin C intake.
neuropeptide	NPY	Role of the Y5 neuropeptide Y receptor in limbic seizures. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an inhibitory neuromodulator expressed abundantly in the central nervous system that is suspected of being an endogenous antiepileptic agent that can control propagation of limbic seizures. Electrophysiological and pharmacological data suggest that these actions of NPY are mediated by G protein-coupled NPY Y2 and NPY Y5 receptors. To determine whether the NPY Y5 receptor (Y5R) is required for normal control of limbic seizures, we examined hippocampal function and responsiveness to kainic acid-induced seizures in Y5R-deficient (Y5R-/-) mice. We report that Y5R-/- mice do not exhibit spontaneous seizure-like activity; however, they are more sensitive to kainic acid-induced seizures. Electrophysiological examination of hippocampal slices from mutant mice revealed normal function, but the antiepileptic effects of exogenously applied NPY were absent. These data demonstrate that Y5R has an important role in mediating NPY's inhibitory actions in the mouse hippocampus and suggest a role for Y5R in the control of limbic seizures.

unfolded protein	UPR	Mammalian transcription factor ATF6 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein and activated by proteolysis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) controls the levels of molecular chaperones and enzymes involved in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We recently isolated ATF6 as a candidate for mammalian UPR-specific transcription factor. We report here that ATF6 constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6) is directly converted to a 50-kDa protein (p50ATF6) in ER-stressed cells. Furthermore, we showed that the most important consequence of this conversion was altered subcellular localization; p90ATF6 is embedded in the ER, whereas p50ATF6 is a nuclear protein. p90ATF6 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a hydrophobic stretch in the middle of the molecule. Thus, the N-terminal half containing a basic leucine zipper motif is oriented facing the cytoplasm. Full-length ATF6 as well as its C-terminal deletion mutant carrying the transmembrane domain is localized in the ER when transfected. In contrast, mutant ATF6 representing the cytoplasmic region translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of the endogenous GRP78/BiP gene. We propose that ER stress-induced proteolysis of membrane-bound p90ATF6 releases soluble p50ATF6, leading to induced transcription in the nucleus. Unlike yeast UPR, mammalian UPR appears to use a system similar to that reported for cholesterol homeostasis.

	Su(fu)	Characterization of the human suppressor of fused, a negative regulator of the zinc-finger transcription factor Gli. Drosophila Suppressor of fused (Su(fu)) encodes a novel 468-amino-acid cytoplasmic protein which, by genetic analysis, functions as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog segment polarity pathway. Here we describe the primary structure, tissue distribution, biochemical and functional analyses of a human Su(fu) (hSu(fu)). Two alternatively spliced isoforms of hSu(fu) were identified, predicting proteins of 433 and 484 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 48 and 54 kDa, respectively. The two proteins differ only by the inclusion or exclusion of a 52-amino-acid extension at the carboxy terminus. Both isoforms were expressed in multiple embryonic and adult tissues, and exhibited a developmental profile consistent with a role in Hedgehog signaling. The hSu(fu) contains a high-scoring PEST-domain, and exhibits an overall 37% sequence identity (63% similarity) with the Drosophila protein and 97% sequence identity with the mouse Su(fu). The hSu(fu) locus mapped to chromosome 10q24-q25, a region which is deleted in glioblastomas, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma and endometrial cancer. HSu(fu) was found to repress activity of the zinc-finger transcription factor Gli, which mediates Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, and to physically interact with Gli, Gli2 and Gli3 as well as with Slimb, an F-box containing protein which, in the fly, suppresses the Hedgehog response, in part by stimulating the degradation of the fly Gli homologue. Coexpression of Slimb with Su(fu) potentiated the Su(fu)-mediated repression of Gli. Taken together, our data provide biochemical and functional evidence for the hypothesis that Su(fu) is a key negative regulator in the vertebrate Hedgehog signaling pathway. The data further suggest that Su(fu) can act by binding to Gli and inhibiting Gli-mediated transactivation as well as by serving as an adaptor protein, which links Gli to the Slimb-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway.

homeodoma	HD	Cloning and DNA-binding properties of the rat pancreatic beta-cell-specific factor Nkx6.1. The homeodomain (HD) protein Nkx6.1 is the most beta-cell-specific transcription factor known in the pancreas and its function is critical for the formation of the insulin-producing beta-cells. However, the target genes, DNA-binding site, and transcriptional properties of Nkx6.1 are unknown. Using in vitro binding site selection we have identified the DNA sequence of the Nkx6.1 binding site to be TTAATTG/A. A reporter plasmid containing four copies of this sequence is activated by an Nkx6.1HD/VP16 fusion construct. Full-length Nkx6.1 fails to activate this reporter plasmid in spite of robust interaction with the binding site in vitro. Stable expression of Nkx6.1 in the glucagon-producing alpha-cell-like MSL-G-AN cells induces expression of the endogenous insulin gene in a subset of the cell population. The expression of other known beta-cell-specific factors such as Pax4, Pax6, Pdx1, GLUT2 and GLP1-R is unchanged by the introduction of Nkx6.1.
heat shock cognate	hsc40	Hsc40, a new member of the hsp40 family, exhibits similar expression profile to that of hsc70 in mammalian cells. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new hsp40 family member, heat shock cognate 40 (hsc40), which may be a specific functional partner for hsc70. The hsc40 gene consists of five exons and four introns. The previously characterized hsp40 gene contains only three exons and two introns. Despite this difference in the numbers of exons and introns, the structures of these two genes are actually quite similar. If the first two exons and introns of the hsc40 gene are excluded, the rest is essentially the same as the whole hsp40 gene. The intron/exon boundaries of the hsc40 and hsp40 genes are conserved with respect to amino acid coding, indicating that the hsp40 gene might have arisen from a duplicated hsc40 gene, which developed a new transcription-regulatory mechanism in the second intron. Hsc40 is evolutionally conserved. There is over 95% sequence identity between the putative mouse and human hsc40 proteins. However, there is only 60% sequence identity between the hsc40 and hsp40 proteins from either human or mouse cells. Northern blot analysis of various tissues and cells in culture revealed that this gene was expressed under normal conditions, and its expression was further increased after various stress treatments. The expression pattern of the hsc40 gene is very similar to that of the hsc70 gene under both normal and stress conditions, whereas the hsp40 gene exhibited an expression pattern more similar to that of hsp70 genes on the same Northern blots. These results, considered along with the high rate of sequence conservation between the same proteins from different species and high rate of variation between the two different proteins from the same species, strongly suggest that hsc40 and hsp40 may perform different functions and/or have different specificities in the cell.
serum response	SRF	Identification of proteins that interact with NF-YA. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to show that the serum response factor (SRF) and zinc-fingers and homeobox 1 (ZHXI) proteins interact with the A subunit of nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA). GST pulldown assays revealed that both proteins interact specifically with NF-YA in vitro. Amino acids located between 272 and 564, a region that contains two homeodomains, are required for the interaction of ZHX1 with NF-YA. Two different domains of NF-YA, a glutamine-rich region and a serine/threonine-rich region, are necessary for the interactions with ZHX1 and SRF, respectively.
fanconi an	FA	A novel BTB/POZ transcriptional repressor protein interacts with the Fanconi anemia group C protein and PLZF. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility syndrome. The phenotype includes developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cell cycle abnormalities. At least eight complementation groups (A-H) exist, and although three of the corresponding complementation group genes have been cloned, they lack recognizable motifs, and their functions are unknown. We have isolated a binding partner for the Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We show that the novel gene, FAZF, encodes a 486 amino acid protein containing a conserved amino terminal BTB/POZ protein interaction domain and three C-terminal Krüppel-like zinc fingers. FAZF is homologous to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, which has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor by recruitment of nuclear corepressors (N-CoR, Sin3, and HDAC1 complex). Consistent with a role in FA, BTB/POZ-containing proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis, limb morphogenesis, hematopoiesis, and proliferation. We show that FAZF is a transcriptional repressor that is able to bind to the same DNA target sequences as PLZF. Our data suggest that the FAZF/FANCC interaction maps to a region of FANCC deleted in FA patients with a severe disease phenotype. We also show that FAZF and wild-type FANCC can colocalize in nuclear foci, whereas a patient-derived mutant FANCC that is compromised for nuclear localization cannot. These results suggest that the function of FANCC may be linked to a transcriptional repression pathway involved in chromatin remodeling.
promyelocytic leukemia zinc	PLZF	A novel BTB/POZ transcriptional repressor protein interacts with the Fanconi anemia group C protein and PLZF. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility syndrome. The phenotype includes developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cell cycle abnormalities. At least eight complementation groups (A-H) exist, and although three of the corresponding complementation group genes have been cloned, they lack recognizable motifs, and their functions are unknown. We have isolated a binding partner for the Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We show that the novel gene, FAZF, encodes a 486 amino acid protein containing a conserved amino terminal BTB/POZ protein interaction domain and three C-terminal Krüppel-like zinc fingers. FAZF is homologous to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, which has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor by recruitment of nuclear corepressors (N-CoR, Sin3, and HDAC1 complex).

jun amino - terminal	JNK	Interaction of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase interacting protein-1 with p190 rhoGEF and its localization in differentiated neurons. c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) was originally identified as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of JNK. More recently, JIP-1 was proposed to function as a scaffold protein by complexing specific components of the JNK signaling pathway, namely JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, and mixed lineage kinase 3. We have identified the human homologue of JIP-1 that contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain in addition to a JNK binding domain and an Src homology 3 domain. To identify binding targets for the hJIP-1 PTB domain, a mouse embryo cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. One clone encoded a 191-amino acid region of the neuronal protein rhoGEF, an exchange factor for rhoA. Overexpression of rhoGEF promotes cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell rounding in NIE-115 neuronal cells. The interaction of JIP-1 with rhoGEF was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins from lysates of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Using glutathione S-transferase rhoGEF fusion proteins containing deletion or point mutations, we identified a putative PTB binding site within rhoGEF. This binding site does not contain tyrosine, indicating that the JIP PTB domain, like that of Xll alpha and Numb, binds independently of phosphotyrosine. Several forms of endogenous JIP-1 protein can be detected in neuronal cell lines. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis localized endogenous JIP-1 to the tip of the neurites in differentiated NIE-115 and PC12 cells. The interaction of JIP-1 with rhoGEF and its subcellular localization suggests that JIP-1 may function to specifically localize a signaling complex in neuronal cells.

ribosomal	rp	Gene organization and sequence of the region containing the ribosomal protein genes RPL13A and RPS11 in the human genome and conserved features in the mouse genome. We have determined the organization and sequence of the region containing two ribosomal protein (rp) genes in the human and mouse genomes. The two genes, human RPL13A and RPS11, and mouse Rpl13a and Rps11, are tandemly located in both genomes with an interval of only 4.6kb in the case of the human genes and 1.6kb in the case of the mouse genes. The human RPL13A and RPS11 are 4236bp and 3254bp in length and comprise eight and five exons respectively, whereas the mouse Rps11 is 1951bp long and has five exons. Structural comparison of these genes, including previously reported mouse Rpl13a, revealed a significant conservation of sequences in the promoter regions. Although most rp genes are dispersed throughout the human genome, the conserved features and adjacent localization indicate possible coordinate transcription of the two genes. Furthermore, we have found that four small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes are located in the introns of the two rp genes, both human and mouse. U32, U33, and U34 snoRNAs are encoded in introns 2, 4, and 5 of RPL13A respectively, and U35 in the sixth intron of RPL13A and the third intron of RPS11. The same organization of these snoRNA genes was also observed in the case of the mouse genes.

sialic acid storage	SASD	A new gene, encoding an anion transporter, is mutated in sialic acid storage diseases. Sialic acid storage diseases (SASD, MIM 269920) are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders that may present as a severe infantile form (ISSD) or a slowly progressive adult form, which is prevalent in Finland (Salla disease). The main symptoms are hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia and mental retardation; visceromegaly and coarse features are also present in infantile cases. Progressive cerebellar atrophy and dysmyelination have been documented by magnetic resonance imaging (ref. 4). Enlarged lysosomes are seen on electron microscopic studies and patients excrete large amounts of free sialic acid in urine. A H+/anionic sugar symporter mechanism for sialic acid and glucuronic acid is impaired in lysosomal membranes from Salla and ISSD patients. The locus for Salla disease was assigned to a region of approximately 200 kb on chromosome 6q14-q15 in a linkage study using Finnish families. Salla disease and ISSD were further shown to be allelic disorders. A physical map with P1 and PAC clones was constructed to cover the 200-kb area flanked by the loci D6S280 and D6S1622, providing the basis for precise physical positioning of the gene. Here we describe a new gene, SLC17A5 (also known as AST), encoding a protein (sialin) with a predicted transport function that belongs to a family of anion/cation symporters (ACS). We found a homozygous SLC17A5 mutation (R39C) in five Finnish patients with Salla disease and six different SLC17A5 mutations in six ISSD patients of different ethnic origins. Our observations suggest that mutations in SLC17A5 are the primary cause of lysosomal sialic acid storage diseases.

progenitor b	pro-B cell	An essential role for BLNK in human B cell development. The signal transduction events that control the progenitor B cell (pro-B cell) to precursor B cell (pre-B cell) transition have not been well delineated. In evaluating patients with absent B cells, a male with a homozygous splice defect in the cytoplasmic adapter protein BLNK (B cell linker protein) was identified. Although this patient had normal numbers of pro-B cells, he had no pre-B cells or mature B cells, indicating that BLNK plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition. The immune system and overall growth and development were otherwise normal in this patient, suggesting that BLNK function is highly specific.

human immunodeficiency	HIV	Use of chemokine receptors by poxviruses. Chemokine receptors serve as portals of entry for certain intracellular pathogens, most notably human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Myxoma virus is a member of the poxvirus family that induces a lethal systemic disease in rabbits, but no poxvirus receptor has ever been defined. Rodent fibroblasts (3T3) that cannot be infected with myxoma virus could be made fully permissive for myxoma virus infection by expression of any one of several human chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR4. Conversely, infection of 3T3-CCR5 cells can be inhibited by RANTES, anti-CCR5 polyclonal antibody, or herbimycin A but not by monoclonal antibodies that block HIV-1 infection or by pertussis toxin. These findings suggest that poxviruses, like HIV, are able to use chemokine receptors to infect specific cell subtypes, notably migratory leukocytes, but that their mechanisms of receptor interactions are distinct.
metalloproteinase - like , disintegrin - like , cysteine -	MDC	Identification, sequence analysis and expression of transcripts encoding a putative metalloproteinase, eMDC II, in human and macaque epididymis. The metalloproteinase-like, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich (MDC) family is a large group of sequence-related proteins, first characterized in the male reproductive tract, but subsequently also identified in non-reproductive tissues. Their primary translation products are of approximately 90 kDa and each can be divided into distinct domains which show remarkable homology to reprolysins; snake venom haemorrhagic components possessing metalloproteinase and/or disintegrin domains. Several MDC proteins are abundantly-expressed in the male reproductive tract, suggesting functions in fertility. We now describe the cloning, sequence determination and characterization of transcripts encoding the human and macaque (Macaca fascicularis) orthologues of a novel member of the MDC family (eMDC II) which is abundantly-expressed in the epididymis. Unlike many MDC proteins expressed in the reproductive tract, eMDC II possesses the extended 'catalytic centre' consensus sequence characteristic of a reprolysin-like metalloproteinase. This suggests that eMDC II has proteolytic activity.
reverse transcription - polymerase chain	RT-PCR	Expression of uteroglobin in the human endometrium. Uteroglobin is a progesterone binding protein, a member of the antiflammin gene family and possibly a novel cytokine. Initially, uteroglobin was identified as the major protein of rabbit uterine secretion during the phase of preimplantation. Counterparts of the rabbit uteroglobin or its gene are described in rat, mouse, hamster, hare, pig, horse and human. While uteroglobin appears as one of the most extensively studied proteins, particularly its physico-chemical properties, including its crystal structure and its gene, the true physiological role of this protein still remains to be unravelled. Essential to understanding the significance of human uteroglobin in reproductive organs, particularly in the endometrium, is a knowledge of the spatial and chronological expression of this secretory protein. Our studies on 115 volunteers combined reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and quantitative assessment by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for uteroglobin. The expression, localization and release of uteroglobulin in the human endometrium are presented. Secretory uteroglobin is found in endometrial tissue homogenates in highest levels of expression during the early luteal phase (days 15-19, 340 pg/mg total protein). In turn, uteroglobin is released into the uterine lumen in peak amounts during the receptive phase of the menstrual cycle (mid-luteal phase, days 20-23, secretion level 833.4 pg/mg total protein). Our immunohistochemical studies match with these results, as uteroglobin is located during the early and mid-luteal phase in the apical compartments of endometrial gland cells. These observations strongly suggest an involvement of uteroglobin in endometrial preparations for implantation.
snare	SNAK	Phosphorylation of SNAP-23 by the novel kinase SNAK regulates t-SNARE complex assembly. The docking and fusion of cargo-containing vesicles with target membranes of eukaryotic cells is mediated by the interaction of SNARE proteins present on both vesicle and target membranes. In many cases, the target membrane SNARE, or t-SNARE, exists as a complex of syntaxin with a member of the SNAP-25 family of palmitoylated proteins. We have identified a novel human kinase SNAK (SNARE kinase) that specifically phosphorylates the nonneuronal t-SNARE SNAP-23 in vivo. Interestingly, only SNAP-23 that is not assembled into t-SNARE complexes is phosphorylated by SNAK, and phosphorylated SNAP-23 resides exclusively in the cytosol. Coexpression with SNAK significantly enhances the stability of unassembled SNAP-23, and as a consequence, the assembly of newly synthesized SNAP-23 with syntaxin is augmented. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 by SNAK enhances the kinetics of t-SNARE assembly in vivo.
cutaneous lymphocyte - associated	CLA	CTACK, a skin-associated chemokine that preferentially attracts skin-homing memory T cells. In contrast to naive lymphocytes, memory/effector lymphocytes can access nonlymphoid effector sites and display restricted, often tissue-selective, migration behavior. The cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) defines a subset of circulating memory T cells that selectively localize in cutaneous sites mediated in part by the interaction of CLA with its vascular ligand E-selectin. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a CC chemokine, cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK). Both human and mouse CTACK are detected only in skin by Southern and Northern blot analyses. Specifically, CTACK message is found in the mouse epidermis and in human keratinocytes, and anti-CTACK mAbs predominantly stain the epithelium. Finally, CTACK selectively attracts CLA(+) memory T cells. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for CTACK in recruitment of CLA(+) T cells to cutaneous sites. CTACK is predominantly expressed in the skin and selectively attracts a tissue-specific subpopulation of memory lymphocytes.

acute lymphoblastic	ALL	AF5q31, a newly identified AF4-related gene, is fused to MLL in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia with ins(5;11)(q31;q13q23). Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with MLL gene rearrangements is characterized by early pre-B phenotype (CD10(-)/CD19(+)) and poor treatment outcome. The t(4;11), creating MLL-AF4 chimeric transcripts, is the predominant 11q23 chromosome translocation in infant ALL and is associated with extremely poor prognosis as compared with other 11q23 translocations. We analyzed an infant early preB ALL with ins(5;11)(q31;q13q23) and identified the AF5q31 gene on chromosome 5q31 as a fusion partner of the MLL gene. The AF5q31 gene, which encoded a protein of 1,163 aa, was located in the vicinity of the cytokine cluster region of chromosome 5q31 and contained at least 16 exons. The AF5q31 gene was expressed in fetal heart, lung, and brain at relatively high levels and fetal liver at a low level, but the expression in these tissues decreased in adults. The AF5q31 protein was homologous to AF4-related proteins, including AF4, LAF4, and FMR2. The AF5q31 and AF4 proteins had three homologous regions, including the transactivation domain of AF4, and the breakpoint of AF5q31 was located within the region homologous to the transactivation domain of AF4. Furthermore, the clinical features of this patient with the MLL-AF5q31 fusion transcript, characterized by the early pre-B phenotype (CD10(-)/CD19(+)) and poor outcome, were similar to those of patients having MLL-AF4 chimeric transcripts. These findings suggest that AF5q31 and AF4 might define a new family particularly involved in the pathogenesis of 11q23-associated-ALL.
amyloid protein	APP	Membrane-anchored aspartyl protease with Alzheimer's disease beta-secretase activity. Mutations in the gene encoding the amyloid protein precursor (APP) cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Cleavage of APP by unidentified proteases, referred to as beta- and gamma-secretases, generates the amyloid beta-peptide, the main component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. The disease-causing mutations flank the protease cleavage sites in APP and facilitate its cleavage. Here we identify a new membrane-bound aspartyl protease (Asp2) with beta-secretase activity. The Asp2 gene is expressed widely in brain and other tissues. Decreasing the expression of Asp2 in cells reduces amyloid beta-peptide production and blocks the accumulation of the carboxy-terminal APP fragment that is created by beta-secretase cleavage. Solubilized Asp2 protein cleaves a synthetic APP peptide substrate at the beta-secretase site, and the rate of cleavage is increased tenfold by a mutation associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in Sweden. Thus, Asp2 is a new protein target for drugs that are designed to block the production of amyloid beta-peptide peptide and the consequent formation of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease.
amyloid precursor	APP	Purification and cloning of amyloid precursor protein beta-secretase from human brain. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which is thought to be causal for the pathology and subsequent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Cleavage by beta-secretase at the amino terminus of the Abeta peptide sequence, between residues 671 and 672 of APP, leads to the generation and extracellular release of beta-cleaved soluble APP, and a corresponding cell-associated carboxy-terminal fragment. Cleavage of the C-terminal fragment by gamma-secretase(s) leads to the formation of Abeta. The pathogenic mutation K670M671-->N670L671 at the beta-secretase cleavage site in APP, which was discovered in a Swedish family with familial Alzheimer's disease, leads to increased beta-secretase cleavage of the mutant substrate. Here we describe a membrane-bound enzyme activity that cleaves full-length APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site, and find it to be the predominant beta-cleavage activity in human brain. We have purified this enzyme activity to homogeneity from human brain using a new substrate analogue inhibitor of the enzyme activity, and show that the purified enzyme has all the properties predicted for beta-secretase. Cloning and expression of the enzyme reveals that human brain beta-secretase is a new membrane-bound aspartic proteinase.

dyskeratosis congeni	DKC	A telomerase component is defective in the human disease dyskeratosis congenita. The X-linked form of the human disease dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dyskerin. Sufferers have defects in highly regenerative tissues such as skin and bone marrow, chromosome instability and a predisposition to develop certain types of malignancy. Dyskerin is a putative pseudouridine synthase, and it has been suggested that DKC may be caused by a defect in ribosomal RNA processing. Here we show that dyskerin is associated not only with H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs, but also with human telomerase RNA, which contains an H/ACA RNA motif. Telomerase adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends using an internal region of its RNA as a template, and is required for the indefinite proliferation of primary human cells. We find that primary fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from DKC-affected males are not detectably deficient in conventional H/ACA small nucleolar RNA accumulation or function; however, DKC cells have a lower level of telomerase RNA, produce lower levels of telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres than matched normal cells. The pathology of DKC is consistent with compromised telomerase function leading to a defect in telomere maintenance, which may limit the proliferative capacity of human somatic cells in epithelia and blood.
None	IDH	Identification and functional characterization of a novel, tissue-specific NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase beta subunit isoform. To understand the interactions and functional role of each of the three mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), we have characterized human cDNAs encoding two beta isoforms (beta(1) and beta(2)) and the gamma subunit. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences revealed that beta(1) and beta(2) encode 349 and 354 amino acids, respectively, and the two isoforms only differ in the most carboxyl 28 amino acids. The gamma cDNA encodes 354 amino acids and is almost identical to monkey IDHgamma. Northern analyses revealed that the smaller beta(2) transcript (1.3 kilobases) is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, whereas the larger beta(1) mRNA (1.6 kilobases) is prevalent in nonmuscle tissues. Sequence analysis of the IDHbeta gene indicates that the difference in the C-terminal 28 amino acids between beta(1) and beta(2) proteins results from alternative splicing of a single transcript. Among the various combinations of human IDH subunits co-expressed in bacteria, alphabetagamma, alphabeta, and alphagamma combinations exhibited significant amounts of IDH activity, whereas subunits produced alone and betagamma showed no detectable activity. These data suggest that the alpha is the catalytic subunit and that at least one of the other two subunits plays an essential supporting role for activity. Substitution of beta(1) with beta(2) in the co-expression system lowered the pH optimum for IDH activity from 8.0 to 7.6. This difference in optimal pH was analogous to what was observed in mouse kidney and brain (beta(1) prevalent; optimal pH 8.0) versus heart (beta(2) prevalent; pH 7.6) mitochondria. Experiments with a specially designed splicing reporter construct stably transfected into HT1080 cells indicate that acidic conditions favor a splicing pattern responsible for the muscle- and heart-specific beta(2) isoform. Taken together, these data indicate a regulatory role of IDHbeta isoforms in determining the pH optimum for IDH activity through the tissue-specific alternative splicing.
None	FR	Chemoattractant receptors activate distinct pathways for chemotaxis and secretion. Role of G-protein usage. Human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors activate chemotactic and cytotoxic pathways to varying degrees and also activate different G-proteins depending on the receptor and the cell-type. To determine the relationship between G-protein usage and the biological and biochemical responses activated, receptors for the chemoattractants formyl peptides (FR), platelet-activating factor (PAFR), and leukotriene B(4) (BLTR) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Pertussis toxin (Ptx) served as a Galpha(i) inhibitor. These receptors were chosen to represent the spectrum of G(i) usage as Ptx had differential effects on their ability to induce calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and exocytosis with complete inhibition of all responses by FR, intermediate effects on BLTR, and little effect on PAFR. Ptx did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR but inhibited phosphorylation of FR. In contrast, chemotaxis to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, leukotriene B(4), and platelet-activating factor was completely blocked by Ptx. Wortmannin, a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, also completely blocked ligand-induced chemotaxis by all receptors but did not affect calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis; however, it partially blocked the exocytosis response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the platelet-activating factor. Membrane ruffling and pseudopod extension via the BLTR was also completely inhibited by both Ptx and wortmannin. These data suggest that of the chemoattractant receptors studied, G-protein usage varies with FR being totally dependent on G(i), whereas BLTR and PAFR utilize both G(i) and a Ptx-insensitive G-protein. Both Ptx-sensitive and -insensitive G-protein usage can mediate the activation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and exocytosis by chemoattractant receptors. Chemotaxis, however, had an absolute requirement for a G(i)-mediated pathway.
None	PAFR	Chemoattractant receptors activate distinct pathways for chemotaxis and secretion. Role of G-protein usage. Human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors activate chemotactic and cytotoxic pathways to varying degrees and also activate different G-proteins depending on the receptor and the cell-type. To determine the relationship between G-protein usage and the biological and biochemical responses activated, receptors for the chemoattractants formyl peptides (FR), platelet-activating factor (PAFR), and leukotriene B(4) (BLTR) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Pertussis toxin (Ptx) served as a Galpha(i) inhibitor. These receptors were chosen to represent the spectrum of G(i) usage as Ptx had differential effects on their ability to induce calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and exocytosis with complete inhibition of all responses by FR, intermediate effects on BLTR, and little effect on PAFR. Ptx did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR but inhibited phosphorylation of FR. In contrast, chemotaxis to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, leukotriene B(4), and platelet-activating factor was completely blocked by Ptx. Wortmannin, a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, also completely blocked ligand-induced chemotaxis by all receptors but did not affect calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis; however, it partially blocked the exocytosis response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the platelet-activating factor. Membrane ruffling and pseudopod extension via the BLTR was also completely inhibited by both Ptx and wortmannin. These data suggest that of the chemoattractant receptors studied, G-protein usage varies with FR being totally dependent on G(i), whereas BLTR and PAFR utilize both G(i) and a Ptx-insensitive G-protein. Both Ptx-sensitive and -insensitive G-protein usage can mediate the activation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and exocytosis by chemoattractant receptors.

neutral sphingomyelin	N-SMase	Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression of a novel human neutral sphingomyelinase. Neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) has emerged as an important cell membrane-associated enzyme that participates in several signal transduction and cell regulatory phenomena. Using expression cloning, we have identified a 3.7-kilobase pair cDNA transcript for N-SMase whose open reading frame predicts a 397-amino acid polypeptide. Transfection of COS-7 cells with cDNA for N-SMase resulted in a marked increase in N-SMase activity. Recombinant N-SMase (r-N-SMase) had the following physical-chemical properties. Mg(2+) activated and Cu(2+) and glutathione inhibited the activity of r-N-SMase. In contrast, dithiothreitol did not alter the activity of the enzyme. Of several phospholipids examined, sphingomyelin was the preferred substrate for r-N-SMase. The apparent molecular mass of r-N-SMase derived from COS-7 cells was approximately 90 kDa, similar to the native neutral sphingomyelinase prepared from human urine. However, upon expression in Escherichia coli, the apparent molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was approximately 45 kDa. We speculate that this apparent difference in recombinant enzymes derived from COS-7 and E. coli cells may be due to extensive post-transcriptional changes. r-N-SMase has numerous post-transcriptional modification sites such as phosphorylation sites via protein kinase C, casein kinase II, tyrosine kinase, and cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases as well as sites for glycosylation and myristoylation. Amino acid sequence alignment studies revealed that r-N-SMase has some similarity to acid sphingomyelinase and significant homology to the death domains of tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-1 and Fas/Apo-I. We believe that the molecular cloning and characterization of N-SMase cDNA will accelerate the process to define its role as a key regulator in apoptosis, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, and other cell regulatory pathways.

mitogen - activated	MAP	A novel regulatory mechanism of MAP kinases activation and nuclear translocation mediated by PKA and the PTP-SL tyrosine phosphatase. Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-SL retains mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by association through a kinase interaction motif (KIM) and tyrosine dephosphorylation. The related tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and STEP were phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The PKA phosphorylation site on PTP-SL was identified as the Ser(231) residue, located within the KIM. Upon phosphorylation of Ser(231), PTP-SL binding and tyrosine dephosphorylation of the MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38alpha were impaired. Furthermore, treatment of COS-7 cells with PKA activators, or overexpression of the Calpha catalytic subunit of PKA, inhibited the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 and p38alpha by wild-type PTP-SL, but not by a PTP-SL S231A mutant. These findings support the existence of a novel mechanism by which PKA may regulate the activation and translocation to the nucleus of MAP kinases.

survival of motor	SMN	Gemin3: A novel DEAD box protein that interacts with SMN, the spinal muscular atrophy gene product, and is a component of gems. The survival of motor neurons (SMN) gene is the disease gene of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common motor neuron degenerative disease. The SMN protein is part of a complex containing several proteins, of which one, SIP1 (SMN interacting protein 1), has been characterized so far. The SMN complex is found in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it is concentrated in bodies called gems. In the cytoplasm, SMN and SIP1 interact with the Sm core proteins of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and they play a critical role in snRNP assembly. In the nucleus, SMN is required for pre-mRNA splicing, likely by serving in the regeneration of snRNPs. Here, we report the identification of another component of the SMN complex, a novel DEAD box putative RNA helicase, named Gemin3. Gemin3 interacts directly with SMN, as well as with SmB, SmD2, and SmD3. Immunolocalization studies using mAbs to Gemin3 show that it colocalizes with SMN in gems. Gemin3 binds SMN via its unique COOH-terminal domain, and SMN mutations found in some SMA patients strongly reduce this interaction. The presence of a DEAD box motif in Gemin3 suggests that it may provide the catalytic activity that plays a critical role in the function of the SMN complex on RNPs.

	SERP1	Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1)/Ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) stabilizes membrane proteins during stress and facilitates subsequent glycosylation. Application of differential display to cultured rat astrocytes subjected to hypoxia allowed cloning of a novel cDNA, termed stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1). Expression of SERP1 was enhanced in vitro by hypoxia and/or reoxygenation or other forms of stress, causing accumulation of unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and in vivo by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The SERP1 cDNA encodes a 66-amino acid polypeptide which was found to be identical to ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) and bearing 29% identity to yeast suppressor of SecY 6 protein (YSY6p), suggesting participation in pathways controlling membrane protein biogenesis at ER. In cultured 293 cells subjected to ER stress, overexpression of SERP1/RAMP4 suppressed aggregation and/or degradation of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins, and subsequently, facilitated their glycosylation when the stress was removed. SERP1/RAMP4 interacted with Sec61alpha and Sec61beta, which are subunits of translocon, and a molecular chaperon calnexin. Furthermore, Sec61alpha and Sec61beta, but not SERP1/RAMP4, were found to associate with newly synthesized integral membrane proteins under stress. These results suggest that stabilization of membrane proteins in response to stress involves the concerted action of a rescue unit in the ER membrane comprised of SERP1/RAMP4, other components of translocon, and molecular chaperons in ER.

cytolytic t lymphoc	CTL	A new antigen recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes on a human kidney tumor results from reverse strand transcription. By stimulating blood lymphocytes from a renal cell carcinoma patient in vitro with the autologous tumor cells, we obtained cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones that killed several autologous and allogeneic histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B7 renal carcinoma cell lines. We identified the target antigen of these CTLs by screening COS cells transfected with the HLA-B7 cDNA and with a cDNA library prepared with RNA from the tumor cells. The antigenic peptide recognized by the CTLs has the sequence LPRWPPPQL and is encoded by a new gene, which we named RU2. This gene is transcribed in both directions. The antigenic peptide is not encoded by the sense transcript, RU2S, which is expressed ubiquitously. It is encoded by an antisense transcript, RU2AS, which starts from a cryptic promoter located on the reverse strand of the first intron and ends up on the reverse strand of the RU2S promoter, which contains a polyadenylation signal. This mechanism of antigen expression is unprecedented and further illustrates the notion that many peptides recognized by T cells cannot be predicted from the primary structure of the major product of the encoding gene. Antisense transcript RU2AS is expressed in a high proportion of tumors of various histological types. It is absent in most normal tissues, but is expressed in testis and kidney, and, at lower levels, in urinary bladder and liver. Short-term cultures of normal epithelial cells from the renal proximal tubule expressed significant levels of RU2AS message and were recognized by the CTLs. Therefore, this antigen is not tumor specific, but corresponds to a self-antigen with restricted tissue distribution.

epidermal growth factor -	EG	Sequence, recombinant expression and tissue localization of two novel extracellular matrix proteins, fibulin-3 and fibulin-4. Fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 have previously been identified as basement membrane and microfibrillar proteins with a broad binding repertoire for other extracellular ligands. Here we report on the cloning and sequence analysis of human fibulin-3 (487 residues), also known as protein S1-5, and fibulin-4 (443 residues). These novel members of this protein family are most closely related to fibulin-1C. They consist of a C-terminal globular domain III, also shared by the fibrillins, a central rod-like element composed of five calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (EG) modules (domain II) and an N-terminal interrupted EG module (domain I) which replaces the anaphylatoxin-like modules of the other fibulins. This predicted domain structure was supported by electron microscopy of fibulin-4, which demonstrated short rods. Northern blots showed that both novel fibulins are expressed in several human tissues to a variable extent and that they are up-regulated in quiescent fibroblasts. Specific antibodies which were raised against each of the novel fibulins did not cross-react with fibulin-1. Immunohistology of adult mouse tissues showed that fibulin-3, fibulin-4 and fibulin-1 have overlapping but distinct extracellular tissue localizations. A particularly prominent feature was the staining of variable sets of large and small blood vessels.
replication initiation - region protein 60 k	RIP60	The dhfr oribeta-binding protein RIP60 contains 15 zinc fingers: DNA binding and looping by the central three fingers and an associated proline-rich region. Initiation of DNA replication occurs with high frequency within oribeta, a short region 3' to the Chinese hamster dhfr gene. Homodimers of RIP60 (replication initiation-region protein 60 kDA) purified from nuclear extract bind two ATT-rich sites in oribeta and foster the formation of a twisted 720 bp DNA loop in vitro. Using a one hybrid screen in yeast, we have cloned the cDNA for human RIP60. RIP60 contains 15 C(2)H(2)zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding motifs organized in three clusters, termed hand Z1 (ZFs 1-5), hand Z2 (ZFs 6-8) and hand Z3 (ZFs 9-15). A proline-rich region is located between hands Z2 and Z3. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments show hands Z1 and Z2 independently bind the oribeta RIP60 sites specifically, but with different affinities. Hand Z3 binds DNA, but displays no specificity for RIP60 sites. Ligation enhancement, DNase I footprinting, and atomic force microscopy assays show that hand Z2 and a portion of the associated proline-rich region is sufficient for protein multimerization on DNA and DNA looping in vitro. Polyomavirus origin-dependent plasmid replication assays show RIP60 has weak replication enhancer activity, suggesting that RIP60 does not harbor a transcriptional transactivation domain. Because vertebrate origins of replication have no known consensus sequence, we suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as RIP60 may act as accessory factors in origin identification prior to the assembly of pre-initiation complexes.

Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments show hands Z1 and Z2 independently bind the oribeta RIP60 sites specifically, but with different affinities. Hand Z3 binds DNA, but displays no specificity for RIP60 sites. Ligation enhancement, DNase I footprinting, and atomic force microscopy assays show that hand Z2 and a portion of the associated proline-rich region is sufficient for protein multimerization on DNA and DNA looping in vitro. Polyomavirus origin-dependent plasmid replication assays show RIP60 has weak replication enhancer activity, suggesting that RIP60 does not harbor a transcriptional transactivation domain. Because vertebrate origins of replication have no known consensus sequence, we suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as RIP60 may act as accessory factors in origin identification prior to the assembly of pre-initiation complexes.
zfs 1 -	Z1	The dhfr oribeta-binding protein RIP60 contains 15 zinc fingers: DNA binding and looping by the central three fingers and an associated proline-rich region. Initiation of DNA replication occurs with high frequency within oribeta, a short region 3' to the Chinese hamster dhfr gene. Homodimers of RIP60 (replication initiation-region protein 60 kDA) purified from nuclear extract bind two ATT-rich sites in oribeta and foster the formation of a twisted 720 bp DNA loop in vitro. Using a one hybrid screen in yeast, we have cloned the cDNA for human RIP60. RIP60 contains 15 C(2)H(2)zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding motifs organized in three clusters, termed hand Z1 (ZFs 1-5), hand Z2 (ZFs 6-8) and hand Z3 (ZFs 9-15).

autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraple	AD-HSP	Spastin, a new AAA protein, is altered in the most frequent form of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. Autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. Among the four loci causing AD-HSP identified so far, the SPG4 locus at chromosome 2p2-1p22 has been shown to account for 40-50% of all AD-HSP families. Using a positional cloning strategy based on obtaining sequence of the entire SPG4 interval, we identified a candidate gene encoding a new member of the AAA protein family, which we named spastin. Sequence analysis of this gene in seven SPG4-linked pedigrees revealed several DNA modifications, including missense, nonsense and splice-site mutations. Both SPG4 and its mouse orthologue were shown to be expressed early and ubiquitously in fetal and adult tissues. The sequence homologies and putative subcellular localization of spastin suggest that this ATPase is involved in the assembly or function of nuclear protein complexes.
pal	pa	The pallid gene encodes a novel, syntaxin 13-interacting protein involved in platelet storage pool deficiency. Pallid (pa) is 1 of 13 platelet storage pool deficiency (SPD) mouse mutants. pa animals suffer from prolonged bleeding time, pigment dilution, kidney lysosomal enzyme elevation, serum alpha1-antitrypsin activity deficiency and abnormal otolith formation. As with other mouse mutants of this class, characterization of pa mice suggests a defect in organelle biosynthesis. Here we describe the physical mapping, positional cloning, and mutational and functional analysis of the gene that is defective in pa mice. It encodes a ubiquitously expressed, highly charged 172-amino-acid protein (termed pallidin) with no homology to known proteins. We detected a nonsense mutation at codon 69 of this gene in the pallid mutant. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we discovered that pallidin interacts with syntaxin 13, a t-SNARE protein that mediates vesicle-docking and fusion. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Immunofluorescence studies corroborate that the cellular distribution of pallidin overlaps that of syntaxin 13. Whereas the mocha and pearl SPD mutants have defects in Ap-3, our findings suggest that pa SPD mutants are defective in a more downstream event of vesicle-trafficking: namely, vesicle-docking and fusion.

deleted in esophageal cancer	DEC1	Isolation and mutational analysis of a novel human cDNA, DEC1 (deleted in esophageal cancer 1), derived from the tumor suppressor locus in 9q32. The long arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one or more putative tumor suppressor genes that are mutated in squamous cell carcinomas. This region shows frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in carcinomas arising in several developmentally related tissues, including the esophagus, head and neck, lung, and urinary bladder. We previously delineated the commonly deleted region in a panel of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas to a approximately 200 kb genomic segment at 9q32. Here we report the isolation of a novel gene, DEC1 (deleted in esophageal cancer 1), from the target region. Mutational analysis of this gene by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction disclosed significantly reduced expression of DEC1 in 8 of 13 (62%) esophageal cancer cell lines and in 16 of 30 (53%) primary squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. However, no genetic alteration was detected in any of the cancers examined. Introduction of DEC1 cDNA into 3 cancer cell lines that lacked expression of DEC1 significantly suppressed cell growth, whereas antisense cDNA or the vector DNA alone did not. Given the reduced expression of the DEC1 gene in esophageal cancer, the high frequency of LOH at 9q32 in esophageal carcinomas, and the fact that the DEC1 cDNA can suppress growth of some cancer cells in vitro, we suggest that the DEC1 gene is a candidate tumor suppressor in 9q32.

starga	stg	Identification of three novel Ca(2+) channel gamma subunit genes reveals molecular diversification by tandem and chromosome duplication. Gene duplication is believed to be an important evolutionary mechanism for generating functional diversity within genomes. The accumulated products of ancient duplication events can be readily observed among the genes encoding voltage-dependent Ca(2+) ion channels. Ten paralogous genes have been identified that encode isoforms of the alpha(1) subunit, four that encode beta subunits, and three that encode alpha(2)delta subunits. Until recently, only a single gene encoding a muscle-specific isoform of the Ca(2+) channel gamma subunit (CACNG1) was known. Expression of a distantly related gene in the brain was subsequently demonstrated upon isolation of the Cacng2 gene, which is mutated in the mouse neurological mutant stargazer (stg). In this study, we sought to identify additional genes that encoded gamma subunits. Because gene duplication often generates paralogs that remain in close syntenic proximity (tandem duplication) or are copied onto related daughter chromosomes (chromosome or whole-genome duplication), we hypothesized that the known positions of CACNG1 and CACNG2 could be used to predict the likely locations of additional gamma subunit genes. Low-stringency genomic sequence analysis of targeted regions led to the identification of three novel Ca(2+) channel gamma subunit genes, CACNG3, CACNG4, and CACNG5, on chromosomes 16 and 17. These results demonstrate the value of genome evolution models for the identification of distantly related members of gene families.
hereditary non - polyposis colon	HNPCC	MLH3: a DNA mismatch repair gene associated with mammalian microsatellite instability. DNA mismatch repair is important because of its role in maintaining genomic integrity and its association with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). To identify new human mismatch repair proteins, we probed nuclear extracts with the conserved carboxy-terminal MLH1 interaction domain. Here we describe the cloning and complete genomic sequence of MLH3, which encodes a new DNA mismatch repair protein that interacts with MLH1. MLH3 is more similar to mismatch repair proteins from yeast, plants, worms and bacteria than to any known mammalian protein, suggesting that its conserved sequence may confer unique functions in mice and humans. Cells in culture stably expressing a dominant-negative MLH3 protein exhibit microsatellite instability. Mlh3 is highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelium and physically maps to the mouse complex trait locus colon cancer susceptibility I (Ccs1). Although we were unable to identify a mutation in the protein-coding region of Mlh3 in the susceptible mouse strain, colon tumours from congenic Ccs1 mice exhibit microsatellite instability. Functional redundancy among Mlh3, Pms1 and Pms2 may explain why neither Pms1 nor Pms2 mutant mice develop colon cancer, and why PMS1 and PMS2 mutations are only rarely found in HNPCC families.
hailey - hailey	HHD	Mutations in ATP2C1, encoding a calcium pump, cause Hailey-Hailey disease. Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD, MIM 16960) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. Impaired intercellular adhesion and epidermal blistering also occur in individuals with pemphigus (which is due to autoantibodies directed against desmosomal proteins) and in patients with Darier disease (DD, MIM 124200), which is caused by mutations in a gene encoding a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi calcium pump. We report here the identification of mutations in ATP2C1, encoding the human homologue of an ATP-powered pump that sequesters calcium into the Golgi in yeast, in 21 HHD kindreds. Regulation of cytoplasmic calcium is impaired in cultured keratinocytes from HHD patients, and the normal epidermal calcium gradient is attenuated in vivo in HHD patients. Our findings not only provide an understanding of the molecular basis of HHD, but also underscore the importance of calcium control to the functioning of stratified squamous epithelia.

tricho - rhino - phalangeal syndrome type	TRPS I	Mutations in a new gene, encoding a zinc-finger protein, cause tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type I. Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS I, MIM 190350) is a malformation syndrome characterized by craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. TRPS I patients have sparse scalp hair, a bulbous tip of the nose, a long flat philtrum, a thin upper vermilion border and protruding ears. Skeletal abnormalities include cone-shaped epiphyses at the phalanges, hip malformations and short stature. We assigned TRPS1 to human chromosome 8q24. It maps proximal of EXT1, which is affected in a subgroup of patients with multiple cartilaginous exostoses and deleted in all patients with TRPS type II (TRPS II, or Langer-Giedion syndrome, MIM 150230; ref.2-5). We have positionally cloned a gene that spans the chromosomal breakpoint of two patients with TRPS I and is deleted in five patients with TRPS I and an interstitial deletion. Northern-blot analyses revealed transcripts of 7 and 10.5 kb. TRPS1has seven exons and an ORF of 3,843 bp. The predicted protein sequence has two potential nuclear localization signals and an unusual combination of different zinc-finger motifs, including IKAROS-like and GATA-binding sequences. We identified six different nonsense mutations in ten unrelated patients. Our findings suggest that haploinsufficiency for this putative transcription factor causes TRPS I.

leber congenital amauro	LCA	Mutations in a new photoreceptor-pineal gene on 17p cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA, MIM 204000) accounts for at least 5% of all inherited retinal disease and is the most severe inherited retinopathy with the earliest age of onset. Individuals affected with LCA are diagnosed at birth or in the first few months of life with severely impaired vision or blindness, nystagmus and an abnormal or flat electroretinogram (ERG). Mutations in GUCY2D (ref. 3), RPE65 (ref. 4) and CRX (ref. 5) are known to cause LCA, but one study identified disease-causing GUCY2D mutations in only 8 of 15 families whose LCA locus maps to 17p13.1 (ref. 3), suggesting another LCA locus might be located on 17p13.1. Confirming this prediction, the LCA in one Pakistani family mapped to 17p13.1, between D17S849 and D17S960-a region that excludes GUCY2D. The LCA in this family has been designated LCA4 (ref. 6). We describe here a new photoreceptor/pineal-expressed gene, AIPL1 (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1), that maps within the LCA4 candidate region and whose protein contains three tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, consistent with nuclear transport or chaperone activity. A homozygous nonsense mutation at codon 278 is present in all affected members of the original LCA4 family. AIPL1 mutations may cause approximately 20% of recessive LCA, as disease-causing mutations were identified in 3 of 14 LCA families not tested previously for linkage.

human ( h ) and rat ( r ) lutropin / choriogonadotropin	h	Seven non-contiguous intracellular residues of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor dictate the rate of agonist-induced internalization and its sensitivity to non-visual arrestins. The amino acid sequences of the human (h) and rat (r) lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptors (LHR) are 87% identical, but the rate of agonist-induced internalization of the hLHR is approximately 7 times faster than that of the rLHR. Chimeras of the hLHR and the rLHR showed that this rate is dictated by the serpentine domain and the cytoplasmic tail. Further mutational analysis identified seven residues, two adjacent residues in the second intracellular loop (Val/Gln in the rLHR and Ile/His in the hLHR), four non-contiguous residues in the third intracellular loop (Arg/Gln/Thr/Pro in the rLHR and Lys/Arg/Met/Thr in the hLHR), and one in the C-terminal tail (Leu in the rLHR and Phe in the hLHR), that are necessary and sufficient to impart the slow rate of internalization of the rLHR and the fast rate of internalization of the hLHR. The internalization of the rLHR and the hLHR display different sensitivities to the non-visual arrestins. Therefore, we also tested if the simultaneous exchange of these seven residues resulted in the exchange of this property. Since this was found to be the case, we propose that these seven residues identified here form a non-visual arrestin-binding site.

signal recognition	SRP	Signal recognition particle components in the nucleolus. The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein composed of an Alu domain and an S domain. The S domain contains unique sequence SRP RNA and four SRP proteins: SRP19, SRP54, SRP68, and SRP72. SRP interacts with ribosomes to bring translating membrane and secreted proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for proper processing. Additionally, SRP RNA is a member of a family of small nonribosomal RNAs found recently in the nucleolus, suggesting that the nucleolus is more plurifunctional than previously realized. It was therefore of interest to determine whether other SRP components localize to this intranuclear site. In transfected rat fibroblasts, green fluorescent protein fusions of SRP19, SRP68, and SRP72 localized to the nucleolus, as well as to the cytoplasm, as expected. SRP68 also accumulated in the ER, consistent with its affinity for the ER-bound SRP receptor. SRP54 was detected in the cytoplasm as a green fluorescent protein fusion and in immunofluorescence studies, but was not detected in the nucleolus. In situ hybridization experiments also revealed endogenous SRP RNA in the nucleolus. These results demonstrate that SRP RNA and three SRP proteins visit the nucleolus, suggesting that partial SRP assembly, or another unidentified activity of the SRP components, occurs at the nucleolus. SRP54 apparently interacts with nascent SRP beyond the nucleolus, consistent with in vitro reconstitution experiments showing that SRP19 must bind to SRP RNA before SRP54 binds. Our findings support the notion that the nucleolus is the site of assembly and/or interaction between the family of ribonucleoproteins involved in protein synthesis, in addition to ribosomes themselves.

phosphate - activated glutaminas	GA	Molecular cloning, sequencing and expression studies of the human breast cancer cell glutaminase. Phosphate-activated glutaminase (GA) is overexpressed in certain types of tumour but its exact role in tumour cell growth and proliferation is unknown. Here we describe the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone of human breast cancer ZR75 cells, by a combination of lambdagt10 cDNA library screening and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends ('RACE') technique. The cDNA of human GA is 2408 nt with a 1806-base open reading frame encoding a 602-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 66309 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative mitochondrial import presequence of 14 residues at the N-terminal end. Heterologous expression and purification in Escherichia coli yielded a product of the expected molecular size that was recognized by using antibodies against the recombinant human GA. Sequence analyses showed that human GA was highly similar to the rat liver enzyme. Northern gel analysis revealed that the gene is present in human liver, brain and pancreas, in which a major transcript of 2.4 kb was demonstrated, but not in kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, lung or placenta. These results strongly suggest that the first human GA cloned, the GA from ZR-75 breast cancer cells, and presumably those from human liver and brain, are liver-type isoenzymes, in sharp contrast with the present view that considers the kidney type as the isoform expressed in all tissues with GA activity, with the exception of postnatal liver.
viral macrophage inflammatory	vMIP	A highly selective CC chemokine receptor (CCR)8 antagonist encoded by the poxvirus molluscum contagiosum. The MC148 CC chemokine from the human poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (MCV) was probed in parallel with viral macrophage inflammatory protein (vMIP)-II encoded by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) in 16 classified human chemokine receptors. In competition binding using radiolabeled endogenous chemokines as well as radiolabeled MC148, MC148 bound with high affinity only to CCR8. In calcium mobilization assays, MC148 had no effect on its own on any of the chemokine receptors, but in a dose-dependent manner blocked the stimulatory effect of the endogenous I-309 chemokine on CCR8 without affecting chemokine-induced signaling of any other receptor. In contrast, vMIP-II acted as an antagonist on 10 of the 16 chemokine receptors, covering all four classes: XCR, CCR, CXCR, and CX(3)CR. In chemotaxis assays, MC148 specifically blocked the I-309-induced response but, for example, not stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, or interleukin 8-induced chemotaxis. We thus concluded that the two viruses choose two different ways to block the chemokine system: HHV8 encodes the broad-spectrum chemokine antagonist vMIP-II, whereas MCV encodes a highly selective CCR8 antagonist, MC148, conceivably to interfere with monocyte invasion and dendritic cell function. Because of its pharmacological selectivity, the MC148 protein could be a useful tool in the delineation of the role played by CCR8 and its endogenous ligand, I-309.

synaptic - like microves	SLMVs	Cholesterol binds to synaptophysin and is required for biogenesis of synaptic vesicles. Here, to study lipid-protein interactions that contribute to the biogenesis of regulated secretory vesicles, we have developed new approaches by which to label proteins in vivo, using photoactivatable cholesterol and glycerophospholipids. We identify synaptophysin as a major specifically cholesterol-binding protein in PC12 cells and brain synaptic vesicles. Limited cholesterol depletion, which has little effect on total endocytic activity, blocks the biogenesis of synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) from the plasma membrane. We propose that specific interactions between cholesterol and SLMV membrane proteins, such as synaptophysin, contribute to both the segregation of SLMV membrane constituents from plasma-membrane constituents, and the induction of synaptic-vesicle curvature.
peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor	PPARgamma	Dominant negative mutations in human PPARgamma associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Thiazolidinediones are a new class of antidiabetic agent that improve insulin sensitivity and reduce plasma glucose and blood pressure in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Although these agents can bind and activate an orphan nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), there is no direct evidence to conclusively implicate this receptor in the regulation of mammalian glucose homeostasis. Here we report two different heterozygous mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma in three subjects with severe insulin resistance. In the PPARgamma crystal structure, the mutations destabilize helix 12 which mediates transactivation. Consistent with this, both receptor mutants are markedly transcriptionally impaired and, moreover, are able to inhibit the action of coexpressed wild-type PPARgamma in a dominant negative manner. In addition to insulin resistance, all three subjects developed type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension at an unusually early age. Our findings represent the first germline loss-of-function mutations in PPARgamma and provide compelling genetic evidence that this receptor is important in the control of insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis and blood pressure in man.
protein interacting with c kinase	PICK1	Interaction of the PDZ domain of human PICK1 with class I ADP-ribosylation factors. We have cloned the cDNA encoding human PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1), a PDZ domain-containing protein of 415 amino acids, and also identified the Drosophila homologue by search of the databank. Northern blot analysis shows a single mRNA of about 2.0 kb ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Although PICK1 proteins harbor a region homologous to arfaptin1 and arfaptin2, two proteins that bind to the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor), this region of PICK1 does not interact with ARFs in the yeast two-hybrid system. On the other hand, the PDZ domain of PICK1 is capable of interacting with constitutively active, GTP-bound forms of ARF1 and ARF3, but neither with those of ARF5/6 nor with the GDP-bound ARFs. The PICK1-ARF interaction is abrogated by introduction of mutations in the PDZ domain or by deletion of the extreme C-terminus of ARF1. Thus, PICK1 specifically interacts with ARF1/3 in the GTP-bound state, suggesting that PICK1 participates in ARF1/3-mediated cellular processes.

drosophila neurexin	Nrx-IV	Caspr2, a new member of the neurexin superfamily, is localized at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons and associates with K+ channels. Rapid conduction in myelinated axons depends on the generation of specialized subcellular domains to which different sets of ion channels are localized. Here, we describe the identification of Caspr2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Neurexin IV (Nrx-IV), and show that this neurexin-like protein and the closely related molecule Caspr/Paranodin demarcate distinct subdomains in myelinated axons. While contactin-associated protein (Caspr) is present at the paranodal junctions, Caspr2 is precisely colocalized with Shaker-like K+ channels in the juxtaparanodal region. We further show that Caspr2 specifically associates with Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and their Kvbeta2 subunit. This association involves the C-terminal sequence of Caspr2, which contains a putative PDZ binding site. These results suggest a role for Caspr family members in the local differentiation of the axon into distinct functional subdomains.

iroquois homeobox gene	Irx4	Cardiac expression of the ventricle-specific homeobox gene Irx4 is modulated by Nkx2-5 and dHand. We report the isolation and characterization of the cDNAs encoded by the murine and human homeobox genes, Irx4 (Iroquois homeobox gene 4). Mouse and human Irx4 proteins are highly conserved (83%) and their 63-aa homeodomain is more than 93% identical to that of the Drosophila Iroquois patterning genes. Human IRX4 maps to chromosome 5p15.3, which is syntenic to murine chromosome 13. Irx4 transcripts are present in the developing central nervous system, skin, and vibrissae, but are predominantly expressed in the cardiac ventricles. In mice at embryonic day (E) 7.5, Irx4 transcripts are found in the chorion and at low levels in a discrete anterior domain of the cardiac primordia. During the formation of the linear heart tube and its subsequent looping (E8.0-8.5), Irx4 expression is restricted to the ventricular segment and is absent from both the posterior (eventual atrial) and the anterior (eventual outflow tract) segments of the heart. Throughout all subsequent stages in which the chambers of the heart become morphologically distinct (E8.5-11) and into adulthood, cardiac Irx4 expression is found exclusively in the ventricular myocardium. Irx4 gene expression was also assessed in embryos with aberrant cardiac development: mice lacking RXRalpha or MEF2c have normal Irx4 expression, but mice lacking the homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-5 (Csx) have markedly reduced levels of Irx4 transcripts. dHand-null embryos initiate Irx4 expression, but cannot maintain normal levels. These data indicate that the homeobox gene Irx4 is likely to be an important mediator of ventricular differentiation during cardiac development, which is downstream of Nkx2-5 and dHand.
interleukin -	IL-1	Four new members expand the interleukin-1 superfamily. We report here the cloning and characterization of four new members of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family (FIL1delta, FIL1epsilon, FIL1zeta, and FIL1eta, with FIL1 standing for " Family of IL-1 " ). The novel genes demonstrate significant sequence similarity to IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1ra, and IL-18, and in addition maintain a conserved exon-intron arrangement that is shared with the previously known members of the family. Protein structure modeling also suggests that the FIL1 genes are related to IL-1beta and IL-1ra. The novel genes form a cluster with the IL-1s on the long arm of human chromosome 2.
prostate - specific	PSA	PDEF, a novel prostate epithelium-specific ets transcription factor, interacts with the androgen receptor and activates prostate-specific antigen gene expression. Prostate cancer, the most frequent solid cancer in older men, is a leading cause of cancer deaths. Although proliferation and differentiation of normal prostate epithelia and the initial growth of prostate cancer cells are androgen-dependent, prostate cancers ultimately become androgen-independent and refractory to hormone therapy. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene has been widely used as a diagnostic indicator for androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer. Androgen-induced and prostate epithelium-specific PSA expression is regulated by a proximal promoter and an upstream enhancer via several androgen receptor binding sites. However, little progress has been made in identifying androgen-independent regulatory elements involved in PSA gene regulation. We report the isolation of a novel, prostate epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor, PDEF (prostate-derived Ets factor), that among the Ets family uniquely prefers binding to a GGAT rather than a GGAA core. PDEF acts as an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the PSA promoter. PDEF also directly interacts with the DNA binding domain of androgen receptor and enhances androgen-mediated activation of the PSA promoter. Our results, as well as the critical roles of other Ets factors in cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis, strongly suggest that PDEF is an important regulator of prostate gland and/or prostate cancer development.

hermansky - pudlak	HPS	Molecular characterization of the protein encoded by the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 gene. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) comprises a group of genetic disorders characterized by defective lysosome-related organelles. The most common form of HPS (HPS type 1) is caused by mutations in a gene encoding a protein with no homology to any other known protein. Here we report the identification and biochemical characterization of this gene product, termed HPS1p. Endogenous HPS1p was detected in a wide variety of human cell lines and exhibited an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a protein of approximately 80 kDa. In contrast to previous theoretical analysis predicting that HPS1p is an integral membrane protein, we found that this protein was predominantly cytosolic, with a small amount being peripherally associated with membranes. The sedimentation coefficient of the soluble form of HPS1p was approximately 6 S as inferred from ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients. HPS1p-deficient cells derived from patients with HPS type 1 displayed normal distribution and trafficking of the lysosomal membrane proteins, CD63 and Lamp-1. This was in contrast to cells from HPS type 2 patients, having mutations in the beta3A subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, which exhibited increased routing of these lysosomal proteins through the plasma membrane. Similar analyses performed on fibroblasts from 10 different mouse models of HPS revealed that only the AP-3 mutants pearl and mocha display increased trafficking of Lamp-1 through the plasma membrane. Taken together, these observations suggest that the product of the HPS1 gene is a cytosolic protein capable of associating with membranes and involved in the biogenesis and/or function of lysosome-related organelles by a mechanism distinct from that dependent on the AP-3 complex.
cancer / testis - associated protein of 11 k	CTp11	CTp11, a novel member of the family of human cancer/testis antigens. To identify new genes that may contribute to the metastatic pathway of neoplastic cells, we compared mRNA expression of the parental human melanoma cell line 1F6 and its metastatic variant 1F6m using mRNA differential display. We isolated a cDNA clone that was exclusively expressed in 1F6m. Northern blot analysis on a broader panel of human melanoma cell lines with different metastatic capacity following s.c. inoculation into nude mice demonstrated that the gene was expressed only in the most aggressive, highly metastatic cell lines, giving a band of 0.5 kb. The isolated full length cDNA clone showed an open reading frame of 97 amino acids. To study the subcellular localization of the gene product, COS-1 cells were transfected with cDNA of the gene fused to eGFP. We found the fusion protein to be exclusively present in the nucleus. A computer search showed strong homology with human genomic clones all localized on chromosome X (Xq26.3-Xq27.1) and with several expressed sequence tags, all from testis. Localization of the gene on chromosome X was confirmed by genomic PCR on a panel of human chromosome-specific rodent/human hybrid cell lines. Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR on 17 different normal human tissue samples showed that the gene was only expressed in normal testis. Reverse transcription-PCR on a great number of different human tumor cell lines showed expression in 25-30% of the melanoma and bladder carcinoma cell lines. Only 2 of 29 other tumor cell lines were positive. Nested PCR analysis of a series of fresh human melanocytic tumors demonstrated expression in 7 of 10 melanomas tested. No expression was seen in benign melanocytic tumors. In addition to melanoma, some malignant tumors from other histological types were also found to be positive. Based on these data, we conclude that the described gene, CTp11 (cancer/testis-associated protein of 11 kDa), is a novel member of the family of cancer/testis antigens.
major histocompatibility	MHC	The impact of the non-classical MHC proteins HLA-DM and HLA-DO on loading of MHC class II molecules. Peptide binding to classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules is known to be determined by the properties of the class II peptide binding groove but recently it turned out to be co-controlled by the activity of the non-classical MHC molecules HLA-DM and HLA-DO: HLA-DM functions as a mediator of peptide exchange. In addition, HLA-DM is a chaperone for MHC class II molecules in endosomal and lysosomal loading compartments because it stabilizes the empty MHC class II peptide binding groove and keeps it receptive for peptide loading until appropriate peptide ligands are captured. Since HLA-DM favors the generation of high-stability peptide-MHC class II complexes by releasing low-stability peptide ligands, DM activity affects the peptide repertoire presented on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells. HLA-DO is expressed mainly in B cells and binds tightly to HLA-DM thereby modulating its activity. Together, HLA-DM and HLA-DO are critical factors in shaping the MHC class II-associated self or foreign peptide repertoire of antigen presenting cells and, hence, govern initiation or prevention of an immune response.
major histocompatibility	MHC	Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

two - tissue suppression subtractive hybrid	SSH	Discovery of a putative heme-binding protein family (SOUL/HBP) by two-tissue suppression subtractive hybridization and database searches. In the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus, the retina and pineal gland contain circadian clocks that are directly entrained by environmental light-dark cycles. To identify novel genes that are expressed in the retina and pineal gland, we performed two-tissue suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Two-tissue SSH is designed to identify genes expressed in common between two RNA samples while at the same time subtracting out abundant transcripts. Using this method, we identified a novel chicken gene, named ckSoul, that is strongly expressed in the retina and pineal gland. The protein product of ckSoul is similar to a novel heme-binding protein (p22 HBP) and to an uncharacterized mammalian gene in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The mouse transcript of this new gene is expressed in the retina and may represent the mammalian ortholog of ckSoul. Molecular analysis of the mammalian and chicken proteins suggests SOUL and HBP are members of a new family of heme-binding proteins.

cc chemokine ligand	CCL25	CCR9A and CCR9B: two receptors for the chemokine CCL25/TECK/Ck beta-15 that differ in their sensitivities to ligand. We isolated cDNAs for a chemokine receptor-related protein having the database designation GPR-9-6. Two classes of cDNAs were identified from mRNAs that arose by alternative splicing and that encode receptors that we refer to as CCR9A and CCR9B. CCR9A is predicted to contain 12 additional amino acids at its N terminus as compared with CCR9B. Cells transfected with cDNAs for CCR9A and CCR9B responded to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25)/thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK)/chemokine beta-15 (CK beta-15) in assays for both calcium flux and chemotaxis. No other chemokines tested produced responses specific for the cDNA-transfected cells. mRNA for CCR9A/B is expressed predominantly in the thymus, coincident with the expression of CCL25, and highest expression for CCR9A/B among thymocyte subsets was found in CD4+CD8+ cells. mRNAs encoding the A and B forms of the receptor were expressed at a ratio of approximately 10:1 in immortalized T cell lines, in PBMC, and in diverse populations of thymocytes. The EC50 of CCL25 for CCR9A was lower than that for CCR9B, and CCR9A was desensitized by doses of CCL25 that failed to silence CCR9B. CCR9 is the first example of a chemokine receptor in which alternative mRNA splicing leads to proteins of differing activities, providing a mechanism for extending the range of concentrations over which a cell can respond to increments in the concentration of ligand. The study of CCR9A and CCR9B should enhance our understanding of the role of the chemokine system in T cell biology, particularly during the stages of thymocyte development.

programmed cell death	PDCD9	Cloning, expression, and mapping of PDCD9, the human homolog of Gallus gallus pro-apoptotic protein p52. We report the sequence, tissue distribution, and chromosome location of a novel gene, PDCD9 (programmed cell death 9). PDCD9 is the mammalian counterpart of the Gallus gallus pro-apoptotic protein p52. The human cDNA has an open reading frame of 1,314 nucleotides and was predicted to encode a protein of 438 amino acids with a calculated mass of 50 kDa. The protein sequences of chicken, mouse, and human PDCD9 are remarkably conserved. PDCD9 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues, displaying a stronger signal in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. PDCD9 was mapped to chromosome 5q11.
x - linked deafness type	DFN3	A novel ribosomal S6-kinase (RSK4; RPS6KA6) is commonly deleted in patients with complex X-linked mental retardation. Large deletions in Xq21 often are associated with contiguous gene syndromes consisting of X-linked deafness type 3 (DFN3), mental retardation (MRX), and choroideremia (CHM). The identification of deletions associated with classic CHM or DFN3 facilitated the positional cloning of the underlying genes, REP-1 and POU3F4, respectively, and enabled the positioning of the MRX gene in between these genes. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, ribosomal S6-kinase 4 (RSK4; HGMW-approved symbol RPS6KA6), which maps in the MRX critical region. RSK4 is completely deleted in eight patients with the contiguous gene syndrome including MRX, partially deleted in a patient with DFN3 and present in patients with an Xq21 deletion and normal intellectual abilities. RSK4 is most abundantly expressed in brain and kidney. The predicted protein of 746 amino acids shows a high level of homology to three previously isolated members of the human RSK family. RSK2 is involved in Coffin-Lowry syndrome and nonspecific MRX. The localization of RSK4 in the interval that is commonly deleted in mentally retarded males together with the high degree of amino acid identity with RSK2 suggests that RSK4 plays a role in normal neuronal development. Further mutation analyses in males with X-linked mental retardation must prove that RSK4 is indeed a novel MRX gene.

The identification of deletions associated with classic CHM or DFN3 facilitated the positional cloning of the underlying genes, REP-1 and POU3F4, respectively, and enabled the positioning of the MRX gene in between these genes. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, ribosomal S6-kinase 4 (RSK4; HGMW-approved symbol RPS6KA6), which maps in the MRX critical region. RSK4 is completely deleted in eight patients with the contiguous gene syndrome including MRX, partially deleted in a patient with DFN3 and present in patients with an Xq21 deletion and normal intellectual abilities. RSK4 is most abundantly expressed in brain and kidney. The predicted protein of 746 amino acids shows a high level of homology to three previously isolated members of the human RSK family. RSK2 is involved in Coffin-Lowry syndrome and nonspecific MRX. The localization of RSK4 in the interval that is commonly deleted in mentally retarded males together with the high degree of amino acid identity with RSK2 suggests that RSK4 plays a role in normal neuronal development. Further mutation analyses in males with X-linked mental retardation must prove that RSK4 is indeed a novel MRX gene.
ubiquitin protease	UBP	USP25, a novel gene encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme, is located in the gene-poor region 21q11.2. We have identified a new gene, USP25, spanning over 150 kb at 21q11. 2, one of the lowest gene-density regions of the human genome. USP25 is made up of 25 exons and encodes a 1087-aa protein. Database comparisons reveal high homology with members of the ubiquitin protease family (UBP). Basal expression was observed in all human tissues tested, and two main transcripts were identified. The homologous murine gene has also been characterized. In situ hybridization in mouse embryonic brains showed a clear correlation of expression with proliferative neuroepithelial cells and postmitotic neurons. Moreover, high expression was observed in adult mouse testis. UBPs belong to a complex family of deubiquitinating enzymes that specifically cleave ubiquitin conjugates on a great variety of substrates. These enzymes have an essential role in protein degradation via the 26S proteasome and thus regulate many cellular pathways. An increase in USP25 gene dosage in Down syndrome patients could seriously disturb the balance between ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated substrates.
protein tyrosine phosphatase	PTPs	Molecular cloning, chromosomal mapping, and developmental expression of a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase-like gene. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) mediate the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine. PTPs are known to be involved in many signal transduction pathways leading to cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. We have cloned a new family of novel protein tyrosine phosphatase-like genes, the Ptpl (protein tyrosine phosphatase-like; proline instead of catalytic arginine) gene family. This gene family is composed of at least three members, and we describe here the developmental expression pattern and chromosomal location for one of these genes, Ptpla. In situ hybridization studies revealed that Ptpla expression was first detected at embryonic day 8.5 in muscle progenitors and later in differentiated muscle types: in the developing heart, throughout the liver and lungs, and in a number of neural crest derivatives including the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Postnatally Ptpla was expressed in a number of adult tissues including cardiac and skeletal muscle, liver, testis, and kidney. The early expression pattern of this gene and its persistent expression in adult tissues suggest that it may have an important role in the development, differentiation, and maintenance of a number of different tissue types. The human homologue of Ptpla (PTPLA) was cloned and shown to map to 10p13-p14.

sh3 - domain binding protein	SH3BP4	Cloning, chromosomal localization, and characterization of cDNA from a novel gene, SH3BP4, expressed by human corneal fibroblasts. The cornea contains, as a major element, a transparent stroma produced and maintained by keratocytes (fibroblasts). Through molecular biology studies using cultured human corneal fibroblasts, a cDNA that was shown to be novel was isolated and sequenced. This novel gene product, named SH3-domain binding protein 4 (SH3BP4), contains a 5.6-kb message that is present in normal human corneal fibroblasts and all tissues examined, with higher levels in pancreas, placenta, heart, and kidney. SH3BP4 was localized by FISH analysis to human chromosome 2q37.1-q37.2 near the telomere. The deduced sequence for SH3BP4 was found to contain a 963-amino-acid open reading frame that has homology to a 479-amino-acid protein in GenBank called EH-binding protein. Although the entire sequence of EH-binding protein aligns with SH3BP4, the alignment is not complete or contiguous. Therefore, SH3BP4 has an additional 73 amino acids at the N-terminus and an additional 411 amino acids near the C-terminus that are not present in EH-binding protein. Consensus sequence domains identified in SH3BP4 include a SH3 domain, three N-P-F motifs, a P-X-X-P motif noted for binding to SH3 domains, a bipartite nuclear targeting signal, and a tyrosine phosphorylation site. SH3BP4 homologies and consensus sequence sites indicate that it may be involved in a newly identified cascade of proteins involved in endocytosis, intracellular sorting, and the cell cycle.
adp - ribosyltransferase	Adprt	Identification of a novel gene (ADPRTL1) encoding a potential Poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase protein. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins plays a significant role in the maintenance of genomic DNA stability. To date, four poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating proteins have been identified in humans. We now report the full-length sequence, expression profile, and chromosomal localization of a novel gene, ADPRTL1, encoding an ADP-ribosyltransferase-like protein. The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 1724 amino acids with a molecular mass of 192.8 kDa. The protein contains a region showing homology to the catalytic domains of the nuclear-localized ADP-ribosyltransferase proteins (Adprt), two recently identified Adprt-like proteins (Adprtl2 and Adprtl3), and the telomere-associated protein tankyrase. Key amino acids known to be important for the activity of these enzymes are conserved within this region of the Adprtl1 protein, indicating that Adprtl1 is a functional poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase. As has been noted for tankyrase, sequence analysis of the Adprtl1 protein suggests that it is not capable of binding DNA directly. Thus, the transferase activity of Adprtl1 may be activated by other factors such as protein-protein interaction mediated by the extensive carboxyl terminus. We have subsequently refined the location of the ADPRTL1 genomic locus to 13q11, close to the recently cloned ZNF198 gene.
protocadherin	Pcdhs	Identification of a novel protocadherin gene (PCDH11) on the human XY homology region in Xq21.3. Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are members of the rapidly growing cadherin superfamily and are thought to be involved in cell-cell recognition in the central nervous system. Using human BH-Pcdh cDNA, we retrieved a homologous gene from the database. The new gene (Pcdh-X, HGMW-approved symbol PCDH11) was present on a genomic clone of human chromosome X (clone bWXD306), between two sequence tagged sites, sWXD1362 and 221. Pcdh-X therefore maps to the XY homology region in Xq21.3. The open reading frame consists of 1021 amino acids (aa) including seven cadherin repeats (EC1-7) in the extracellular domain. The Pcdh-X gene consists of at least three exons; the first exon encodes the 5'-untranslated region, EC1, and half of EC2, the second exon encodes the remainder of the Pcdh-Xa, and the third exon encodes the cytoplasmic tail of Pcdh-Xb and its 3'-untranslated region. The second exon has an alternative splice site that is used to produce two isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails of 10 (Pcdh-Xa) or 14 amino acids (Pcdh-Xb). Northern blot analysis revealed an approximately 6.0-kb transcript expressed in human and mouse fetal brain.

methionine adenosyltransfera	MAT	Cloning, expression, and functional characterization of the beta regulatory subunit of human methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT II). MAT II, the extrahepatic form of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), consists of catalytic alpha(2)/alpha(2') subunits and a noncatalytic beta subunit, believed to have a regulatory function. The full-length cDNA that encodes the beta subunit of human MAT II was cloned and found to encode for a 334-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 37,552. Analysis of sequence homology showed similarity with bacterial enzymes that catalyze the reduction of TDP-linked sugars. The beta subunit cDNA was cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector, and the recombinant His tagged protein, which was expressed in Escherichia coli, was recognized by antibodies to the human MAT II, to synthetic peptides copying the sequence of native beta subunit protein, and to the rbeta protein. There is no cross-reactivity between the MAT II alpha(2) or beta subunits. None of the anti-beta subunit antibodies reacted with protein extracts of E. coli host cells, suggesting that these bacteria have no beta subunit protein. Interestingly, the rbeta subunit associated with E. coli as well as human MAT alpha subunits. This association changed the kinetic properties of both enzymes and lowered the K(m) of MAT for L-methionine. Together, the data show that we have cloned and expressed the human MAT II beta subunit and confirmed its long suspected regulatory function. This knowledge affords a molecular means by which MAT activity and consequently the levels of AdoMet may be modulated in mammalian cells.
tumor necrosis factor -	TNF-alpha	Identification of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible gene, SCC-S2, containing the consensus sequence of a death effector domain of fas-associated death domain-like interleukin- 1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein. We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-inducible gene, SCC-S2. Based on the nucleotide sequence, the SCC-S2 open reading frame contains a sequence in the amino terminus that shows a significant homology to death effector domain II of cell death regulatory protein, Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (FLIP). Unlike FLIP, the SCC-S2 open reading frame contains only one death effector domain and lacks the carboxyl-terminal caspase-like homology domain, raising the possibility that SCC-S2 may be a novel member of the FLIP family. SCC-S2 mRNA expression is found in most normal tissues and malignant cells. The steady state level of SCC-S2 mRNA is significantly induced by TNF-alpha in different tumor cells (TNF-alpha at 20 ng/ml for 3 h: A549, approximately 2-9-fold; SKOV-3, approximately 3-fold; PCI-04A, approximately 3-6-fold). TNF-alpha treatment (100 ng/ml, 4 h) of HeLa cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged SCC-S2 cDNA or expression vector alone led to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells as compared with the untreated counterpart. Interestingly, however, SCC-S2 transfectants revealed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells as compared with the vector transfectants (p < 0.001). These data implicate a role of SCC-S2 as a negative mediator of apoptosis in certain cell types.

tubulointerstitial nephritis	TIN-ag	Molecular cloning, expression, and chromosomal localization of a human tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen. Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag) is an extracellular matrix basement protein which was originally identified as a target antigen involved in anti-tubular basement membrane (TBM) antibody-mediated interstitial nephritis (TIN). Further investigations elucidated that TIN-ag plays a role in renal tubulogenesis and that TIN-ag is defected in hereditary tubulointerstitial disorder such as juvenile nephronophthisis. We previously isolated and characterized 54 kDa glycoprotein as TIN-ag. cDNA encoding rabbit and mouse TIN-ag has recently been identified. In the present study, the cDNA of the human homologue of TIN-ag was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined (Accession No. AB022277; the DDBJ nucleotide sequence database). Deduced amino acid sequence (476 aa) exhibited the presence of a signal peptide (1-18 aa), cysteine residues termed follistatin module, six potential glycosylation sites, and an ATP/GTP-binding site. Homology search revealed approximately 85% homology with both rabbit and mouse TIN-ag, and also some ( approximately 40%) similarity with C. elegans. Human TIN-ag contained a sequence similar to several classes of extracellular matrix molecules in amino terminal region and to cathepsin family of cysteine proteinases in the carboxyl terminal region. Northern blot analysis revealed exclusive expression of this molecule in human adult and fetal kidney tissues. Using a monoclonal antibody recognizing human TIN-ag, protein expression ( approximately 50 kDa) was identified in cultured COS-1 cells transfected with human TIN-ag cDNA. The human TIN-ag was mapped to chromosome 6p11.2-12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results may provide further evidence for understanding TIN-ag molecule and clues for gene analysis of juvenile nephronophthisis.

adp - ribosylation	ARFs	Similarities in function and gene structure of cytohesin-4 and cytohesin-1, guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins for ADP-ribosylation factors. Activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), approximately 20-kDa GTPases that are inactive in the GDP-bound form, depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs) to accelerate GTP binding. A novel ARF GEP, designated cytohesin-4, was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. Deduced amino acid sequence of the 47-kDa protein contains the same structural components present in cytohesin -1, -2, and -3, including an approximately 200-amino acid Sec7 domain with an approximately 100-residue pleckstrin homology domain near the C terminus. The Sec7 domain sequence is 77% identical to those of other cytohesins. Structures of the cytohesin-4 and cytohesin-1 genes were remarkably similar, except for an extra 3-base pair (GAG) exon present in cytohesin-1. Two mRNAs with and without the 3-base pair sequence were found in brain in different ratios for cytohesin-1, -2, and -3 but not cytohesin-4. Recombinant cytohesin-4 stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding by human ARF1 and ARF5 but not ARF6. Like other cytohesins and unlike the approximately 200-kDa ARF GEPs, it was not inhibited by brefeldin A. A cytohesin-4 mRNA of approximately 3.7 kilobases, abundant in leukocytes, was not detected in most tissues. Among separated populations of blood cells, approximately 90% of CD33(+) (monocytes), 80% of CD2(+) (NK/T), and 10-20% of CD19(+) (B) cells contained cytohesin-4 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Thus, in gene structure and brefeldin A-insensitive GEP activity, cytohesin-4 resembles other cytohesins, but its tissue distribution differs considerably, consistent with a different specific function.

Thus, in gene structure and brefeldin A-insensitive GEP activity, cytohesin-4 resembles other cytohesins, but its tissue distribution differs considerably, consistent with a different specific function.
nuclear factor kappa	NF-kappaB	A subclass of Ras proteins that regulate the degradation of IkappaB. Small guanosine triphosphatases, typified by the mammalian Ras proteins, play major roles in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways. A subclass of evolutionarily conserved Ras-like proteins was identified, members of which differ from other Ras proteins in containing amino acids at positions 12 and 61 that are similar to those present in the oncogenic forms of Ras. These proteins, kappaB-Ras1 and kappaB-Ras2, interact with the PEST domains of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta [inhibitors of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)] and decrease their rate of degradation. In cells, kappaB-Ras proteins are associated only with NF-kappaB:IkappaBbeta complexes and therefore may provide an explanation for the slower rate of degradation of IkappaBbeta compared with IkappaBalpha.
cc chemokine receptor	CCR1	Selective binding of the truncated form of the chemokine CKbeta8 (25-99) to CC chemokine receptor 1(CCR1). Human CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) has been proposed as a receptor for CKbeta8. To obtain conclusive evidence, binding-displacement studies of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) were performed on membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human CCR1. The Ic50 for displacement of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) with CKbeta8 (25-99) was 0.22 nM. The longer forms of CKbeta8 (24-99 and 1-99) also displaced 125I-CKbeta8, with Ic50 values of 6.5 and 16 nM, respectively. Displacement profiles of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) on freshly prepared human monocytes indicated that CCR1 was the major receptor for CKbeta8. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor for different-length CKbeta8 and that CKbeta8 (25-99) has a similar affinity for CCR1 as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). The longer variants of CKbeta8 are significantly less potent than CKbeta8 (25-99) and MIP-1a on CCR1 and monocytes (P < 0.05).

endoplasmic retic	ER	Retention of subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be localized to this organelle by mechanisms that involve retention, retrieval, or a combination of both. For luminal ER proteins, which contain a KDEL domain, and for type I transmembrane proteins carrying a dilysine motif, specific retrieval mechanisms have been identified. However, most ER membrane proteins do not contain easily identifiable retrieval motifs. ER localization information has been found in cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or luminal domains. In this study, we have identified ER localization domains within the three type I transmembrane proteins, ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. Together with DAD1, these membrane proteins form an oligomeric complex that has oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) activity. We have previously shown that ER retention information is independently contained within the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of RII, and in the case of RI, a truncated form consisting of the luminal domain was retained in the ER. To determine whether other domains of RI carry additional retention information, we have generated chimeras by exchanging individual domains of the Tac antigen with the corresponding ones of RI. We demonstrate here that only the luminal domain of RI contains ER retention information. We also show that the dilysine motif in OST48 functions as an ER localization motif because OST48 in which the two lysine residues are replaced by serine (OST48ss) is no longer retained in the ER and is found instead also at the plasma membrane. OST48ss is, however, retained in the ER when coexpressed with RI, RII, or chimeras, which by themselves do not exit from the ER, indicating that they may form partial oligomeric complexes by interacting with the luminal domain of OST48. In the case of the Tac chimera containing only the luminal domain of RII, which by itself exits from the ER and is rapidly degraded, it is retained in the ER and becomes stabilized when coexpressed with OST48.

In this study, we have identified ER localization domains within the three type I transmembrane proteins, ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. Together with DAD1, these membrane proteins form an oligomeric complex that has oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) activity. We have previously shown that ER retention information is independently contained within the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of RII, and in the case of RI, a truncated form consisting of the luminal domain was retained in the ER. To determine whether other domains of RI carry additional retention information, we have generated chimeras by exchanging individual domains of the Tac antigen with the corresponding ones of RI. We demonstrate here that only the luminal domain of RI contains ER retention information. We also show that the dilysine motif in OST48 functions as an ER localization motif because OST48 in which the two lysine residues are replaced by serine (OST48ss) is no longer retained in the ER and is found instead also at the plasma membrane. OST48ss is, however, retained in the ER when coexpressed with RI, RII, or chimeras, which by themselves do not exit from the ER, indicating that they may form partial oligomeric complexes by interacting with the luminal domain of OST48. In the case of the Tac chimera containing only the luminal domain of RII, which by itself exits from the ER and is rapidly degraded, it is retained in the ER and becomes stabilized when coexpressed with OST48.
peripheral nervous	PNS	Identification of the Nogo inhibitor of axon regeneration as a Reticulon protein. Adult mammalian axon regeneration is generally successful in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) but is dismally poor in the central nervous system (CNS). However, many classes of CNS axons can extend for long distances in peripheral nerve grafts. A comparison of myelin from the CNS and the PNS has revealed that CNS white matter is selectively inhibitory for axonal outgrowth. Several components of CNS white matter, NI35, NI250(Nogo) and MAG, that have inhibitory activity for axon extension have been described. The IN-1 antibody, which recognizes NI35 and NI250(Nogo), allows moderate degrees of axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Here we identify Nogo as a member of the Reticulon family, Reticulon 4-A. Nogo is expressed by oligodendrocytes but not by Schwann cells, and associates primarily with the endoplasmic reticulum. A 66-residue lumenal/extracellular domain inhibits axonal extension and collapses dorsal root ganglion growth cones. In contrast to Nogo, Reticulon 1 and 3 are not expressed by oligodendrocytes, and the 66-residue lumenal/extracellular domains from Reticulon 1, 2 and 3 do not inhibit axonal regeneration. These data provide a molecular basis to assess the contribution of Nogo to the failure of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS.

neurofibromatosis type	NF2	Cloning and characterization of SCHIP-1, a novel protein interacting specifically with spliced isoforms and naturally occurring mutant NF2 proteins. The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) protein, known as schwannomin or merlin, is a tumor suppressor involved in NF2-associated and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. It is closely related to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family members, implicated in linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanism allowing schwannomin to function as a tumor suppressor is unknown. In attempt to shed light on schwannomin function, we have identified a novel coiled-coil protein, SCHIP-1, that specifically associates with schwannomin in vitro and in vivo. Within its coiled-coil region, this protein is homologous to human FEZ proteins and the related Caenorhabditis elegans gene product UNC-76. Immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected cells shows a partial colocalization of SCHIP-1 and schwannomin, beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. Surprisingly, immunoprecipitation assays reveal that in a cellular context, association with SCHIP-1 can be observed only with some naturally occurring mutants of schwannomin, or a schwannomin spliced isoform lacking exons 2 and 3, but not with the schwannomin isoform exhibiting growth-suppressive activity. Our observations suggest that SCHIP-1 interaction with schwannomin is regulated by conformational changes in schwannomin, possibly induced by posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, or mutations.
killer cell lectin - like receptor , subfamily f , member	KLRF1	Human KLRF1, a novel member of the killer cell lectin-like receptor gene family: molecular characterization, genomic structure, physical mapping to the NK gene complex and expression analysis. The human NK gene complex localized on chromosome 12p12.3 - p13.2 codes for several lectin-like receptor genes expressed by NK cells as well as by other hematopoietic cells. In this study, by using the expressed sequence tag database we identified a novel receptor gene, designated as killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily F, member 1 (KLRF1), encoding a putative type II transmembrane glycoprotein. The KLRF1 gene has been localized on the high-resolution physical map of chromosome 12p. The genomic structure of the KLRF1 gene and the existence of one spliced variant are also described. KLRF1 was expressed at the mRNA level in peripheral blood leukocytes, activated NK cells, monocytes and NK and myeloid cell lines. The presence of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of KLRF1 suggests an inhibitory role in NK cell and monocyte activity.
transmembrane	TM	GLUTX1, a novel mammalian glucose transporter expressed in the central nervous system and insulin-sensitive tissues. Based on homology with GLUT1-5, we have isolated a cDNA for a novel glucose transporter, GLUTX1. This cDNA encodes a protein of 478 amino acids that shows between 29 and 32% identity with rat GLUT1-5 and 32-36% identity with plant and bacterial hexose transporters. Unlike GLUT1-5, GLUTX1 has a short extracellular loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 1 and TM2 and a long extracellular loop between TM9 and TM10 that contains the only N-glycosylation site. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, GLUTX1 showed strong transport activity only after suppression of a dileucine internalization motif present in the amino-terminal region. Transport activity was inhibited by cytochalasin B and partly competed by D-fructose and D-galactose. The Michaelis-Menten constant for glucose was approximately 2 mM. When translated in reticulocytes lysates, GLUTX1 migrates as a 35-kDa protein that becomes glycosylated in the presence of microsomal membranes. Western blot analysis of GLUTX1 transiently expressed in HEK293T cells revealed a diffuse band with a molecular mass of 37-50 kDa that could be converted to a approximately 35-kDa polypeptide following enzymatic deglycosylation. Immunofluorescence microscopy detection of GLUTX1 transfected into HEK293T cells showed an intracellular staining. Mutation of the dileucine internalization motif induced expression of GLUTX1 at the cell surface. GLUTX1 mRNA was detected in testis, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and adrenal gland. We hypothesize that, in a similar fashion to GLUT4, in vivo cell surface expression of GLUTX1 may be inducible by a hormonal or other stimulus.
phosphatidylinosit	PI	Differential regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and p70 S6 kinase pathways by the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor in rat-1 fibroblasts. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt are thought to be signaling intermediates that link cell surface receptors to p70 S6 kinase. We examined the effect of a G(q)-coupled receptor on PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling and p70 S6 kinase activation using Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing the human alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor. Treatment of the cells with phenylephrine, a specific alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist, activated p70 S6 kinase but did not activate PI 3-kinase or any of the three known isoforms of Akt. Furthermore, phenylephrine blocked the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and the phosphorylation and activation of Akt-1. The effect of phenylephrine was not confined to signaling pathways that include insulin receptor substrate-1, as the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist also inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt-1. Although increasing the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration with the ionophore A23187 inhibited the activation of Akt-1 by IGF-I, Ca(2+) does not appear to play a role in the phenylephrine-mediated inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The differential ability of phenylephrine and IGF-I to activate Akt-1 resulted in a differential ability to protect cells from UV-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that activation of p70 S6 kinase by the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor in Rat-1 fibroblasts occurs in the absence of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling. Furthermore, this receptor negatively regulates the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, resulting in enhanced cell death following apoptotic insult.

endoplasmic retic	ER	ERO1-L, a human protein that favors disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidizing conditions must be maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to allow the formation of disulfide bonds in secretory proteins. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a mammalian gene (ERO1-L) that shares extensive homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERO1 gene, required in yeast for oxidative protein folding. When expressed in mammalian cells, the product of the human ERO1-L gene co-localizes with ER markers and displays Endo-H-sensitive glycans. In isolated microsomes, ERO1-L behaves as a type II integral membrane protein. ERO1-L is able to complement several phenotypic traits of the yeast thermosensitive mutant ero1-1, including temperature and dithiothreitol sensitivity, and intrachain disulfide bond formation in carboxypeptidase Y. ERO1-L is no longer functional when either one of the highly conserved Cys-394 or Cys-397 is mutated. These results strongly suggest that ERO1-L is involved in oxidative ER protein folding in mammalian cells.
None	HSD	Close kinship of human 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene with three aldo-keto reductase genes. BACKGROUND: 20alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and catalyses the reaction of progesterone to the inactive form 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Progesterone plays an important role in the maintenance of pregnancy, and, in rodents, plasma progesterone levels decrease abruptly just before parturition. The induction of 20alpha-HSD is thought to be responsible for the decrease in plasma progesterone at term. High homology between human 20alpha-HSD [AKR 1C1] cDNA with other AKRs had caused difficulty in gene isolation and expression analysis. Thus, the metabolism of progesterone in the human reproductive system remained unclear. RESULTS: By hybridization with rat 20alpha-HSD [AKR 1C8] cDNA and high-stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with gene-specific primers, we were able to isolate the human 20alpha-HSD, bile acid-binding protein (BABP) [AKR 1C2], prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) [AKR 1C3], and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) 4 [AKR 1C4] genes. These genes had similar exon-intron organizations and shared a high homology. The four recombinant enzymes encoded by these genes showed distinct substrate specificity. By reverse transcription-PCR analysis, human 20alpha-HSD, BABP and PGFS mRNAs were expressed ubiquitously, while DD4 mRNA was restricted to the liver. Promoter activities of the 20alpha-HSD, BABP and PGFS genes were high, both in ovarian granulosa cells and hepatocytes. Radiation hybridization analysis revealed that all these genes were located close together in chromosome 10. CONCLUSION: The human gene encoding for the progesterone-metabolizing enzyme 20alpha-HSD in the female reproductive system was cloned, and its expression and gene localization were elucidated. BABP, PGFS and DD4 genes, which were highly homologous to the 20alpha-HSD gene, were also cloned, and their structure and function were characterized.

human kallikrein	hK1	The new human kallikrein gene family: implications in carcinogenesis. The traditional human kallikrein gene family consists of three genes, namely KLK1 [encoding human kallikrein 1 (hK1) or pancreatic/renal kallikrein], KLK2 (encoding hK2, previously known as human glandular kallikrein 1) and KLK3 [encoding hK3 or prostate-specific antigen (PSA)]. KLK2 and KLK3 have important applications in prostate cancer diagnostics and, more recently, in breast cancer diagnostics. During the past two to three years, new putative members of the human kallikrein gene family have been identified, including the PRSSL1 gene [encoding normal epithelial cell-specific 1 gene (NES1)], the gene encoding zyme/protease M/neurosin, the gene encoding prostase/KLK-L1, and the genes encoding neuropsin, stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme and trypsin-like serine protease. Another five putative kallikrein genes, provisionally named KLK-L2, KLK-L3, KLK-L4, KLK-L5 and KLK-L6, have also been identified. Many of the newly identified kallikrein-like genes are regulated by steroid hormones, and a few kallikreins (NES1, protease M, PSA) are known to be downregulated in breast and possibly other cancers. NES1 appears to be a novel breast cancer tumor suppressor protein and PSA a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. This brief review summarizes recent developments and possible applications of the newly defined and expanded human kallikrein gene locus.

beta - amyloid precursor	APP	Human aspartic protease memapsin 2 cleaves the beta-secretase site of beta-amyloid precursor protein. The cDNAs of two new human membrane-associated aspartic proteases, memapsin 1 and memapsin 2, have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences show that each contains the typical pre, pro, and aspartic protease regions, but each also has a C-terminal extension of over 80 residues, which includes a single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytosolic domain. Memapsin 2 mRNA is abundant in human brain. The protease domain of memapsin 2 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified. Recombinant memapsin 2 specifically hydrolyzed peptides derived from the beta-secretase site of both the wild-type and Swedish mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) with over 60-fold increase of catalytic efficiency for the latter. Expression of APP and memapsin 2 in HeLa cells showed that memapsin 2 cleaved the beta-secretase site of APP intracellularly. These and other results suggest that memapsin 2 fits all of the criteria of beta-secretase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the in vivo production of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide leading to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Recombinant memapsin 2 also cleaved a peptide derived from the processing site of presenilin 1, albeit with poor kinetic efficiency. Alignment of cleavage site sequences of peptides indicates that the specificity of memapsin 2 resides mainly at the S(1)' subsite, which prefers small side chains such as Ala, Ser, and Asp.
human cpg binding	hCGBP	Cloning of a mammalian transcriptional activator that binds unmethylated CpG motifs and shares a CXXC domain with DNA methyltransferase, human trithorax, and methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1. Ligand screening was utilized to isolate a human cDNA that encodes a novel CpG binding protein, human CpG binding protein (hCGBP). This factor contains three cysteine-rich domains, two of which exhibit homology to the plant homeodomain finger domain. A third cysteine-rich domain conforms to the CXXC motif identified in DNA methyltransferase, human trithorax, and methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1. A fragment of hCGBP that contains the CXXC domain binds to an oligonucleotide probe containing a single CpG site, and this complex is disrupted by distinct oligonucleotide competitors that also contain a CpG motif(s). However, hCGBP fails to bind oligonucleotides in which the CpG motif is either mutated or methylated, and it does not bind to single-stranded DNA or RNA probes. Furthermore, the introduction of a CpG dinucleotide into an unrelated oligonucleotide sequence is sufficient to produce a binding site for hCGBP. Native hCGBP is detected as an 88-kDa protein by Western analysis and is ubiquitously expressed. The DNA-binding activity of native hCGBP is apparent in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and hCGBP trans-activates promoters that contain CpG motifs but not promoters in which the CpG is ablated. These data indicate that hCGBP is a transcriptional activator that recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, suggesting a role in modulating the expression of genes located within CpG islands.
synaptonemal	SC	STAG3, a novel gene encoding a protein involved in meiotic chromosome pairing and location of STAG3-related genes flanking the Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion. Chromatin rearrangements in the meiotic prophase are characterized by the assembly and disassembly of synaptonemal complexes (SC), a protein structure that stabilizes the pairing of homologous chromosomes in prophase. We report the identification of human and mouse cDNA coding for stromalin 3 (STAG3), a new mammalian stromalin member of the synaptonemal complex. The stromalins are a group of highly conserved proteins, represented in several organisms from yeast to humans. Stromalins are characterized by the stromalin conservative domain (SCD), a specific motif found in all proteins of the family described to date. STAG3 is expressed specifically in testis, and immunolocalization experiments show that STAG3 is associated to the synaptonemal complex. As the protein encoded by the homologous gene (Scc3p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be a subunit of a cohesin complex that binds chromosomes until the onset of anaphase, our data suggest that STAG3 is involved in chromosome pairing and maintenance of synaptonemal complex structure during the pachytene phase of meiosis in a cohesin-like manner. We have mapped the human STAG3 gene to the 7q22 region of chromosome 7; six human STAG3-related genes have also been mapped: two at 7q22 near the functional gene, one at 7q11.22, and three at 7q11.23, two of them flanking the breakpoints commonly associated with the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) deletion. Since the WBS deletion occurs as a consequence of unequal meiotic crossing over, we suggest that STAG3 duplications predispose to germline chromosomal rearrangement within this region.

protease - activated	PARs	Cathepsin G activates protease-activated receptor-4 in human platelets. Of the four known protease-activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 and PAR4 are expressed by human platelets and mediate thrombin signaling. Whether these receptors are redundant, interact, or play at least partially distinct roles is unknown. It is possible that PAR1 and/or PAR4 might confer responsiveness to proteases other than thrombin. The neutrophil granule protease, cathepsin G, is known to cause platelet secretion and aggregation. We now report that this action of cathepsin G is mediated by PAR4. Cathepsin G triggered calcium mobilization in PAR4-transfected fibroblasts, PAR4-expressing Xenopus oocytes, and washed human platelets. An antibody raised against the PAR4 thrombin cleavage site blocked platelet activation by cathepsin G but not other agonists. Desensitization with a PAR4 activating peptide had a similar effect. By contrast, inhibition of PAR1 function had no effect on platelet responses to cathepsin G. When neutrophils were present, the neutrophil agonist fMet-Leu-Phe triggered calcium signaling in Fura-2-loaded platelets. Strikingly, this neutrophil-dependent platelet activation was blocked by the PAR4 antibody. These data show that PAR4 mediates platelet responses to cathepsin G and support the hypothesis that cathepsin G might mediate neutrophil-platelet interactions at sites of vascular injury or inflammation.
pre - b cell	pre-BCR	VPREB3: cDNA characterization and expression in human and chromosome mapping in human and mouse. The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) regulates pre-B cell expansion and allelic exclusion at the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus and mediates the selection of Ig heavy chain variable gene segments. During the early phase of pre-BCR assembly in the mouse, the membrane Ig mu heavy chain transiently associates with the VPREB3 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present the human VPREB3 cDNA sequence and its B cell-specific expression in hematopoietic cell lines. We have localized this gene to chromosome 22q11 close to IGLL genes in human and to chromosome 10C in mouse.

None	PTN	Pleiotrophin signals increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta beta-catenin through inactivation of the intrinsic catalytic activity of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a platelet-derived growth factor-inducible, 18-kDa heparin-binding cytokine that signals diverse phenotypes in normal and deregulated cellular growth and differentiation. To seek the mechanisms of PTN signaling, we studied the interactions of PTN with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) beta/zeta in U373-MG cells. Our results suggest that PTN is a natural ligand for RPTP beta/zeta. PTN signals through " ligand-dependent receptor inactivation " of RPTP beta/zeta and disrupts its normal roles in the regulation of steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. We have found that PTN binds to and functionally inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTP beta/zeta. We also have found that an active site-containing domain of RPTP beta/zeta both binds beta-catenin and functionally reduces its levels of tyrosine phosphorylation when added to lysates of pervanidate-treated cells. In contrast, an (inactivating) active-site mutant of RPTP beta/zeta also binds beta-catenin but fails to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Finally, in parallel to its ability to inactivate endogenous RPTP beta/zeta, PTN sharply increases tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin in PTN-treated cells. The results suggest that in unstimulated cells, RPTP beta/zeta is intrinsically active and functions as an important regulator in the reciprocal control of the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation levels of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The results also suggest that RPTP beta/zeta is a functional receptor for PTN; PTN signals through ligand-dependent receptor inactivation of RPTP beta/zeta to increase levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin to initiate downstream signaling. PTN is the first natural ligand identified for any of the RPTP family; its identification provides a unique tool to pursue the novel signaling pathway activated by PTN and the relationship of PTN signaling with other pathways regulating beta-catenin.

bare	Bpa	Mutations in the NSDHL gene, encoding a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, cause CHILD syndrome. We report for the first time that CHILD syndrome (MIM 308050), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait characterized by an inflammatory nevus with striking lateralization and strict midline demarcation, as well as ipsilateral hypoplasia of the body is caused by mutations in the gene NSDHL located at Xq28 (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) encoding a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase functioning in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. SSCA and genomic sequence analysis of NSDHL identified in 6 patients with CHILD syndrome, including one boy as well as a mother and her daughter, mutations potentially impairing protein function. This phenotype is distinct from, but shares various clinical and biochemical findings with chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2, MIM 302960). CDPX2 is due to mutations affecting a delta8-delta7 sterol isomerase (EBP, emopamil binding protein, at Xp11.22-p11.23) that functions downstream of NSDHL in a later step of cholesterol biosynthesis. EBP was unaffected in the patients analyzed by us demonstrating that CHILD syndrome and CDPX2 are not caused by allelic mutations. Two mouse X-linked dominant male-lethal traits, bare patches (Bpa) and striated (Str) had previously been associated with mutations in Nsdhl. They provide animal models for the study of CHILD syndrome, a further human condition due to mutations in a gene of the cholesterol synthesis pathway.

glutaminas	GA	Isolation, characterization and expression of a human brain mitochondrial glutaminase cDNA. Various cDNAs that encode overlapping portions of the full-length human brain glutaminase (GA) cDNA were cloned and sequenced. The overall nucleotide sequence of hGA has a very high degree of identity with that of the rat kidney-type GA cDNA (77.4%) and the known portion of the cDNA that encodes the 5.0-kb porcine GA mRNA (81.1%). The identity is even more remarkable at the amino acid level, particularly in the C-terminal half where the three proteins share a 99.7% sequence identity. The hGA cDNA encodes a 73,427-Da protein that contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and retains the primary proteolytic cleavage site characterized for the cytosolic precursor of the rat renal mitochondrial glutaminase. The entire coding region was assembled through the use of unique restriction sites and cloned into a baculovirus. Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant virus express high levels of properly processed and active glutaminase. Thus, expression of the isolated hGA cDNA should provide a means to purify large amounts of the mitochondrial glutaminase, a protein that catalyzes a key reaction in the metabolism of glutamine and the synthesis of important excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.
tp53 - target gene	TP53TG5	Isolation and characterization of a novel TP53-inducible gene, TP53TG5, which suppresses growth and shows cell cycle-dependent transition of expression. Through a strategy of direct cloning of TP53-binding DNA sequences from human genome DNA, we have identified a novel TP53-target gene, termed TP53TG5 (TP53-target gene 5). This gene, localized to chromosome band 20q13.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, encodes a 290-amino-acid peptide with no significant homology with any known proteins in the public database. A colony-formation assay using human glioblastoma cell line T98G, which lacks wild-type TP53 and expresses no endogenous TP53TG5, revealed a growth-suppressive effect of the TP53TG5 gene product. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies, following transfection of T98G with plasmid designed to express green fluorescent protein-fused TP53TG5, revealed cell cycle-dependent intracellular localization of this protein. Our results suggest that functional studies of TP53TG5 may provide new insights into the complex physiological activities of TP53.
epstein - barr	EBV	Ubinuclein, a novel nuclear protein interacting with cellular and viral transcription factors. The major target tissues for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are B lymphocytes and epithelial cells of the oropharyngeal zone. The product of the EBV BZLF1 early gene, EB1, a member of the basic leucine-zipper family of transcription factors, interacts with both viral and cellular promoters and transcription factors, modulating the reactivation of latent EBV infection. Here, we characterize a novel cellular protein interacting with the basic domains of EB1 and c-Jun, and competing of their binding to the AP1 consensus site. The transcript is present in a wide variety of human adult, fetal, and tumor tissues, and the protein is detected in the nuclei throughout the human epidermis and as either grainy or punctuate nuclear staining in the cultured keratinocytes. The overexpression of tagged cDNA constructs in keratinocytes revealed that the NH(2) terminus is essential for the nuclear localization, while the central domain is responsible for the interaction with EB1 and for the phenotype of transfected keratinocytes similar to terminal differentiation. The gene was identified in tail-to-tail orientation with the periplakin gene (PPL) in human chromosome 16p13.3 and in a syntenic region in mouse chromosome 16. We designated this novel ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein as ubinuclein and the corresponding gene as UBN1.

survival of motor	SMN	Gemin4. A novel component of the SMN complex that is found in both gems and nucleoli. The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein, the product of the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene, is localized both in the cytoplasm and in discrete nuclear bodies called gems. In both compartments SMN is part of a large complex that contains several proteins including Gemin2 (formerly SIP1) and the DEAD box protein Gemin3. In the cytoplasm, the SMN complex is associated with snRNP Sm core proteins and plays a critical role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly. In the nucleus, SMN is required for pre-mRNA splicing by serving in the regeneration of spliceosomes. These functions are likely impaired in cells of SMA patients because they have reduced levels of functional SMN. Here, we report the identification by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry of a novel component of the SMN complex that we name Gemin4. Gemin4 is associated in vivo with the SMN complex through a direct interaction with Gemin3. The tight interaction of Gemin4 with Gemin3 suggests that it could serve as a cofactor of this DEAD box protein. Gemin4 also interacts directly with several of the Sm core proteins. Monoclonal antibodies against Gemin4 efficiently immunoprecipitate the spliceosomal U snRNAs U1 and U5 from Xenopus oocytes cytoplasm. Immunolocalization experiments show that Gemin4 is colocalized with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Interestingly, Gemin4 is also detected in the nucleoli, suggesting that the SMN complex may also function in preribosomal RNA processing or ribosome assembly.

cyclic nucleotide phosphodiestera	PDE	Molecular cloning and characterization of a distinct human phosphodiesterase gene family: PDE11A. We report here the cloning, expression, and characterization of human PDE11A1, a member of a distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family. PDE11A exhibits < /=50% amino acid identity with the catalytic domains of all other PDEs, being most similar to PDE5, and has distinct biochemical properties. The human PDE11A1 cDNA isolated contains a complete open reading frame encoding a 490-amino acid enzyme with a predicted molecular mass of 55,786 Da. At the N terminus PDE11A1 has a single GAF domain homologous to that found in other signaling molecules, including PDE2, PDE5, PDE6, and PDE10, which constitutes a potential allosteric binding site for cGMP or another small ligand. Tissue distribution studies indicate that PDE11A mRNA occurs at highest levels in skeletal muscle, prostate, kidney, liver, pituitary, and salivary glands and testis. PDE11A is expressed as at least three major transcripts of approximately 10.5, approximately 8.5, and approximately 6.0 kb, thus suggesting the existence of multiple subtypes. This possibility is further supported by the detection of three distinct proteins of approximately 78, approximately 65, and approximately 56 kDa by Western blotting of human tissues for PDE11A isoforms. Recombinant human PDE11A1 hydrolyzes both cGMP and cAMP with K(m) values of 0.52 microM and 1.04 microM, respectively, and similar V(max) values. Therefore, PDE11A represents a dual-substrate PDE that may regulate both cGMP and cAMP under physiological conditions. PDE11A is sensitive to the nonselective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) as well as zaprinast and dipyridamole, inhibitors that are generally considered relatively specific for the cGMP-selective PDEs, with IC(50) values of 49.8 microM, 12.0 microM, and 0.37 microM, respectively.

neuroendocrine secretory protein	NESP55	Neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 (NESP55): alternative splicing onto transcripts of the GNAS gene and posttranslational processing of a maternally expressed protein. Recent studies established a novel genomically imprinted gene located 45 kb upstream of the human GNAS1 locus. This locus encoded for the Neuroendocrine Secretory Protein with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 (NESP55), which is transcribed exclusively from the maternal allele. We sequenced rat and human NESP55 and investigated tissue-specific splicing of its mRNA and posttranslational modifications of the protein in various tissues. Alternative mRNA splicing of NESP55 was analyzed by sequencing of cDNA clones, RT-PCR and Northern blotting. Two main splice variants, which were generated in a tissue-specific manner, were identified: The open reading frame encoding NESP55 was spliced onto exons 2-13 of Gsalpha in the adrenal medulla, pituitary and the brain. In addition, in the pituitary a second shorter, prominent mRNA transcript was generated by splicing of NESP55 onto exons 2, 3 and N1 of Gsalpha. Several of the cDNA clones isolated contained inverted repeats of 50-150 bp at their 5' or 3' termini, which might form hairpin stems and thus alter mRNA stability. The NESP55 open reading frame encoded a hydrophilic protein of 28,018 Da (human) and 29,218 Da (rat), respectively, which resembled the class of acidic, neuroendocrine secretory proteins collectively called chromogranins. NESP55 is highly conserved among mammalian species. It is posttranslationally acidified by the addition of keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and differentially processed by endopeptidases in various endocrine and neuronal tissues.
monocyte chemoattractant	MCP	CCR11 is a functional receptor for the monocyte chemoattractant protein family of chemokines. Chemokines mediate their diverse activities through G protein-coupled receptors. The human homolog of the bovine orphan receptor PPR1 shares significant similarity to chemokine receptors. Transfection of this receptor into murine L1.2 cells resulted in responsiveness to monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC(50) of 0.14 nM. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC(50) of 0.45 nM. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) and MCP-3 (IC(50) = 4.1 nM) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC(50) = 10.7 nM) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung. Thus CCR11 shares functional similarity to CCR2 because it recognizes members of the MCP family, but CCR11 has a distinct expression pattern.
None	Asc-1	Identification and characterization of a Na(+)-independent neutral amino acid transporter that associates with the 4F2 heavy chain and exhibits substrate selectivity for small neutral D- and L-amino acids. A cDNA was isolated from the mouse brain that encodes a novel Na(+)-independent neutral amino acid transporter. The encoded protein, designated as Asc-1 (asc-type amino acid transporter 1), was found to be structurally related to recently identified mammalian amino acid transporters for the transport systems L, y(+)L, x(C)(-), and b(0,+), which are linked, via a disulfide bond, to the type II membrane glycoproteins, 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), or rBAT (related to b(0,+) amino acid transporter). Asc-1 required 4F2hc for its functional expression. In Western blot analysis in the nonreducing condition, a 118-kDa band, which seems to correspond to the heterodimeric complex of Asc-1 and 4F2hc, was detected in the mouse brain. The band shifted to 33 kDa in the reducing condition, confirming that Asc-1 and 4F2hc are linked via a disulfide bond. Asc-1-mediated transport was not dependent on the presence of Na(+) or Cl(-). Although Asc-1 showed a high sequence homology (66% identity at the amino acid level) to the Na(+)-independent broad scope neutral amino acid transporter LAT2 (Segawa, H., Fukasawa, Y., Miyamoto, K., Takeda, E., Endou, H., and Kanai, Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 19745-19751), Asc-1 also exhibited distinctive substrate selectivity and transport properties. Asc-1 preferred small neutral amino acids such as Gly, L-Ala, L-Ser, L-Thr, and L-Cys, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid as substrates. Asc-1 also transported D-isomers of the small neutral amino acids, in particular D-Ser, a putative endogenous modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, with high affinity. Asc-1 operated preferentially, although not exclusively, in an exchange mode. Asc-1 mRNA was detected in the brain, lung, small intestine, and placenta. The functional properties of Asc-1 seem to be consistent with those of a transporter subserving the Na(+)-independent small neutral amino acid transport system asc.

In Western blot analysis in the nonreducing condition, a 118-kDa band, which seems to correspond to the heterodimeric complex of Asc-1 and 4F2hc, was detected in the mouse brain. The band shifted to 33 kDa in the reducing condition, confirming that Asc-1 and 4F2hc are linked via a disulfide bond. Asc-1-mediated transport was not dependent on the presence of Na(+) or Cl(-). Although Asc-1 showed a high sequence homology (66% identity at the amino acid level) to the Na(+)-independent broad scope neutral amino acid transporter LAT2 (Segawa, H., Fukasawa, Y., Miyamoto, K., Takeda, E., Endou, H., and Kanai, Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 19745-19751), Asc-1 also exhibited distinctive substrate selectivity and transport properties. Asc-1 preferred small neutral amino acids such as Gly, L-Ala, L-Ser, L-Thr, and L-Cys, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid as substrates. Asc-1 also transported D-isomers of the small neutral amino acids, in particular D-Ser, a putative endogenous modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, with high affinity. Asc-1 operated preferentially, although not exclusively, in an exchange mode. Asc-1 mRNA was detected in the brain, lung, small intestine, and placenta. The functional properties of Asc-1 seem to be consistent with those of a transporter subserving the Na(+)-independent small neutral amino acid transport system asc.
None	rBAT	Identification and characterization of a Na(+)-independent neutral amino acid transporter that associates with the 4F2 heavy chain and exhibits substrate selectivity for small neutral D- and L-amino acids.

vitelliform macular dystrop	AVMD	VMD2 mutations in vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease) and other maculopathies. Mutations in the gene VMD2 are associated with autosomal dominant vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease). VMD2 is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and codes for a 585 amino acid putative transmembrane protein with undetermined functional properties. To date, 48 different mutations, predominantly missense, have been described in Best disease families. These mutations generally affect amino acids in the first 50% of the protein, and occur in four distinct clusters possibly representing regions of functional importance. VMD2 has also been investigated in other macular diseases. Mutations have been documented in a significant percentage of patients with adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) and in a single case of " bull's-eye " maculopathy. Results of analysis in two large series of individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) suggest that VMD2 does not play a major role in this prevalent disorder.

madin - darby canine	MDCK	MAL, a proteolipid in glycosphingolipid enriched domains: functional implications in myelin and beyond. The myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL (VIP17/MVP17) is a proteolipid of 17 kD with a hydrophobicity pattern that indicates a four transmembrane domain structure. The MAL cDNA has been cloned from human T-cells, rat oligodendrocytes and the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. In the nervous system both myelinating cells, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, express MAL protein. MAL expression parallels myelin formation, and MAL is predominantly localized in compact myelin. Prior to myelin formation MAL is also found in immature Schwann cells. Outside the nervous system MAL expression is found in T-cells and in distinct epithelial cells, e.g. in kidney, stomach and thyroid gland, where MAL is localised in the apical plasma membrane. Specific glycosphingolipids, e.g. galactosylceramide and sulfatide, are enriched in such apical kidney and stomach membranes as well as in myelin. MAL copurifies with these glycosphingolipids in detergent insoluble domains, indicating a close association and possible functional interactions of MAL with glycosphingolipids in these tissues. Moreover, recent reports point to additional functions of MAL-glycosphingolipid complexes in signalling, cell differentiation and apical sorting. The role of MAL in the formation, stabilisation and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains and its contribution to specific membrane properties in myelin and epithelial cells are discussed.
human intestinal lamina propria lymph	LPL	Human intestinal lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes express receptors specific for chemokines induced by inflammation. To determine which chemokine receptors might be involved in T lymphocyte localization to the intestinal mucosa, we examined receptor expression on human intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and CD45RO+beta7hi gut homing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Virtually all LPL and IEL expressed CXCR3 and CCR5, receptors that have been associated with Th1(Tc1)/Th0 lymphocytes, while CCR3 and CCR4, receptors associated with Th2 (Tc2)lymphocytes, CCR7, CXCR1 and CXCR2 were not expressed. CXCR3 and CCR5 receptors were functional, as LPL and IEL migrated to their respective ligands I-TAC and RANTES. In addition, most alphaEbeta7- LPL and IEL expressed high levels of CCR2. While the majority of CD45RO(-)beta7hi PBL also expressed CXCR3 and CCR5, a proportion of these cells were CXCR3- and/or CCR5- and some expressed CCR4 and/or CCR7, indicating that lymphocytes recruited to the intestinal mucosa represent a subset of these cells. In summary, our results show that LPL and IEL within the normal intestine express a specific and similar array of chemokine receptors whose ligands are constitutively expressed in the intestinal mucosa and whose expression is up-regulated during intestinal inflammation. These results support the view that CXCR3, CCR5 and CCR2 may play an important role in lymphocyte localization within the intestinal mucosa.

plant homeodoma	PHD	Mutations in ATRX, encoding a SWI/SNF-like protein, cause diverse changes in the pattern of DNA methylation. A goal of molecular genetics is to understand the relationship between basic nuclear processes, epigenetic changes and the numerous proteins that orchestrate these effects. One such protein, ATRX, contains a highly conserved plant homeodomain (PHD)-like domain, present in many chromatin-associated proteins, and a carboxy-terminal domain which identifies it as a member of the SNF2 family of helicase/ATPases. Mutations in ATRX give rise to characteristic developmental abnormalities including severe mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, urogenital abnormalities and alpha-thalassaemia. This circumstantial evidence suggests that ATRX may act as a transcriptional regulator through an effect on chromatin. We have recently shown that ATRX is localized to pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis, suggesting that ATRX might exert other chromatin-mediated effects in the nucleus. Moreover, at metaphase, some ATRX is localized at or close to the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays on the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes. Here we show that mutations in ATRX give rise to changes in the pattern of methylation of several highly repeated sequences including the rDNA arrays, a Y-specific satellite and subtelomeric repeats. Our findings provide a potential link between the processes of chromatin remodelling, DNA methylation and gene expression in mammalian development.

spondylocostal dysost	SD	Mutations in the human delta homologue, DLL3, cause axial skeletal defects in spondylocostal dysostosis. Spondylocostal dysostosis (SD, MIM 277300) is a group of vertebral malsegmentation syndromes with reduced stature resulting from axial skeletal defects. SD is characterized by multiple hemivertebrae, rib fusions and deletions with a non-progressive kyphoscoliosis. Cases may be sporadic or familial, with both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance reported. Autosomal recessive SD maps to a 7.8-cM interval on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 that is homologous with a mouse region containing a gene encoding the Notch ligand delta-like 3 (Dll3). Dll3 is mutated in the X-ray-induced mouse mutant pudgy (pu), causing a variety of vertebrocostal defects similar to SD phenotypes. Here we have cloned and sequenced human DLL3 to evaluate it as a candidate gene for SD and identified mutations in three autosomal recessive SD families. Two of the mutations predict truncations within conserved extracellular domains. The third is a missense mutation in a highly conserved glycine residue of the fifth epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat, which has revealed an important functional role for this domain. These represent the first mutations in a human Delta homologue, thus highlighting the critical role of the Notch signalling pathway and its components in patterning the mammalian axial

mast cell immunoreceptor signal transdu	MIST	A BASH/SLP-76-related adaptor protein MIST/Clnk involved in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation. Cross-linking of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on mast cells by IgE-antigen complex triggers signal transduction cascades leading to the release of inflammatory mediators and production of cytokines, which are critical for the development of allergic reactions. We have identified a novel member of the BASH/SLP-76 immunoreceptor-coupled adaptor family expressed in mast cells, termed MIST (for mast cell immunoreceptor signal transducer), which has later been found to be identical to a recently reported cytokine-dependent hemopoietic cell linker, Clnk. Upon FcepsilonRI cross-linking, MIST/Clnk is tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with signaling proteins, phospholipase Cgamma, Vav, Grb2 and linker for activation of T cells (LAT). Overexpression of a mutant form of MIST/Clnk inhibited FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation, increase in intracellular Ca(2+), NF-AT activation and phosphorylation of LAT. As a crucial signaling component for FcepsilonRI-induced mast cell degranulation, MIST/Clnk might serve as a target for anti-allergic therapy.

n - methyl - d - aspar	NMDA	NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Basal dendrites are a major target for synaptic inputs innervating cortical pyramidal neurons. At present little is known about signal processing in these fine dendrites. Here we show that coactivation of clustered neighbouring basal inputs initiated local dendritic spikes, which resulted in a 5.9 +/- 1.5 mV (peak) and 64.4 +/- 19.8 ms (half-width) cable-filtered voltage change at the soma that amplified the somatic voltage response by 226 +/- 46%. These spikes were accompanied by large calcium transients restricted to the activated dendritic segment. In contrast to conventional sodium or calcium spikes, these spikes were mediated mostly by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels, which contributed at least 80% of the total charge. The ionic mechanism of these NMDA spikes may allow 'dynamic spike-initiation zones', set by the spatial distribution of glutamate pre-bound to NMDA receptors, which in turn would depend on recent and ongoing activity in the cortical network. In addition, NMDA spikes may serve as a powerful mechanism for modification of the cortical network by inducing long-term strengthening of co-activated neighbouring inputs.
v2 vasopressin	V2R	Pharmacological chaperones rescue cell-surface expression and function of misfolded V2 vasopressin receptor mutants. Over 150 mutations within the coding sequence of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) gene are known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). A large number of these mutant receptors fail to fold properly and therefore are not routed to the cell surface. Here we show that selective, nonpeptidic V2R antagonists dramatically increase cell-surface expression and rescue the function of 8 mutant NDI-V2Rs by promoting their proper folding and maturation. A cell-impermeant V2R antagonist could not mimic these effects and was unable to block the rescue mediated by a permeant agent, indicating that the nonpeptidic antagonists act intracellularly, presumably by binding to and stabilizing partially folded mutants. In addition to opening new therapeutic avenues for NDI patients, these data demonstrate that by binding to newly synthesized mutant receptors, small ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones, promoting the proper folding and maturation of receptors and their targeting to the cell surface.

glycero - d - galacto - nononic	KDN	Cloning and expression of the human N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase gene with 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero- D-galacto-nononic acid biosynthetic ability. Sialic acids participate in many important biological recognition events, yet eukaryotic sialic acid biosynthetic genes are not well characterized. In this study, we have identified a novel human gene based on homology to the Escherichia coli sialic acid synthase gene (neuB). The human gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a 40-kDa enzyme. The gene partially restores sialic acid synthase activity in a neuB-negative mutant of E. coli and results in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) production in insect cells upon recombinant baculovirus infection. In vitro the human enzyme uses N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate as substrates to generate phosphorylated forms of Neu5Ac and KDN, respectively, but exhibits much higher activity toward the Neu5Ac phosphate product.
clostridium perfringens enteroto	CPE	CaCo-2 cells treated with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin form multiple large complex species, one of which contains the tight junction protein occludin. The previous model for the action of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) proposed that (i) CPE binds to host cell receptor(s), forming a small ( approximately 90 kDa) complex, (ii) the small complex interacts with other eucaryotic protein(s), forming a large ( approximately 160 kDa) complex, and (iii) the large complex triggers massive permeability changes, thereby inducing enterocyte death. In the current study, Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that CPE bound to CaCo-2 human intestinal cells at 37 degrees C forms multiple large complex species, with apparent sizes of approximately 200, approximately 155, and approximately 135 kDa. These immunoblot experiments also revealed that occludin, an approximately 65-kDa tight junction protein, is present in the approximately 200-kDa large complex but absent from the other large complex species. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that occludin physically associates with CPE in large complex material and also indicated that occludin is absent from small complex. These results strongly suggest that occludin becomes associated with CPE during formation of the approximately 200-kDa large complex. A postbinding association between CPE and occludin is consistent with the failure of rat fibroblast transfectants expressing occludin to bind CPE in the current study. Those occludin transfectants were also insensitive to CPE, strongly suggesting that occludin expression is not sufficient to confer CPE sensitivity. However, the occludin-containing, approximately 200-kDa large complex may contribute to CPE-induced cytotoxicity, because nontoxic CPE point mutants did not form any large complex species. By showing that large complex material is comprised of several species (one containing occludin), the current studies indicate that CPE action is more complicated than previously appreciated and also provide additional evidence for CPE interactions with tight junction proteins, which could be important for CPE-induced pathophysiology.
beta - site amyloid precursor protein cleaving	BACE	Expression analysis of BACE2 in brain and peripheral tissues. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a novel transmembrane aspartic protease that possesses all the known characteristics of the beta-secretase involved in Alzheimer's disease (Vassar, R., Bennett, B. D., Babu-Khan, S., Kahn, S., Mendiaz, E. A., Denis, P., Teplow, D. B., Ross, S., Amarante, P., Loeloff, R., Luo, Y., Fisher, S., Fuller, J., Edenson, S., Lile, J., Jarosinski, M. A., Biere, A. L., Curran, E., Burgess, T., Louis, J. -C., Collins, F., Treanor, J., Rogers, G., and Citron, M. (1999) Science 286, 735-741). We have analyzed the sequence and expression pattern of a BACE homolog termed BACE2. BACE and BACE2 are unique among aspartic proteases in that they possess a carboxyl-terminal extension with a predicted transmembrane region and together they define a new family. Northern analysis reveals that BACE2 mRNA is expressed at low levels in most human peripheral tissues and at higher levels in colon, kidney, pancreas, placenta, prostate, stomach, and trachea. Human adult and fetal whole brain and most adult brain subregions express very low or undetectable levels of BACE2 mRNA. In addition, in situ hybridization of adult rat brain shows that BACE2 mRNA is expressed at very low levels in most brain regions. The very low or undetectable levels of BACE2 mRNA in the brain are not consistent with the expression pattern predicted for beta-secretase.
epidermal growth	EGF	Importance of the major extracellular domain of CD9 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor for up-regulation of binding and activity. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors. The membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is mitogenically active to neighboring cells as well as being a precursor of the soluble form. In addition to its mitogenic activity, proHB-EGF has the property of binding to diphtheria toxin (DT), serving as the specific receptor for DT. Tetramembrane-spanning protein CD9, a member of the TM4 superfamily, is physically associated with proHB-EGF at the cell surface and up-regulates both mitogenic and DT binding activities of proHB-EGF. To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-alpha, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain. These results indicate that the interaction of the extracellular domains of both molecules is important for up-regulation.

diphtheria	DT	Importance of the major extracellular domain of CD9 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor for up-regulation of binding and activity. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors. The membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is mitogenically active to neighboring cells as well as being a precursor of the soluble form. In addition to its mitogenic activity, proHB-EGF has the property of binding to diphtheria toxin (DT), serving as the specific receptor for DT. Tetramembrane-spanning protein CD9, a member of the TM4 superfamily, is physically associated with proHB-EGF at the cell surface and up-regulates both mitogenic and DT binding activities of proHB-EGF. To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-alpha, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain.

None	uPA	The chemotactic action of urokinase on smooth muscle cells is dependent on its kringle domain. Characterization of interactions and contribution to chemotaxis. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is thought to exert its effects on cell growth, adhesion, and migration by mechanisms involving proteolysis and interaction with its cell surface receptor (uPAR). The functional properties of uPA and the significance of its various domains for chemotactic activity were analyzed using human airway smooth muscle cells (hAWSMC). The wild-type uPA (r-uPAwt), inactive urokinase with single mutation (His(204) to Gln) (r-uPA(H/Q)), urokinase with mutation of His(204) to Gln together with a deletion of growth factor-like domain (r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD), the catalytic domain of urokinase (r-uPA(LMW)), and its kringle domain (r-KD) were expressed in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, r-uPA(H/Q), and r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD elicited similar chemotactic effects. Half-maximal chemotaxis (EC(50)) were apparent at approximately 2 nm with all the uPA variants. The kringle domain induced cell migration with an EC(50) of about 6 nm, whereas the denaturated r-KD and r-uPA(LMW) were without effect. R-uPAwt-induced chemotaxis was dependent on an association with uPAR and a uPA-kringle domain-binding site, determined using a monoclonal uPAR antibody to prevent the uPA-uPAR interaction, and a monoclonal antibody to the uPA-kringle domain. The binding of iodinated r-uPAwt with hAWSMC was due to interaction with a high affinity binding site on the uPAR, and a lower affinity binding site on an unidentified cell surface target, which was mediated exclusively through the kringle domain of urokinase. Specific binding of r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD to hAWSMC involved an interaction with a single site whose characteristics were similar to those of the low affinity site of r-uPAwt binding to hAWSMC. uPAR-deficient HEK 293 cells specifically bound r-uPAwt and r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD via a single, similar type of binding site. These cells migrated when stimulated by r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD and uPAwt, but not r-uPA(LMW). HEK 293 cells transfected with the uPAR cDNA expressed two classes of sites that bound r-uPAwt; however, only a single site was responsible for the binding of r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD. Together, these findings indicate that uPA-induced chemotaxis is dependent on the binding of the uPA-kringle to the membrane surface of cells and the association of uPA with uPAR.

stress - activated protein kinase	SAPKs	Gene 33/Mig-6, a transcriptionally inducible adapter protein that binds GTP-Cdc42 and activates SAPK/JNK. A potential marker transcript for chronic pathologic conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy. Possible role in the response to persistent stress. Chronic stresses, including the mechanical strain caused by hypertension or excess pulmonary ventilation pressure, lead to important clinical consequences, including hypertrophy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pathologic hypertrophy contributes to decreased organ function and, ultimately, organ failure; and cardiac and diabetic renal hypertrophy are major causes of morbidity and morality in the developed world. Likewise, acute respiratory distress syndrome is a serious potential side effect of mechanical pulmonary ventilation. Whereas the deleterious effects of chronic stress are well established, the molecular mechanisms by which these stresses affect cell function are still poorly characterized. gene 33 (also called mitogen-inducible gene-6, mig-6) is an immediate early gene that is transcriptionally induced by a divergent array of extracellular stimuli. The physiologic function of Gene 33 is unknown. Here we show that gene 33 mRNA levels increase sharply in response to a set of commonly occurring chronic stress stimuli: mechanical strain, vasoactive peptides, and diabetic nephropathy. Induction of gene 33 requires the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases. This expression pattern suggests that gene 33 is a potential marker for diabetic nephropathy and other pathologic responses to persistent sublethal stress. The structure of Gene 33 indicates an adapter protein capable of binding monomeric GTPases of the Rho subfamily. Consistent with this, Gene 33 interacts in vivo and, in a GTP-dependent manner, in vitro with Cdc42Hs; and transient expression of Gene 33 results in the selective activation of the SAPKs. These results imply a reciprocal, positive feedback relationship between Gene 33 expression and SAPK activation. Expression of Gene 33 at sufficient levels may enable a compensatory reprogramming of cellular function in response to chronic stress, which may have pathophysiological consequences.
nucleolar helicase of 61 k	NOH61	A novel helicase-type protein in the nucleolus: protein NOH61. We report the identification, cDNA cloning, and molecular characterization of a novel, constitutive nucleolar protein. The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence of the human protein defines a polypeptide of a calculated mass of 61.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.9. Inspection of the primary sequence disclosed that the protein is a member of the family of " DEAD-box " proteins, representing a subgroup of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. ATPase activity of the recombinant protein is evident and stimulated by a variety of polynucleotides tested. Immunolocalization studies revealed that protein NOH61 (nucleolar helicase of 61 kDa) is highly conserved during evolution and shows a strong accumulation in nucleoli. Biochemical experiments have shown that protein NOH61 synthesized in vitro sediments with approximately 11.5 S, i.e., apparently as homo-oligomeric structures. By contrast, sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis of cellular extracts obtained with buffers of elevated ionic strength (600 mM NaCl) revealed that the solubilized native protein sediments with approximately 4 S, suggestive of the monomeric form. Interestingly, protein NOH61 has also been identified as a specific constituent of free nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles but is absent from cytoplasmic ribosomes. Treatment of cultured cells with 1) the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and 2) RNase A results in a complete dissociation of NOH61 from nucleolar structures. The specific intracellular localization and its striking sequence homology to other known RNA helicases lead to the hypothesis that protein NOH61 might be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during the assembly process of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit.
sphingosine - 1 -	SPP	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel mammalian sphingosine kinase type 2 isoform. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) has diverse biological functions acting inside cells as a second messenger to regulate proliferation and survival, and extracellularly, as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene-1 subfamily. Based on sequence homology to murine and human sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1), which we recently cloned (Kohama, T., Oliver, A., Edsall, L. , Nagiec, M. M., Dickson, R., and Spiegel, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23722-23728), we have now cloned a second type of mouse and human sphingosine kinase (mSPHK2 and hSPHK2). mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 encode proteins of 617 and 618 amino acids, respectively, both much larger than SPHK1, and though diverging considerably, both contain the conserved domains found in all SPHK1s. Northern blot analysis revealed that SPHK2 mRNA expression had a strikingly different tissue distribution from that of SPHK1 and appeared later in embryonic development. Expression of SPHK2 in HEK 293 cells resulted in elevated SPP levels. d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine was a better substrate than d-erythro-sphingosine for SPHK2. Surprisingly, d, l-threo-dihydrosphingosine was also phosphorylated by SPHK2. In contrast to the inhibitory effects on SPHK1, high salt concentrations markedly stimulated SPHK2. Triton X-100 inhibited SPHK2 and stimulated SPHK1, whereas phosphatidylserine stimulated both type 1 and type 2 SPHK. Thus, SPHK2 is another member of a growing class of sphingolipid kinases that may have novel functions.

membrane interacting protein of rgs	MIR16	MIR16, a putative membrane glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, interacts with RGS16. We have identified the protein MIR16 (for Membrane Interacting protein of RGS16) from a yeast two-hybrid screen by using RGS16 as bait. MIR16 shares strong homology with bacterial glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases. It interacts with RGS16 and, more weakly, with several other selected RGS proteins. Analysis of deletion mutants showed that the N-terminal region of the RGS domain in RGS16 is required for its interaction with MIR16. MIR16 is an integral membrane glycoprotein, because it remained associated with membrane fractions after alkaline treatment and because, in some cells, it is sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, MIR16 was localized on the plasma membrane in liver and kidney and on intracellular membranes in rat pituitary and cultured pituitary cells. MIR16 represents the only integral membrane protein identified thus far to interact with an RGS domain and, to our knowledge, is the only mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase that has been cloned. The putative enzymatic activity of MIR16 and its interaction with RGS16 suggest that it may play important roles in lipid metabolism and in G protein signaling.
autosomal - dominant polycystic kidney	PKD	The polycystic kidney disease protein PKD2 interacts with Hax-1, a protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Despite the recent positional cloning of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which are mutated in the great majority of patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), the pathogenic mechanism for cyst formation is still unclear. The finding, that the PKD1 and PKD2 proteins interact with each other through their COOH termini, suggests that both proteins are part of the same protein complex or signal transduction pathway. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the PKD2 protein, we isolated the PKD2-interacting protein Hax-1. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the fact that PKD2L, a protein closely related to PKD2, failed to interact with Hax-1. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that in most cells PKD2 and Hax-1 colocalized in the cell body, but in some cells PKD2 and Hax-1 also were sorted into cellular processes and lamellipodia. Furthermore we demonstrated an association between Hax-1 and the F-actin-binding protein cortactin, which suggests a link between PKD2 and the actin cytoskeleton. We speculate that PKD2 is involved in the formation of cell-matrix contacts, which are dysfunctional without a wild-type PKD2 protein, thus leading to cystic enlargement of tubular structures in the kidney, liver, and pancreas.
phosphoinositide - specific phospholipase	PLC	Identification and chromosomal localisation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation of human gene of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C beta(1). Members of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) families are central intermediary in signal transduction in response to the occupancy of receptors by many growth factors. Among PLC isoforms, the type beta(1) is of particular interest because of its reported nuclear localisation in addition to its presence at the plasma membrane. It has been previously shown that both the stimulation and the inhibition of the nuclear PLCbeta(1) under different stimuli implicate PLCbeta(1) as an important enzyme for mitogen-activated cell growth as well as for murine erythroleukaemia cell differentiation. The above findings hinting at a direct involvement of PLCbeta(1) in controlling the cell cycle in rodent cells, and the previously reported mapping of its gene in rat chromosome band 3q35-36, a region frequently rearranged in rat tumours induced by chemical carcinogenesis, prompted us to identify its human homologue. By screening a human foetal brain cDNA library with the rat PLCbeta(1) cDNA probe, we have identified a clone homologous to a sequence in gene bank called KIAA 0581, which encodes a large part of the human PLCbeta(1). By using this human cDNA in fluorescence in situ hybridisation on human metaphases, it has been possible to map human PLCbeta(1) on chromosome 20p12, confirming the synteny between rat chromosome 3 and human chromosome 20 and providing a novel locus of homology between bands q35-36 in rat and p12 in man. Since band 20p12 has been recently reported amplified and/or deleted in several solid tumours, the identification and chromosome mapping of human PLCbeta(1) could pave the way for further investigations on the role exerted both in normal human cells and in human tumours by PLCbeta(1), which has been shown to behave as a key signalling intermediate in the control of the cell cycle.
ralgds -	RGL	The human RGL (RalGDS-like) gene: cloning, expression analysis and genomic organization. Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) and its family members RGL, RLF and RGL2 are involved in Ras and Ral signaling pathways as downstream effector proteins. Here we report the precise localization and cloning of two forms of human RGL gene differing at the amino terminus. Transcript A, cloned from liver cDNA libraries has the same amino terminus as the mouse RGL, whereas transcript B cloned from brain has a substitution of 45 amino acids for the first nine amino acids. At the genomic level, exon 1 of transcript A is replaced by two alternative exons (1B1 and 1B2) in transcript B. Both forms share exons 2 through 18. The human RGL protein shares 94% amino acid identity with the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis shows that human RGL is expressed in a wide variety of tissues with strong expression being seen in the heart, brain, kidney, spleen and testis.

src homology	SH3	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human gene (NESCA) which encodes a putative adapter protein containing SH3. A full-length cDNA encoding a novel protein was isolated and sequenced from a human placental cDNA library. This cDNA consists of 1990 bp and has a predicted open reading frame encoding 433 amino acids. It possesses an Src homology 3 (SH3) motif, a leucine zipper motif and no catalytic domain, suggesting that it seems to be an adapter protein. PCR-based mapping with both a monochromosomal hybrid panel and radiation hybrid cell panels placed the gene to human chromosome 1q21-22.
None	beta(H)	Identification and characterization of beta V spectrin, a mammalian ortholog of Drosophila beta H spectrin. Four mammalian beta-spectrin genes are currently recognized, all encode proteins of approximately 240-280,000 M(r) and display 17 triple helical homologous approximately 106-residue repeat units. In Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, a variant beta spectrin with unusual properties has been recognized. Termed beta heavy (beta(H)), this spectrin contains 30 spectrin repeats, has a molecular weight in excess of 400,000, and associates with the apical domain of polarized epithelia. We have cloned and characterized from a human retina cDNA library a mammalian ortholog of Drosophila beta(H) spectrin, and in accord with standard spectrin naming conventions we term this new mammalian spectrin beta 5 (betaV). The gene for human betaV spectrin (HUBSPECV) is on chromosome 15q21. The 11, 722-nucleotide cDNA of betaV spectrin is generated from 68 exons and is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 416,960. Like its fly counterpart, the derived amino acid sequence of this unusual mammalian spectrin displays 30 spectrin repeats, a modestly conserved actin-binding domain, a conserved membrane association domain 1, a conserved self-association domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain near its COOH terminus. Its putative ankyrin-binding domain is poorly conserved and may be inactive. These structural features suggest that betaV spectrin is likely to form heterodimers and oligomers with alpha spectrin and to interact directly with cellular membranes. Unlike its Drosophila ortholog, betaV spectrin does not contain an SH3 domain but displays in repeat 5 a 45-residue insertion that displays 42% identity to amino acids 85-115 of the E4 protein of type 75 human papilloma virus. Human betaV spectrin is expressed at low levels in many tissues. By indirect immunofluorescence, it is detected prominently in the outer segments of photoreceptor rods and cones and in the basolateral membrane and cytosol of gastric epithelial cells. Unlike its Drosophila ortholog, a distinct apical distribution of betaV spectrin is inapparent in the epithelial cell populations examined, although it is confined to the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. The complete cDNA sequence of human betaV spectrin is available from GenBank(TM) as accession number.
tumor necrosis	TNF	TTRAP, a novel protein that associates with CD40, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-75 and TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), and that inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B activation. CD40 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. CD40 signaling involves the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) to its cytoplasmic domain. We have identified a novel intracellular CD40-binding protein termed TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) that also interacts with TNF-R75 and CD30. The region of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain that is required for TTRAP association overlaps with the TRAF6 recognition motif. Association of TTRAP with CD40 increases profoundly in response to treatment of cells with CD40L. Interestingly, TTRAP also associates with TRAFs, with the highest affinity for TRAF6. In transfected cells, TTRAP inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter mediated by CD40, TNF-R75 or Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and to a lesser extent by TRAF2, TRAF6, TNF-alpha, or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). TTRAP does not affect stimulation of NF-kappaB induced by overexpression of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), the IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), or the NF-kappaB subunit P65/RelA, suggesting it acts upstream of the latter proteins. Our results indicate that we have isolated a novel regulatory factor that is involved in signal transduction by distinct members of the TNF receptor family.

CD40 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. CD40 signaling involves the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) to its cytoplasmic domain. We have identified a novel intracellular CD40-binding protein termed TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) that also interacts with TNF-R75 and CD30. The region of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain that is required for TTRAP association overlaps with the TRAF6 recognition motif. Association of TTRAP with CD40 increases profoundly in response to treatment of cells with CD40L. Interestingly, TTRAP also associates with TRAFs, with the highest affinity for TRAF6. In transfected cells, TTRAP inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter mediated by CD40, TNF-R75 or Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and to a lesser extent by TRAF2, TRAF6, TNF-alpha, or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). TTRAP does not affect stimulation of NF-kappaB induced by overexpression of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), the IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), or the NF-kappaB subunit P65/RelA, suggesting it acts upstream of the latter proteins. Our results indicate that we have isolated a novel regulatory factor that is involved in signal transduction by distinct members of the TNF receptor family.

von willebrand	vWF	Mapping the glycoprotein Ib-binding site in the von willebrand factor A1 domain. The von Willebrand factor (vWF) mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. It does this by forming a bridge between subendothelial collagen and the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex (GPIb). The GPIb-binding site within vWF has been localized to the vWF-A1 domain. Based on the crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain (Emsley, J., Cruz, M., Handin, R., and Liddington, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10396-10401), we introduced point mutations into 16 candidate residues that might form all or part of the GPIb interaction site. We also introduced two mutations previously reported to impair vWF function yielding a total of 18 mutations. The recombinant vWF-A1 mutant proteins were then expressed in Escherichia coli, and the activity of the purified proteins was assessed by their ability to support flow-dependent platelet adhesion and their ability to inhibit ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. Six mutations located on the front and upper anterior face of the folded vWF-A1 domain, R524S, G561S, H563T, T594S/E596A, Q604R, and S607R, showed reduced activity in all the assays, and we suggest that these residues form part of the GPIb interaction site. One mutation, G561S, with impaired activity occurs in the naturally occurring variant form of von Willebrand's disease-type 2M underscoring the physiologic relevance of the mutations described here.

	tRNAs	Characterization and tRNA recognition of mammalian mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase. Animal mitochondrial protein synthesis systems contain two serine tRNAs (tRNAs(Ser)) corresponding to the codons AGY and UCN, each possessing an unusual secondary structure; the former lacks the entire D arm, and the latter has a slightly different cloverleaf structure. To elucidate whether these two tRNAs(Ser) can be recognized by the single animal mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (mt SerRS), we purified mt SerRS from bovine liver 2400-fold and showed that it can aminoacylate both of them. Specific interaction between mt SerRS and either of the tRNAs(Ser) was also observed in a gel retardation assay. cDNA cloning of bovine mt SerRS revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contains 518 amino acid residues. The cDNAs of human and mouse mt SerRS were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag data base searches. Elaborate inspection of primary sequences of mammalian mt SerRSs revealed diversity in the N-terminal domain responsible for tRNA recognition, indicating that the recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS differs considerably from that of its prokaryotic counterpart. In addition, the human mt SerRS gene was found to be located on chromosome 19q13.1, to which the autosomal deafness locus DFNA4 is mapped.

protein phosphatase	PPP4	A novel 50 kDa protein forms complexes with protein phosphatase 4 and is located at centrosomal microtubule organizing centres. Protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) is a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has been implicated in microtubule organization at centrosomes. Complexes of PPP4 with high apparent molecular masses (450 and 600 kDa) were purified from mammalian skeletal muscle and testis to near homogeneity. Amino acid sequences derived from a protein component present in both complexes were utilized to identify a human cDNA. The encoded putative PPP4 regulatory subunit (termed PPP4R2), comprising 453 amino acids, had a molecular mass of 50.4 kDa. The interaction of PPP4R2 with PPP4 catalytic subunit (PPP4c) was confirmed by co-sedimentation of PPP4c with PPP4R2 expressed in bacteria and human cells. PPP4c formed a complex of 450 kDa with baculovirus expressed His(6)-tagged PPP4R2. Immunocytological detection of PPP4R2 at centrosomes suggests that it may target PPP4c to this location. Native 450 kDa and 600 kDa PPP4 complexes are inactive, but can be activated by basic proteins, suggesting that PPP4R2 may also regulate the activity of PPP4c at centrosomal microtubule organising centres.

polysialic	PSA	Overexpression of murine Pax3 increases NCAM polysialylation in a human medulloblastoma cell line. Polysialic acid (PSA) is a developmentally regulated carbohydrate found primarily on neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) in embryonic tissues. The majority of NCAM in adult tissues lacks this unique carbohydrate, but polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) is present in adult brain regions where neural regeneration persists and in some pediatric brain tumors such as medulloblastoma, which show greater propensity for leptomeningeal spread. Pax3, a developmentally regulated paired homeodomain transcription factor, is thought to be involved in the regulation of neural cell adhesion molecules. Overexpression of murine Pax3 into a human medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY) resulted in an increase in NCAM polysialylation and a 2-4-fold increase in alpha2, 8-polysialyltransferase type II mRNA levels. No difference was observed in alpha2,8-polysialyltransferase type IV message. The addition of PSA to NCAM changed the adhesive behavior of these Pax3 transfectants. Transfectants expressing high PSA-NCAM show much less NCAM-dependent aggregation than those with less PSA-NCAM. In addition, Pax3 transfectants having high PSA-NCAM show heterophilic adhesion involving polysialic acid to heparan sulfate proteoglycan and agrin. These observations suggest that a developmentally regulated transcription factor, Pax3, could affect NCAM polysialylation and subsequently cell-cell and cell-substratum interaction.

glycine conjugate of chenodeoxych	GCDC	The bile acid taurochenodeoxycholate activates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent survival signaling cascade. Liver injury during cholestasis reflects a balance between the effects of toxic and nontoxic bile acids. However, the critical distinction between a toxic and nontoxic bile acid remains subtle and unclear. For example, the glycine conjugate of chenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induces hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas the taurine conjugate (TCDC) does not. We hypothesized that the dissimilar cellular responses may reflect differential activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathway. In the bile acid-transporting McNtcp.24 rat hepatoma cell line, TCDC, but not GCDC, stimulated PI3K activity. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of PI3K rendered TCDC cytotoxic, and constitutive activation of PI3K rendered GCDC nontoxic. Both Akt and the atypical protein kinase C isoform zeta (PKCzeta) have been implicated in PI3K-dependent survival signaling. However, TCDC activated PKCzeta, but not Akt. Moreover, inhibition of PKCzeta converted TCDC into a cytotoxic agent, whereas overexpression of wild-type PKCzeta blocked GCDC-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate that TCDC activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in a PI3K- and PKCzeta-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of NF-kappaB by an IkappaB super-repressor rendered TCDC cytotoxic, suggesting that NF-kappaB is also necessary to prevent the cytotoxic effects of TCDC. Collectively, these data suggest that some hydrophobic bile acids such as TCDC activate PI3K-dependent survival pathways, which prevent their otherwise inherent toxicity.

methyl - cpg - binding protein	MeCP2	Histone deacetylase-independent transcriptional repression by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) contains a transcriptional repression domain (TRD), which can act by recruitment of a large transcriptional co-repressor complex containing histone deacetylases HDAC1 and 2. We demonstrate here that transient transcription from the SV40 enhancer/promoter or the SV40 promoter is strongly repressed in a histone deacetylase-independent manner, since repression is not alleviated by Trichostatin A (TSA). In a mutational analysis, repression depends on a conserved 30 residue sequence containing two clusters of basic amino acids. Mutation of the first of these clusters inhibits in vitro interaction between TRD and mSin3A. Furthermore, a subdomain of the TRD containing the conserved 30-residue sequence and 16 flanking amino acids was sufficient to compromise VP16-activated transcription. In summary, our results indicate an alternative, histone deacetylase-independent pathway of transcriptional repression by MeCP2.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a major neutrophil protein and may be involved in the nitration of tyrosine residues observed in a wide range of inflammatory diseases that involve neutrophils and macrophage activation. In order to clarify if nitrite could be a physiological substrate of myeloperoxidase, we investigated the reactions of the ferric enzyme and its redox intermediates, compound I and compound II, with nitrite under pre-steady state conditions by using sequential mixing stopped-flow analysis in the pH range 4-8. At 15 degrees C the rate of formation of the low spin MPO-nitrite complex is (2.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 and (2.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 5. The dissociation constant of nitrite bound to the native enzyme is 2.3 +/- 0.1 mm at pH 7 and 31.3 +/- 0.5 micrometer at pH 5. Nitrite is oxidized by two one-electron steps in the MPO peroxidase cycle. The second-order rate constant of reduction of compound I to compound II at 15 degrees C is (2.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 and (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 5. The rate constant of reduction of compound II to the ferric native enzyme at 15 degrees C is (5.5 +/- 0.1) x 10(2) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 and (8.9 +/- 1.6) x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 5. pH dependence studies suggest that both complex formation between the ferric enzyme and nitrite and nitrite oxidation by compounds I and II are controlled by a residue with a pK(a) of (4.3 +/- 0.3). Protonation of this group (which is most likely the distal histidine) is necessary for optimum nitrite binding and oxidation.
histone deacety	HDAC	Histone deacetylases specifically down-regulate p53-dependent gene activation. p53, the most commonly mutated gene in cancer cells, directs cell cycle arrest or induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to stress. It has been demonstrated that p53 activity is up-regulated in part by posttranslational acetylation. In agreement with these observations, here we show that mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1, -2, and -3 are all capable of down-regulating p53 function. Down-regulation of p53 activity by HDACs is HDAC dosage-dependent, requires the deacetylase activity of HDACs, and depends on the region of p53 that is acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP). These results suggest that interactions of p53 and HDACs likely result in p53 deacetylation, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity. In support of this idea, GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays show that p53 interacts with HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a pre-acetylated p53 peptide was significantly deacetylated by immunoprecipitated wild type HDAC1 but not deacetylase mutant. Also, co-expression of HDAC1 greatly reduced the in vivo acetylation level of p53. Finally, we report that the activation potential of p53 on the BAX promoter, a natural p53-responsive system, is reduced in the presence of HDACs. Taken together, our findings indicate that deacetylation of p53 by histone deacetylases is likely to be part of the mechanisms that control the physiological activity of p53.

None	GRK	Phosphorylation and regulation of a Gq/11-coupled receptor by casein kinase 1alpha. Agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation by one or more of the members of the G-protein receptor kinase (GRK) family is an established model for G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phosphorylation resulting in receptor desensitization. Our recent studies have, however, suggested that an alternative route to GPCR phosphorylation may be an operation involving casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha). In the current study we investigate the involvement of CK1alpha in the phosphorylation of the human m3-muscarinic receptor in intact cells. We show that expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CK1alpha, designed to act in a dominant negative manner, inhibits agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation by approximately 40% in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (Ser(345)-Leu(463)) is an inhibitor of CK1alpha due to its ability to both act as a pseudo-substrate for CK1alpha and form a high affinity complex with CK1alpha. Expression of this peptide was able to reduce both basal and agonist-mediated m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. These results support the notion that CK1alpha is able to mediate GPCR phosphorylation in an agonist-dependent manner and that this may provide a novel mechanism for GPCR phosphorylation. The functional role of phosphorylation was investigated using a mutant of the m3-muscarinic receptor that showed an approximately 80% reduction in agonist-mediated phosphorylation. Surprisingly, this mutant underwent agonist-mediated desensitization suggesting that, unlike many GPCRs, desensitization of the m3-muscarinic receptor is not mediated by receptor phosphorylation. The inositol (1,4, 5)-trisphosphate response did, however, appear to be dramatically potentiated in the phosphorylation-deficient mutant indicating that phosphorylation may instead control the magnitude of the initial inositol phosphate response.

ceruloplas	Cp	Role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in transcriptional activation of ceruloplasmin by iron deficiency. A role of the copper protein ceruloplasmin (Cp) in iron metabolism is suggested by its ferroxidase activity and by the tissue iron overload in hereditary Cp deficiency patients. In addition, plasma Cp increases markedly in several conditions of anemia, e.g. iron deficiency, hemorrhage, renal failure, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and inflammation. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) involved. We have reported that iron chelators increase Cp mRNA expression and protein synthesis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the increase in Cp mRNA is due to increased rate of transcription. We here report the results of new studies designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional activation of Cp by iron deficiency. The 5'-flanking region of the Cp gene was cloned from a human genomic library. A 4774-base pair segment of the Cp promoter/enhancer driving a luciferase reporter was transfected into HepG2 or Hep3B cells. Iron deficiency or hypoxia increased luciferase activity by 5-10-fold compared with untreated cells. Examination of the sequence showed three pairs of consensus hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). Deletion and mutation analysis showed that a single HRE was necessary and sufficient for gene activation. The involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was shown by gel-shift and supershift experiments that showed HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta binding to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Cp promoter HRE. Furthermore, iron deficiency (and hypoxia) did not activate Cp gene expression in Hepa c4 hepatoma cells deficient in HIF-1beta, as shown functionally by the inactivity of a transfected Cp promoter-luciferase construct and by the failure of HIF-1 to bind the Cp HRE in nuclear extracts from these cells. These results are consistent with in vivo findings that iron deficiency increases plasma Cp and provides a molecular mechanism that may help to understand these observations.

guanine nucleotide exchange	GEFs	Mechanism of regulation of the Epac family of cAMP-dependent RapGEFs. Epac1 (cAMP-GEFI) and Epac2 (cAMP-GEFII) are closely related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the small GTPase Rap1, which are directly regulated by cAMP. Here we show that both GEFs efficiently activate Rap2 as well. A third member of the family, Repac (GFR), which lacks the cAMP dependent regulatory sequences, is a constitutive activator of both Rap1 and Rap2. In contrast to Epac1, Epac2 contains a second cAMP binding domain at the N terminus, as does the Epac homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans. Affinity measurements show that this distal cAMP binding domain (the A-site) binds cAMP with much lower affinity than the cAMP binding domain proximal to the catalytic domain (the B-site), which is present in both Epac1 and Epac2. Deletion mutant analysis shows that the high affinity cAMP binding domains are sufficient to regulate the GEFs in vitro. Interestingly, isolated fragments containing the B-sites of either Epac1 or Epac2, but not the A-site from Epac2, inhibit the catalytic domains in trans. This inhibition is relieved by the addition of cAMP. In addition to the cAMP binding domains, both Epac1 and Epac2 have a DEP domain. Deletion of this domain does not affect regulation of Epac1 activity but affects membrane localization. From these results, we conclude that all three members of the Epac family regulate both Rap1 and Rap2. Furthermore, we conclude that the catalytic activity of Epac1 is constrained by a direct interaction between GEF and high affinity cAMP binding domains in the absence of cAMP. Epac1 becomes activated by a release of this inhibition when cAMP is bound.
cyclic adenosine diphosphate rib	cADPR	Interaction of two classes of ADP-ribose transfer reactions in immune signaling. CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells where its expression correlates with differentiation and proliferation. The two enzyme activities displayed by CD38 are an ADP-ribosyl cyclase and a cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) hydrolase that catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR. T lymphocytes can be induced to express CD38 when activated with antibodies against specific antigen receptors. If the activated T cells are then exposed with NAD, cell death by apoptosis occurs. During the exposure of activated T cells to NAD, the CD38 is modified by ecto-mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ecto-mono-ADPRTs) specific for cysteine and arginine residues. Arginine-ADP-ribosylation results in inactivation of both cyclase and hydrolase activities of CD38, whereas cysteine-ADP-ribosylation results only in the inhibition of the hydrolase activity. The arginine-ADP-ribosylation causes a decrease in intracellular cADPR and a subsequent decrease in Ca(2+) influx, resulting in apoptosis of the activated T cells. Our results suggest that the interaction of two classes of ecto-ADP-ribose transfer enzymes plays an important role in immune regulation by the selective induction of apoptosis in activated T cells and that cADPR mediated signaling is essential for the survival of activated T cells.
calmodulin - like skin	CLSP	Identification and cloning of a new calmodulin-like protein from human epidermis. After separating by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis an extract of total proteins from human stratum corneum, two spots were extracted and analyzed for their peptide sequence. The resulting internal protein sequences provided evidence for the identification of a new calcium-binding protein. Cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA was achieved by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two keratinocyte libraries, one from proliferating cultured keratinocytes and one from differentiated keratinocytes of reconstructed human epidermis. The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a new calcium-binding protein of 146 amino acids, a member of the calmodulin family. We named this new protein calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP), since reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies of CLSP expression in 10 different human tissues revealed that this protein was particularly abundant in the epidermis where its expression is directly related to keratinocyte differentiation. Expression of the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded a recombinant protein which allowed its further characterization. rCLSP is able to bind calcium, and similarly to calmodulin, exposes thereafter hydrophobic parts which most likely interact with target proteins. Epidermal proteins retained by CaM affinity column are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those of the rCLSP column. Sequencing of a rCLSP affinity purified protein revealed 100% identity with transglutaminase 3, a key enzyme in terminal differentiation, indicating an important role of CLSP in this process.
ubiquitin - specific protea	UBP	Cloning and characterization of a novel human ubiquitin-specific protease, a homologue of murine UBP43 (Usp18). The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP) are a family of enzymes that cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitinated protein substrates. We have recently cloned UBP43, a novel member of this family from AML1-ETO knock-in mice. To analyze the role of UBP43 in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, we have cloned a full-length human UBP43 cDNA by screening a human monocytic cDNA library as well as by 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses. This cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 372 amino acids with all of the structural motifs of a deubiquitinating enzyme. The human UBP43 mRNA is strongly expressed in human liver and thymus. Transfection analysis has demonstrated that UBP43 is a nuclear protein. Interestingly, the gene encoding human UBP43 maps to chromosome 22q11.2. This region, known as DiGeorge syndrome critical region, contains a minimal area of 2 Mb and is consistently deleted in DiGeorge syndrome and related disorders. The syndrome is marked by thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, parathyroid hypoplasia, or congenital cardiac abnormalities. Taken together, our results broaden the understanding of a new human ubiquitin-specific protease, UBP43, and suggest that this gene may also be related to DiGeorge syndrome.
frizzled -	FZD3	Molecular cloning and genomic structure of human frizzled-3 at chromosome 8p21. WNT receptors encoded by the Frizzled genes are implicated in carcinogenesis as well as in embryonic development. Human Frizzled-3 (FZD3) gene, encoding seven-transmembrane receptor with the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, has been cloned and characterized. Expression of the FZD3 mRNAs was investigated by using three FZD3 specific probes: HF3S1, corresponding to the 5'-UTR and a part of the coding region; HF3S2, corresponding to a part of the coding region; HF3S3, corresponding to the 3'-UTR. HF3S1 and HF3S2 hybridized to the 14.0-, 9.0-, 4.0- and 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA, while HF3S3 hybridized to the 14.0-, 9.0-, and 4.0-kb FZD3 mRNA. The 14. 0-kb FZD3 mRNA was the major transcript in fetal brain and adult cerebellum, while the 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA was the major transcript in adult pancreas, and many cancer cell lines examined. The 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA, alternatively polyadenylated by the internal AATAAA signal in the coding region, is predicted to encode the truncated FZD3 protein lacking the region through the second extracellular loop to the C-terminal tail, and might function as the transmembrane-type antagonist for WNTs. The FZD3 gene consists of 8 exons, and has been mapped to human chromosome 8p21.
None	HNK-1ST	Molecular cloning and expression of two distinct human chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases that belong to the HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene family. Using an expression cloning strategy, the cDNA encoding the human HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) has been cloned. During this cloning we found that HNK-1ST and other Golgi-associated sulfotransferases cloned before share homologous sequences including the RDP motif (Ong, E., Yeh, J.-C., Ding, Y., Hindsgaul, O., and Fukuda, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 223, 5190-5195). Using this conserved sequence in HNK-1ST as a probe, we identified two expressed sequence tags in EST data base which have 31.6 and 30.7% identity with HNK-1ST at the amino acid levels. Expression of these two full-length cDNAs failed to form HNK-1 glycan nor to add sulfate to CD34 or NCAM. Surprisingly, proteins expressed by these cDNAs transferred sulfate to the C-4 position of N-acetylgalactosamine in chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate, thus we named these two enzymes, chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 and -2 (C4ST-1 and C4ST-2). Both C4ST-1 and C4ST-2, however, did not form 4, 6-di-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine when chondroitin sulfate C was used as an acceptor. Moreover, analysis of (35)S-labeled dermatan sulfate formed by C4ST-1 indicate that sulfation preferentially took place in GlcA-->GalNAc unit than in IdoA-->GalNAc unit, suggesting that 4-O-sulfation at N-acetylgalactosamine may precede epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid during dermatan sulfate biosynthesis. Northern analysis demonstrated that the transcript for C4ST-1 is predominantly expressed in peripheral leukocytes and hematopoietic tissues while the C4ST-2 transcript is more widely expressed in various tissues. These results indicate C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 play complementary roles in chondroitin and dermatan sulfate synthesis in different tissues.
metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype	mGluR2	Sequence and expression pattern of a novel human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPRC5B, a family C receptor with a short amino-terminal domain. Query of GenBank with the amino acid sequence of human metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGluR2) identified a predicted gene product of unknown function on BAC clone CIT987SK-A-69G12 (located on chromosome band 16p12) as a homologous protein. The transcript, entitled GPRC5B, was cloned from an expressed sequence tag clone that contained the entire open reading frame of the transcript encoding a protein of 395 amino acids. Analysis of the protein sequence reveal that GPRC5B contains a signal peptide and seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which is a hallmark of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPRC5B displays homology to retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RAIG1, 33% sequence identity) and to several family C (mGluR-like) GPCRs (20-25% sequence identity). Both RAIG1 and GPRC5B have short extracellular amino-terminal domains (ATDs) that contrast the very long ATDs characterizing the receptors currently assigned to family C. However, our results strongly indicate that RAIG1 and GPRC5B form a new subgroup of family C characterized by short ATDs. GPRC5B mRNA is widely expressed in peripheral and central tissues with highest abundance in kidney, pancreas, and testis. This mRNA expression pattern is markedly different from that of RAIG1, which shows a slightly more restricted expression pattern with highest abundance in lung tissue.

retinitis pigmentosa	RP17	Characterization of human retinal fascin gene (FSCN2) at 17q25: close physical linkage of fascin and cytoplasmic actin genes. Retinal fascin is a newly identified photoreceptor-specific paralog of the actin-bundling protein fascin. Fascins crosslink f-actin into highly ordered bundles within dynamic cell extensions such as neuronal growth cone filopodia. We have isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human retinal fascin and characterized the structure of the human retinal fascin gene (FSCN2). The cDNA predicts a protein of 492 amino acids and molecular mass 55,057 that shows 94% identity to bovine retinal fascin and 56% identity to human fascin. Promoter analysis reveals a consensus retinoic acid response element and several potential binding sites for transcription factors Crx and Nrl, which correlates with the retina-specific expression of FSCN2 mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and genomic clone sequencing indicate that the FSCN2 gene lies within 200 kb of the actin gene ACTG1 at 17q25. Database searches revealed that the human fascin gene FSCN1 and actin gene ACTB at 7p22 also coexist within a 200-kb genomic clone. The close physical linkage of these fascin/actin gene pairs suggests that they derive from a common gene duplication event and allows comparison of fascin and actin phylogenetic analyses. Finally, a possible link to the retinitis pigmentosa 17 allele (RP17) at distal 17q was excluded by demonstration of multiple independent segregation events in two RP17 kindreds. Informative FSCN2 polymorphisms were identified and will serve as useful markers in future linkage studies. The likely function of retinal fascin, in light of known fascin roles in other cell types, is to assemble actin microfilaments in support of photoreceptor disk morphogenesis.
prader - willi	PWS	Identification of a testis-specific gene (C15orf2) in the Prader-Willi syndrome region on chromosome 15. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from the loss of paternal contributions for a 2-Mb imprinted region on the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15. Hitherto, five paternally active genes have been identified in this region (ZNF127, NDN, MAGEL2, SNURF-SNRPN, and IPW). Here we report the identification of a novel gene in the PWS critical region, which has been designated " chromosome 15 open reading frame 2 " (C15orf2). C15orf2 is an intronless gene located between MAGEL2 and SNURF-SNRPN. It is associated with a CpG island, which is methylated in all tissues tested except for germ cells. C15orf2 is transcribed as a 7.5-kb mRNA and contains an open reading frame encoding a predicted 1156-amino-acid protein of unknown function. Transcription of C15orf2 occurs exclusively in the testis, and in adult testis samples, we observed biallelic expression. By zoo-blot analysis, we found related sequences in DNA from other primates, but not in nonprimate DNA. We conclude that C15orf2 may play a role in primate spermatogenesis.

glutathione s - transferase	GSTs	Identification, characterization, and crystal structure of the Omega class glutathione transferases. A new class of glutathione transferases has been discovered by analysis of the expressed sequence tag data base and sequence alignment. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) of the new class, named Omega, exist in several mammalian species and Caenorhabditis elegans. In humans, GSTO 1-1 is expressed in most tissues and exhibits glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities characteristic of the glutaredoxins. The structure of GSTO 1-1 has been determined at 2.0-A resolution and has a characteristic GST fold (Protein Data Bank entry code ). The Omega class GSTs exhibit an unusual N-terminal extension that abuts the C terminus to form a novel structural unit. Unlike other mammalian GSTs, GSTO 1-1 appears to have an active site cysteine that can form a disulfide bond with glutathione.
protein of relevant evolutionary and lymphoid	PRELI	PRELI, the human homologue of the avian px19, is expressed by germinal center B lymphocytes. We report the identification of a human cDNA encoding a 25 kDa protein of relevant evolutionary and lymphoid interest (PRELI). PRELI was cloned by screening a B lymphocyte-specific cDNA library with a probe generated by mRNA differential display. PRELI amino acid sequence is 85% similar to the avian px19 protein, expressed within the blood islands and in the liver during avian embryo development. PRELI and px19 contain tandem repeats (A/TAEKAK) of the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) motif, characteristic of a group of survival molecules and originally thought to be present only in plant proteins. Interestingly, PRELI expression is high in the fetal liver, a major site for B cell lymphopoiesis, while the mRNA levels in other fetal tissues such as the brain, lung, and kidney are comparatively low. At the adult stage, PRELI expression is drastically reduced in the liver but exhibits high mRNA levels in the spleen, brain, lung and kidney tissues, suggesting that PRELI expression may be important for the development of vital and immunocompetent organs. Moreover, PRELI is also highly expressed in the adult lymph nodes and peripheral blood leukocytes, further stressing that at the adult stage, PRELI expression may be important during secondary immune responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, the expression of PRELI is predominant within germinal centers (GC), a stage in which B lymphocytes are under a stressful selection pressure. Taken together these data: (i) strongly support the notion that the conserved LEA motif represents a phylogenetic link between plants and animals, (ii) reveal a novel molecule whose expression may play a role in the maturation of distinct human tissues, and (iii) suggest that PRELI expression may be important for GC B lymphocytes.

tetratrico peptide	TPR	The human homologue of the yeast splicing factor prp6p contains multiple TPR elements and is stably associated with the U5 snRNP via protein-protein interactions. An essential step of pre-mRNA spliceosome assembly is the interaction between the snRNPs U4/U6 and U5, to form the [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP. While the tri-snRNP protein Prp6p appears to play an important role for tri-snRNP formation in yeast, little is known about the interactions that connect the two snRNP particles in human tri-snRNPs. Here, we describe the molecular characterisation of a 102kD protein form HeLa tri-snRNPs. The 102kD protein exhibits a significant degree of overall homology with the yeast Prp6p, including the conservation of multiple tetratrico peptide repeats (TPR), making this the likely functional homologue of Prp6p. However, while the yeast Prp6p is considered to be a U4/U6-specific protein, the human 102kD protein was found to be tightly associated with purified 20 S U5 snRNPs. This association appears to be primarily due to protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, antibodies directed against the C-terminal TPR elements of the 102kD protein specifically and exclusively immunoprecipitate free U5 snRNPs, but not [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNPs, from HeLa nuclear extract, suggesting that the C-terminal region of the 102kD protein is covered by U4/U6 or tri-snRNP-specific proteins. Since proteins containing TPR elements are typically involved in multiple protein-protein interactions, we suggest that the 102kD protein interacts within the tri-snRNP with both the U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs, thus bridging the two particles. Consistent with this idea, we show that in vitro translated U5-102kD protein binds to purified 13S U4/U6 snRNPs, which contain, in addition to the Sm proteins, all known U4/U6-specific proteins.
endoplasmic retic	ER	Mammalian homologues of yeast sec31p. An ubiquitously expressed form is localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites and is essential for ER-Golgi transport. The yeast coat protein II (COPII) is responsible for vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mammalian functional homologues for all yeast COPII components, except for Sec31p, have been reported. We have cloned a mammalian cDNA whose product (Sec31A) is about 26% identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec31p. Data base searches also revealed another partial sequence encoding a polypeptide (Sec31B) that is 40% identical to Sec31A. Northern analysis revealed that Sec31A transcripts are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed, while Sec31B transcripts are particularly enriched in the testis and thymus, but present in very low levels in other tissues. Sec31A is localized to vesicular structures that scatter throughout the cell but are concentrated at the perinuclear region. The structures marked by Sec31A contain Sec13, a component of COPII that is well characterized to mark the ER exit sites. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Sec31A colocalizes with Sec13 in structures with extensive vesicular-tubular profiles. Antibodies raised against a C-terminal portion of Sec31A co-precipitate Sec13 and inhibit ER-Golgi transport of temperature-arrested vesicular stomatitis G protein in a semi-intact cell assay. Cytosol immunodepleted of Sec31A failed to support vesicular stomatitis G protein transport, which can be rescued by a high molecular weight fraction of the cytosol containing both Sec31A and Sec13. We conclude that Sec31A represents a functional mammalian homologue of yeast Sec31p.

endoplasmic retic	ER	Export from the endoplasmic reticulum represents the limiting step in the maturation and cell surface expression of the human delta opioid receptor. Synthesis and maturation of G protein-coupled receptors are complex events that require an intricate combination of processes that include protein folding, post-translational modifications, and transport through distinct cellular compartments. Relatively little is known about the nature and kinetics of specific steps involved in these processes. Here, the human delta opioid receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293S cells is used as a model to delineate these steps and to establish the kinetics of receptor synthesis, glycosylation, and transport. We found that the receptor is synthesized as a core-glycosylated M(r) 45,000 precursor that is converted to the fully mature M(r) 55,000 receptor with a half-time of about 120 min. In addition to trimming and processing of two N-linked oligosaccharides, maturation involves addition of O-glycans containing N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and sialic acid. In contrast to N-glycosylation, which is initiated co-translationally and is completed when the protein reaches the trans-Golgi network, O-glycosylation was found to occur only after the receptor exits from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was terminated as early as the trans-Golgi cisternae. Once the carbohydrates are fully processed and the receptor reaches the trans-Golgi network, it is transported to the cell surface in about 10 min. The exit from the ER was found to be the limiting step in overall processing of the receptor. This indicates that early events in the folding of the receptor are probably rate-limiting and that receptor folding intermediates are retained in the ER until they can adopt the correct conformation. The overall low efficiency of receptor maturation, less than 50% of the precursor being processed to the fully glycosylated protein, further suggests that only a fraction of the synthesized receptors attain properly folded conformation that allows exit from the ER. This indicates that folding and ER export are key events in control of receptor cell surface expression. Whether or not the low efficiency of the ER export is a general feature among G protein-coupled receptors remains to be investigated.

Growth factors such as insulin regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in many types of cells. However, the mechanism by which the insulin signal is transmitted to the actin cytoskeleton remains largely unknown. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase downstream effector phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) interacted with protein kinase N (PKN), a Rho-binding Ser/Thr protein kinase potentially implicated in a variety of cellular events, including phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components. PDK1 and PKN interacted in vitro and in intact cells, and this interaction was mediated by the kinase domain of PDK1 and the carboxyl terminus of PKN. In addition to a direct interaction, PDK1 also phosphorylated Thr(774) in the activation loop and activated PKN. Insulin treatment or ectopic expression of the wild-type PDK1 or PKN, but not protein kinase Czeta, induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and membrane ruffling in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and Rat1 cells that stably express the insulin receptor (Rat1-IR). However, the insulin-stimulated actin cytoskeleton reorganization in Rat1-IR cells was prevented by expression of kinase-defective PDK1 or PDK1-phosphorylation site-mutated PKN. Thus, phosphorylation by PDK1 appears to be necessary for PKN to transduce signals from the insulin receptor to the actin cytoskeleton.

charybdotox	CTx	A neuronal beta subunit (KCNMB4) makes the large conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channel resistant to charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin. Large conductance voltage and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (MaxiK) channels couple intracellular Ca(2+) with cellular excitability. They are composed of a pore-forming alpha subunit and modulatory beta subunits. The pore blockers charybdotoxin (CTx) and iberiotoxin (IbTx), at nanomolar concentrations, have been invaluable in unraveling MaxiK channel physiological role in vertebrates. However in mammalian brain, CTx-insensitive MaxiK channels have been described [Reinhart, P. H., Chung, S. & Levitan, I. B. (1989) Neuron 2, 1031-1041], but their molecular basis is unknown. Here we report a human MaxiK channel beta-subunit (beta4), highly expressed in brain, which renders the MaxiK channel alpha-subunit resistant to nanomolar concentrations of CTx and IbTx. The resistance of MaxiK channel to toxin block, a phenotype conferred by the beta4 extracellular loop, results from a dramatic ( approximately 1,000 fold) slowdown of the toxin association. However once bound, the toxin block is apparently irreversible. Thus, unusually high toxin concentrations and long exposure times are necessary to determine the role of " CTx/IbTx-insensitive " MaxiK channels formed by alpha + beta4 subunits.

caspase -	Pro-C1	The prodomain of caspase-1 enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis through facilitation of caspase-8 activation. Caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta converting enzyme) is produced in the form of a latent precursor, which is cleaved to yield a prodomain in addition to the p20 and p10 subunits. It has been established that the (p20/p10)(2) heterotetramer processes the latent precursor of interleukin-1beta into an active form during apoptosis, but the function of the residual prodomain of caspase-1 (Pro-C1) has not been established. To evaluate the involvement of Pro-C1 in apoptosis, a Pro-C1 expression vector was transfected into the HeLa cell line, which is susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Expression of recombinant Pro-C1 in HeLa cells enhanced apoptosis mediated by Fas, but not etoposide-induced apoptosis. This enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis was abolished by inhibitors of caspase-8 (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) and caspase-3 (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde) but was only slightly diminished by an inhibitor of caspase-1 (acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone). During apoptosis induced by an agonistic anti-Fas antibody, the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was more pronounced and occurred more rapidly in HeLa/Pro-C1 cells than in the empty vector transfectant (HeLa/vec) cells; in contrast, caspase-1 was not activated in either HeLa/Pro-C1 or HeLa/vec cells. These results demonstrate an additional and novel function for caspase-1 in which Pro-C1 acts to enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis, most probably through facilitation of the activation of caspase-8.
tumor necrosis	TNF	The lymphotoxin-beta receptor is necessary and sufficient for LIGHT-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. LIGHT is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member, which binds two known cellular receptors, lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HveA). LIGHT is a homotrimer that activates proapoptotic and integrin-inducing pathways. Receptor binding residues via LIGHT were identified by introducing point mutations in the A' --> A " and D --> E loops of LIGHT, which altered binding to LTbetaR and HveA. One mutant of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to HveA and is inactive triggering cell death in HT29.14s cells or induction of ICAM-1 in fibroblasts. Studies with HveA- or LTbetaR-specific antibodies further indicated that HveA does not contribute, either cooperatively or by direct signaling, to the death pathway activated by LIGHT. LTbetaR, not HveA, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3), and LIGHT-induced death is blocked by a dominant negative TRAF3 mutant. Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 recruitment propagates death signals initiated by LIGHT-LTbetaR interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for LIGHT-HveA system.

4f2 heavy	4F2hc	Differential influence of the 4F2 heavy chain and the protein related to b(0,+) amino acid transport on substrate affinity of the heteromeric b(0,+) amino acid transporter. We provide evidence here that b(0,+) amino acid transporter (b(0, +)AT) interacts with 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) as well as with the protein related to b(0,+) amino acid transporter (rBAT) to constitute functionally competent b(0,+)-like amino acid transport systems. This evidence has been obtained by co-expression of b(0, +)AT and 4F2hc or b(0,+)AT and rBAT in human retinal pigment epithelial cells and in COS-1 cells. The ability to interact with 4F2hc and rBAT is demonstrable with mouse b(0,+)AT as well as with human b(0,+)AT. Even though both the 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT complex and the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex exhibit substrate specificity that is characteristic of system b(0,+), these two complexes differ significantly in substrate affinity. The 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT complex has higher substrate affinity than the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate that the regional distribution pattern of mRNA in the kidney is identical for b(0,+)AT and 4F2hc. The pattern of rBAT mRNA expression is different from that of b(0,+)AT mRNA and 4F2hc mRNA, but there are regions in the kidney where b(0,+)AT mRNA expression overlaps with rBAT mRNA expression as well as with 4F2hc mRNA expression.

Even though both the 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT complex and the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex exhibit substrate specificity that is characteristic of system b(0,+), these two complexes differ significantly in substrate affinity. The 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT complex has higher substrate affinity than the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate that the regional distribution pattern of mRNA in the kidney is identical for b(0,+)AT and 4F2hc. The pattern of rBAT mRNA expression is different from that of b(0,+)AT mRNA and 4F2hc mRNA, but there are regions in the kidney where b(0,+)AT mRNA expression overlaps with rBAT mRNA expression as well as with 4F2hc mRNA expression.
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance	CFTR	Protein kinase A associates with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator via an interaction with ezrin. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an epithelial Cl(-) channel whose activity is controlled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. We found that CFTR immunoprecipitates from Calu-3 airway cells contain endogenous PKA, which is capable of phosphorylating CFTR. This phosphorylation is stimulated by cAMP and inhibited by the PKA inhibitory peptide. The endogenous PKA that co-precipitates with CFTR could also phosphorylate the PKA substrate peptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (kemptide). Both the catalytic and type II regulatory subunits of PKA are identified by immunoblotting CFTR immunoprecipitates, demonstrating that the endogenous kinase associated with CFTR is PKA, type II (PKA II). Phosphorylation reactions mediated by CFTR-associated PKA II are inhibited by Ht31 peptide but not by the control peptide Ht31P, indicating that a protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) is responsible for the association between PKA and CFTR. Ezrin may function as this AKAP, since it is expressed in Calu-3 and T84 epithelia, ezrin binds RII in overlay assays, and RII is immunoprecipitated with ezrin from Calu-3 cells. Whole-cell patch clamp of Calu-3 cells shows that Ht31 peptide reduces cAMP-stimulated CFTR Cl(-) current, but Ht31P does not. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKA II is linked physically and functionally to CFTR by an AKAP interaction, and they suggest that ezrin serves as an AKAP for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CFTR.

gtpase - activating	GAPs	Evidence for a novel Cdc42GAP domain at the carboxyl terminus of BNIP-2. We recently identified BNIP-2, a previously cloned Bcl-2- and E1B-associated protein, as a putative substrate of the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase and showed that it possesses GTPase-activating activity toward Cdc42 despite the lack of homology to previously described catalytic domains of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). BNIP-2 contains many arginine residues at the carboxyl terminus, which includes the region of homology to the noncatalytic domain of Cdc42GAP, termed BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP homology (BCH) domain. Using BNIP-2 glutathione S-transferase recombinants, it was found that its BCH bound Cdc42, and contributed the GAP activity. This domain was predicted to fold into alpha-helical bundles similar to the topology of the catalytic GAP domain of Cdc42GAP. Alignment of exposed arginine residues in this domain helped to identify Arg-235 and Arg-238 as good candidates for catalysis. Arg-238 matched well to the arginine " finger " required for enhanced GTP hydrolysis in homodimerized Cdc42. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that an R235K or R238K mutation severely impaired the BNIP-2 GAP activity without affecting its binding to Cdc42. From deletion studies, a region adjacent to the arginine patch ((288)EYV(290) on BNIP-2) and the Switch I and Rho family-specific " Insert " region on Cdc42 are involved in the binding. The results indicate that the BCH domain of BNIP-2 represents a novel GAP domain that employs an arginine patch motif similar to that of the Cdc42-homodimer.

endoplasmic retic	ER	Mammalian Sec61 is associated with Sec62 and Sec63. In yeast, efficient protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane may occur co-translationally or post-translationally. The latter process is mediated by a membrane protein complex that consists of the Sec61p complex and the Sec62p-Sec63p subcomplex. In contrast, in mammalian cells protein translocation is almost exclusively co-translational. This transport depends on the Sec61 complex, which is homologous to the yeast Sec61p complex and has been identified in mammals as a ribosome-bound pore-forming membrane protein complex. We report here the existence of ribosome-free mammalian Sec61 complexes that associate with two ubiquitous proteins of the ER membrane. According to primary sequence analysis both proteins display homology to the yeast proteins Sec62p and Sec63p and are therefore named Sec62 and Sec63, respectively. The probable function of the mammalian Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complex is discussed with respect to its abundance in ER membranes, which, in contrast to yeast ER membranes, apparently lack efficient post-translational translocation activity.
ras gtpase - activating	RasGAP	Evidence that Llck-mediated phosphorylation of p56dok and p62dok may play a role in CD2 signaling. The Lck tyrosine kinase is involved in signaling by T cell surface receptors such as TCR/CD3, CD2, and CD28. As other downstream protein-tyrosine kinases are activated upon stimulation of these receptors, it is difficult to assign which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins represent bona fide Lck substrates and which are phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases. We have developed a system in which Lck can be activated independently of TCR/CD3. We have shown that activation of an epidermal growth factor receptor/Lck chimera leads to the specific phosphorylation of Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and two RasGAP-associated proteins, p56(dok) and p62(dok). Activation of the chimeric protein correlates with an increase in cellular Ca(2+) in the absence of ZAP-70 and phospholipase Cgamma1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have found that p62(dok) co-immunoprecipitates with the activated epidermal growth factor receptor/LckF505 and that phosphorylated Dok proteins bind to the Src homology 2 domain of Lck in vitro. In addition, we have shown that activation via the CD2 but not the TCR/CD3 receptor leads to the phosphorylation of p56(dok) and p62(dok). Using JCaM1.6 cells, we have demonstrated that Lck is required for CD2-mediated phosphorylation of Dok proteins. We propose that phosphorylation and Src homology 2-mediated association of p56(dok) and p62(dok) with Lck play a selective function in accessory receptor signal transduction mechanisms.
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid	TREM	Cutting edge: inflammatory responses can be triggered by TREM-1, a novel receptor expressed on neutrophils and monocytes. We have identified new activating receptors of the Ig superfamily expressed on human myeloid cells, called TREM (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells). TREM-1 is selectively expressed on blood neutrophils and a subset of monocytes and is up-regulated by bacterial LPS. Engagement of TREM-1 triggers secretion of IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and TNF-alpha and induces neutrophil degranulation. Intracellularly, TREM-1 induces Ca2+ mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1 (ERK1), ERK2 and phospholipase C-gamma. To mediate activation, TREM-1 associates with the transmembrane adapter molecule DAP12. Thus, TREM-1 mediates activation of neutrophil and monocytes, and may have a predominant role in inflammatory responses.

acetylcholinester	AChE	Hydrophobic protein that copurifies with human brain acetylcholinesterase: amino acid sequence, genomic organization, and chromosomal localization. The mechanism of attachment of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to neuronal membranes in interneuronal synapses is poorly understood. We have isolated, sequenced, and cloned a hydrophobic protein that copurifies with AChE from human caudate nucleus and that we propose forms a part of a complex of membrane proteins attached to this enzyme. It is a short protein of 136 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 18 kDa. The sequence contains stretches of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids and two cysteine residues. Analysis of the genomic sequence reveals that the coding region is divided among five short exons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localizes the gene to chromosome 6p21.32-p21.2. Northern blot analysis shows that this gene is widely expressed in the brain with an expression pattern that parallels that of AChE.
None	Cas	Tyrosine dephosphorylation, but not phosphorylation, of p130Cas is dependent on integrin alpha IIb beta 3-mediated aggregation in platelets: implication of p130Cas involvement in pathways unrelated to cytoskeletal reorganization. The newly described adapter molecule p130 Crk-associated substrate (Cas) has been reported to contribute to cytoskeletal organization through assembly of actin filaments and to be pivotal in embryonic development and in oncogene-mediated transformation. We characterized the regulation of Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in highly differentiated, anucleate platelets. Phospholipase C-activating receptor agonists, including collagen, thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), and U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analogue), and A23187 (a Ca2+ ionophore) induced rapid Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, protein kinase C (PKC) activators, also induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, albeit sluggishly. Cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by collagen or TRAP was transient in aggregating platelets; Cas became dephosphorylated in a manner dependent on integrin alpha IIb beta 3-mediated aggregation. While BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca2+ chelator) inhibited Cas phosphorylation induced by collagen or TRAP, Ro31-8220 (a PKC inhibitor) rather prolonged it. Under the conditions, this PKC inhibitor suppressed platelet aggregation but not intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. In contrast to Cas involvement in focal adhesions in other cells, platelet Cas phosphorylation preceded the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and blockage of alpha IIb beta 3-mediated platelet aggregation with a GRGDS peptide resulted in prolongation of stimulation-dependent Cas tyrosine phosphorylation but in suppression of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, TRAP-induced Cas phosphorylation was insensitive to cytochalasin D, an actin polymerization inhibitor. The failure of FAK to associate with Cas in immunoprecipitation studies also suggests that Cas tyrosine phosphorylation is independent of FAK activation. Of the signaling molecules investigated in this study, Src seemed to associate with Cas. Finally, Cas existed mainly in cytosol and membrane cytoskeleton fractions in the resting state, and remained unchanged during platelet aggregation, when FAK translocated to the cytoskeletal fraction. Our findings on platelet Cas suggest that (i) rapid Cas tyrosine phosphorylation occurs following phosphoinositide turnover by receptor-mediated agonists and may be mediated by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization; (ii) PKC activation, by itself, may elicit sluggish Cas phosphorylation; (iii) Cas tyrosine dephosphorylation, but not phosphorylation, is dependent on integrin alpha IIb beta 3-mediated aggregation; and (iv) Cas is not involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Anucleate platelets seem to provide a unique model system to fully elucidate the functional role(s) of Cas.

c - jun amino - terminal	JNK	Activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. We previously reported that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces apoptosis via c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in HN33 cells (Liu, Y. F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28873-28822). Extending this study, we now demonstrate a role of mixed-lineage kinase 2 (MLK2), a JNK activator, in polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-mediated neuronal toxicity. We find that normal huntingtin interacts with MLK2, whereas the polyglutamine expansion interferes with this interaction. Similar to the expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, expression of MLK2 also induces JNK activation and apoptosis in HN33 cells. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 significantly attenuates neuronal apoptosis induced by the mutated huntingtin. Furthermore, over-expression of the N terminus of normal huntingtin partially rescues the neuronal toxicity induced by MLK2. Our results suggest that activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades may be partially involved in neuronal death induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin.

structural maintenance of chromosome	SMC3	Overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 causes transformation. Bamacan can occur in certain cell types as either a secreted proteoglycan assembled into basement membranes or as an intracellular protein known as structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3). To assess the role of this protein in tumorigenesis, we investigated whether induced overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 could transform normal fibroblasts. We generated a full-length cDNA encoding the entire mouse bamacan/SMC3 and demonstrated appropriate transcription and translation into a 146-kDa protein. All the NIH and Balb/c 3T3 murine fibroblasts overexpressing this bamacan/SMC3 transgene generated foci of transformation and acquired anchorage-independent growth. The increased levels of bamacan/SMC3 expression achieved in the transfected fibroblasts were the same as those detected in a series of spontaneously transformed murine and human colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, a 3-4-fold overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 was detected in approximately 70% of human colon carcinoma specimens from matched pairs (n = 19, p < 0.0002) and in a cohort of intestinal tumors from Apc-deficient Min/+ mice. These results support the concept that deregulated expression of bamacan/SMC3 is involved in cell transformation.
None	POBN	Myeloperoxidase is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis of HL-60 human leukemia cells. We examined the mechanism of H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity and its relationship to oxidation in human leukemia cells. The HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was sensitive to H(2)O(2), and at concentrations up to about 20-25 micrometer, the killing was mediated by apoptosis. There was limited evidence of lipid peroxidation, suggesting that the effects of H(2)O(2) do not involve hydroxyl radical. When HL-60 cells were exposed to H(2)O(2) in the presence of the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), we detected a 12-line electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum assigned to the POBN/POBN(.) N-centered spin adduct previously described in peroxidase-containing cell-free systems. Generation of this radical by HL-60 cells had the same H(2)O(2) concentration dependence as initiation of apoptosis. In contrast, studies with the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line, which is often used for comparison with the HL-60, and with high passaged HL-60 cells (spent HL-60) studied under the same conditions failed to generate POBN(.). Cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase did not explain the differences between these cell lines. Interestingly, the K562 and spent HL-60 cells, which did not generate the radical, also failed to undergo H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Based on this we reasoned that the difference in H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis might be due to the enzyme myeloperoxidase. Only the apoptosis-manifesting HL-60 cells contained appreciable immunoreactive protein or enzymatic activity of this cellular enzyme. When HL-60 cells were incubated with methimazole or 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, which are inhibitors of myeloperoxidase, they no longer underwent H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Hypochlorous acid stimulated apoptosis in both HL-60 and spent HL-60 cells, indicating that another oxidant generated by myeloperoxidase induces apoptosis and that it may be the direct mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Taken together these observations indicate that H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in the HL-60 human leukemia cell is mediated by myeloperoxidase and is linked to a non-Fenton oxidative event marked by POBN(.).
mapk upstream	MUK	MAPK upstream kinase (MUK)-binding inhibitory protein, a negative regulator of MUK/dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase/leucine zipper protein kinase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase upstream kinase/dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase/leucine-zipper protein kinase (MUK/DLK/ZPK) is a MAPKKK class protein kinase that induces JNK/SAPK activation. We report here a protein named MBIP that binds to MUK/DLK/ZPK. MUK-binding inhibitory protein (MBIP) contains two tandemly orientated leucine-zipper-like motifs with a cluster of basic amino acids located between the two motifs. MBIP interacts with one of the two leucine-zipper-like motifs of MUK/DLK/ZPK and inhibits the activity of MUK/DLK/ZPK to induce JNK/SAPK activation. Notably, no similar effect was observed with another JNK/SAPK-inducing MAPKKK, COT/Tpl-2, showing the specificity of MBIP action. Furthermore, the overexpression of MBIP partially inhibits the activation of JNK by 0.3 m sorbitol in 293T cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that MBIP can function as a regulator of MUK/DLK/ZPK, a finding that may provide a clue to understanding the molecular mechanism of JNK/SAPK activation by hyperosmotic stress.
muk - binding inhibitory	MBIP	MAPK upstream kinase (MUK)-binding inhibitory protein, a negative regulator of MUK/dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase/leucine zipper protein kinase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase upstream kinase/dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase/leucine-zipper protein kinase (MUK/DLK/ZPK) is a MAPKKK class protein kinase that induces JNK/SAPK activation. We report here a protein named MBIP that binds to MUK/DLK/ZPK. MUK-binding inhibitory protein (MBIP) contains two tandemly orientated leucine-zipper-like motifs with a cluster of basic amino acids located between the two motifs. MBIP interacts with one of the two leucine-zipper-like motifs of MUK/DLK/ZPK and inhibits the activity of MUK/DLK/ZPK to induce JNK/SAPK activation. Notably, no similar effect was observed with another JNK/SAPK-inducing MAPKKK, COT/Tpl-2, showing the specificity of MBIP action.

matrix	MMP-26	Identification and characterization of human endometase (Matrix metalloproteinase-26) from endometrial tumor. We report the discovery, cloning, and characterization of a novel human matrix metalloproteinase 26 (MMP-26) (matrixin) gene, endometase, an endometrial tumor-derived metalloproteinase. Among more than three million expressed sequence tags sequenced, the endometase gene was only obtained from human endometrial tumor cDNA library. Endometase mRNA was expressed specifically in human uterus, not in other tissues/cells tested, e.g. testis, heart, brain, lungs, liver, thymus, and melanoma G361. Endometase protein has a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and a catalytic domain with a unique " cysteine switch " propeptide sequence, PHCGVPDGSD, and a zinc-binding motif, VATHEIGHSLGLQH. Endometase is 43, 41, 41, and 39% identical to human metalloelastase, stromelysin, collagenase-3, and matrilysin, respectively. The zymogen was expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies with a molecular mass of 28 kDa. The identity and homogeneity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by protein N-terminal sequencing, silver stain, and immunoblot analyses. The pro-enzyme was partially activated during the folding process. Endometase selectively cleaved type I gelatin and alpha(1)-proteinase inhibitor; however, it did not digest collagens, laminin, elastin, beta-casein, plasminogen, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or Bowman-Birk inhibitor. It hydrolyzed peptide substrates of matrixins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme. Endometase may selectively cleave extracellular matrix proteins, inactivate serpins, and process cytokines.
hela dna polymerase	pol epsilon	Identification and cloning of two histone fold motif-containing subunits of HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon. HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon), possibly involved in both DNA replication and DNA repair, was previously isolated as a complex of a 261-kDa catalytic subunit and a tightly bound 59-kDa accessory protein. Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol epsilon, however, consists of four subunits: a 256-kDa catalytic subunit with 39% identity to HeLa pol epsilon p261, a 80-kDa subunit (DPB2) with 26% identity to HeLa pol epsilon p59, a 23-kDa subunit (DPB3), and a 22-kDa subunit (DPB4). We report here the identification and the cloning of two additional subunits of HeLa pol epsilon, p17, and p12. Both proteins contain histone fold motifs which are present also in S. cerevisiae DPB4 and DPB3. The histone fold motifs of p17 and DPB4 are related to that of subunit A of the CCAAT binding factor, whereas the histone fold motifs found in p12 and DPB3 are homologous to that in subunit C of CCAAT binding factor. p17 together with p12, but not p17 or p12 alone, interact with both p261 and p59 subunits of HeLa pol epsilon. The genes for p17 and p12 can be assigned to chromosome locations 9q33 and 2p12, respectively.
immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory	ITIM	Cloning, characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of siglec-9, a new member of the CD33-related group of siglecs. Evidence for co-evolution with sialic acid synthesis pathways. The Siglecs are a subfamily of I-type lectins (immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that bind sugars) that specifically recognize sialic acids. We report the cloning and characterization of human Siglec-9. The cDNA encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytosolic tail containing two tyrosines, one within a typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The N-terminal V-set Ig domain has most amino acid residues typical of Siglecs. Siglec-9 is expressed on granulocytes and monocytes. Expression of the full-length cDNA in COS cells induces sialic-acid dependent erythrocyte binding. A recombinant soluble form of the extracellular domain binds to alpha2-3 and alpha2-6-linked sialic acids. Typical of Siglecs, the carboxyl group and side chain of sialic acid are essential for recognition, and mutation of a critical arginine residue in domain 1 abrogates binding. The underlying glycan structure also affects binding, with Galbeta1-4Glc[NAc] being preferred. Siglec-9 shows closest homology to Siglec-7 and both belong to a Siglec-3/CD33-related subset of Siglecs (with Siglecs-5, -6, and -8). The Siglec-9 gene is on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4, in a cluster with all Siglec-3/CD33-related Siglec genes, suggesting their origin by gene duplications. A homology search of the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes suggests that Siglec expression may be limited to animals of deuterostome lineage, coincident with the appearance of the genes of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway.

mckusick - kaufman	MKKS	Mutation of a gene encoding a putative chaperonin causes McKusick-Kaufman syndrome. McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS, MIM 236700) is a human developmental anomaly syndrome comprising hydrometrocolpos (HMC), postaxial polydactyly (PAP) and congenital heart disease (CHD). MKKS has been mapped in the Old Order Amish population to 20p12, between D20S162 and D20S894 (ref. 3). Here we describe the identification of a gene mutated in MKKS. We analysed the approximately 450-kb candidate region by sample sequencing, which revealed the presence of several known genes and EST clusters. We evaluated candidate transcripts by northern-blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues. We selected one transcript with widespread expression, MKKS, for analysis in a patient from the Amish pedigree and a sporadic, non-Amish case. The Old Order Amish patient was found to be homozygous for an allele that had two missense substitutions and the non-Amish patient was a compound heterozygote for a frameshift mutation predicting premature protein truncation and a distinct missense mutation. The MKKS predicted protein shows amino acid similarity to the chaperonin family of proteins, suggesting a role for protein processing in limb, cardiac and reproductive system development. We believe that this is the first description of a human disorder caused by mutations affecting a putative chaperonin molecule.

small leucine - rich proteogly	SLRPs	Mutations in KERA, encoding keratocan, cause cornea plana. Specialized collagens and small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) interact to produce the transparent corneal structure. In cornea plana, the forward convex curvature is flattened, leading to a decrease in refraction. A more severe, recessively inherited form (CNA2; MIM 217300) and a milder, dominantly inherited form (CNA1; MIM 121400) exist. CNA2 is a rare disorder with a worldwide distribution, but a high prevalence in the Finnish population. The gene mutated in CNA2 was assigned by linkage analysis to 12q (refs 4, 5), where there is a cluster of several SLRP genes. We cloned two additional SLRP genes highly expressed in cornea: KERA (encoding keratocan) in 12q and OGN (encoding osteoglycin) in 9q. Here we report mutations in KERA in 47 CNA2 patients: 46 Finnish patients are homozygous for a founder missense mutation, leading to the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid; and one American patient is homozygous for a mutation leading to a premature stop codon that truncates the KERA protein. Our data establish that mutations in KERA cause CNA2. CNA1 patients had no mutations in these proteoglycan genes.

ataxia - telangiectas	A-T	ATM-dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure. Mutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1,2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS.

None	SOS	Phosphorylation of SOX9 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A enhances SOX9's ability to transactivate a Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer. Sox9 is a high-mobility-group domain-containing transcription factor required for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation. We used a yeast two-hybrid method based on Son of Sevenless (SOS) recruitment to screen a chondrocyte cDNA library and found that the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-Calpha) interacted specifically with SOX9. Next we found that two consensus PKA phosphorylation sites within SOX9 could be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and that SOX9 could be phosphorylated by PKA-Calpha in vivo. In COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKA-Calpha and SOX9 expression plasmids, PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type SOX9 but did not affect phosphorylation of a SOX9 protein in which the two PKA phosphorylation sites (S(64) and S(211)) were mutated. Using a phosphospecific antibody that specifically recognized SOX9 phosphorylated at serine 211, one of the two PKA phosphorylation sites, we demonstrated that addition of cAMP to chondrocytes strongly increased the phosphorylation of endogenous Sox9. In addition, immunohistochemistry of mouse embryo hind legs showed that Sox9 phosphorylated at serine 211 was principally localized in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate, corresponding to the major site of expression of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor. Since cAMP has previously been shown to effectively increase the mRNA levels of Col2a1 and other specific markers of chondrocyte differentiation in culture, we then asked whether PKA phosphorylation could modulate the activity of SOX9. Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to chondrocytes in culture increased the activity of a transiently transfected SOX9-dependent 48-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer; similarly, cotransfection of PKA-Calpha increased the activity of this enhancer. Mutations of the two PKA phosphorylation consensus sites of SOX9 markedly decreased the PKA-Calpha activation of this enhancer by SOX9. PKA phosphorylation and the mutations in the consensus PKA phosphorylation sites of SOX9 did not alter its nuclear localization. In vitro phosphorylation of SOX9 by PKA resulted in more efficient DNA binding. We conclude that SOX9 is a target of cAMP signaling and that phosphorylation of SOX9 by PKA enhances its transcriptional and DNA-binding activity. Because PTHrP signaling is mediated by cAMP, our results support the hypothesis that Sox9 is a target of PTHrP signaling in the growth plate and that the increased activity of Sox9 might mediate the effect of PTHrP in maintaining the cells as nonhypertrophic chondrocytes.

In COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKA-Calpha and SOX9 expression plasmids, PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type SOX9 but did not affect phosphorylation of a SOX9 protein in which the two PKA phosphorylation sites (S(64) and S(211)) were mutated. Using a phosphospecific antibody that specifically recognized SOX9 phosphorylated at serine 211, one of the two PKA phosphorylation sites, we demonstrated that addition of cAMP to chondrocytes strongly increased the phosphorylation of endogenous Sox9. In addition, immunohistochemistry of mouse embryo hind legs showed that Sox9 phosphorylated at serine 211 was principally localized in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate, corresponding to the major site of expression of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor. Since cAMP has previously been shown to effectively increase the mRNA levels of Col2a1 and other specific markers of chondrocyte differentiation in culture, we then asked whether PKA phosphorylation could modulate the activity of SOX9. Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to chondrocytes in culture increased the activity of a transiently transfected SOX9-dependent 48-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer; similarly, cotransfection of PKA-Calpha increased the activity of this enhancer. Mutations of the two PKA phosphorylation consensus sites of SOX9 markedly decreased the PKA-Calpha activation of this enhancer by SOX9. PKA phosphorylation and the mutations in the consensus PKA phosphorylation sites of SOX9 did not alter its nuclear localization. In vitro phosphorylation of SOX9 by PKA resulted in more efficient DNA binding. We conclude that SOX9 is a target of cAMP signaling and that phosphorylation of SOX9 by PKA enhances its transcriptional and DNA-binding activity. Because PTHrP signaling is mediated by cAMP, our results support the hypothesis that Sox9 is a target of PTHrP signaling in the growth plate and that the increased activity of Sox9 might mediate the effect of PTHrP in maintaining the cells as nonhypertrophic chondrocytes.
uracil - dna glycosyla	UDG	Uracil-DNA glycosylase-DNA substrate and product structures: conformational strain promotes catalytic efficiency by coupled stereoelectronic effects. Enzymatic transformations of macromolecular substrates such as DNA repair enzyme/DNA transformations are commonly interpreted primarily by active-site functional-group chemistry that ignores their extensive interfaces. Yet human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an archetypical enzyme that initiates DNA base-excision repair, efficiently excises the damaged base uracil resulting from cytosine deamination even when active-site functional groups are deleted by mutagenesis. The 1.8-A resolution substrate analogue and 2.0-A resolution cleaved product cocrystal structures of UDG bound to double-stranded DNA suggest enzyme-DNA substrate-binding energy from the macromolecular interface is funneled into catalytic power at the active site. The architecturally stabilized closing of UDG enforces distortions of the uracil and deoxyribose in the flipped-out nucleotide substrate that are relieved by glycosylic bond cleavage in the product complex. This experimentally defined substrate stereochemistry implies the enzyme alters the orientation of three orthogonal electron orbitals to favor electron transpositions for glycosylic bond cleavage. By revealing the coupling of this anomeric effect to a delocalization of the glycosylic bond electrons into the uracil aromatic system, this structurally implicated mechanism resolves apparent paradoxes concerning the transpositions of electrons among orthogonal orbitals and the retention of catalytic efficiency despite mutational removal of active-site functional groups. These UDG/DNA structures and their implied dissociative excision chemistry suggest biology favors a chemistry for base-excision repair initiation that optimizes pathway coordination by product binding to avoid the release of cytotoxic and mutagenic intermediates. Similar excision chemistry may apply to other biological reaction pathways requiring the coordination of complex multistep chemical transformations.
inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of	STAT	Distinct roles of the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 (PIAS1) in cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction. STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation on cytokine stimulation. A tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT forms a functional dimer through reciprocal Src homology 2 domain (SH2)-phosphotyrosyl peptide interactions. IFN treatment induces the association of PIAS1 and Stat1, which results in the inhibition of Stat1-mediated gene activation. The molecular basis of the cytokine-dependent PIAS1-Stat1 interaction has not been understood. We report here that a region near the COOH terminus of PIAS1 (amino acids 392-541) directly interacts with the NH(2)-terminal domain of Stat1 (amino acids 1-191). A mutant PIAS1 lacking the Stat1-interacting domain failed to inhibit Stat1-mediated gene activation. By using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that PIAS1 specifically interacts with the Stat1 dimer, but not tyrosine-phosphorylated or -unphosphorylated Stat1 monomer. In addition, whereas the NH(2)-terminal region of PIAS1 does not interact with Stat1, it serves as a modulatory domain by preventing the interaction of the COOH-terminal domain of PIAS1 with the Stat1 monomer. Thus, the cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction is mediated through the specific recognition of the dimeric form of Stat1 by PIAS1.
