the leukemic protein core binding factor	CBFbeta	The leukemic protein core binding factor beta (CBFbeta)-smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain sequesters CBFalpha2 into cytoskeletal filaments and aggregates
core binding factor	CBFbeta	The fusion gene CBFB-MYH11 is generated by the chromosome 16 inversion associated with acute myeloid leukemias. This gene encodes a chimeric protein involving the core binding factor beta (CBFbeta) and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC). Mouse model studies suggest that this chimeric protein CBFbeta-SMMHC dominantly suppresses the function of CBF, a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of DNA binding subunits (CBFalpha1 to 3) and a non-DNA binding subunit (CBFbeta). This dominant suppression results in the blockage of hematopoiesis in mice and presumably contributes to leukemogenesis. We used transient-transfection assays, in combination with immunofluorescence and green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins, to monitor subcellular localization of CBFbeta-SMMHC, CBFbeta, and CBFalpha2 (also known as AML1 or PEBP2alphaB). When expressed individually, CBFalpha2 was located in the nuclei of transfected cells, whereas CBFbeta was distributed throughout the cell. On the other hand, CBFbeta-SMMHC formed filament-like structures that colocalized with actin filaments. Upon cotransfection, CBFalpha2 was able to drive localization of CBFbeta into the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CBFalpha2 colocalized with CBFbeta-SMMHC along the filaments instead of localizing to the nucleus. Deletion of the CBFalpha-interacting domain within CBFbeta-SMMHC abolished this CBFalpha2 sequestration, whereas truncation of the C-terminal-end SMMHC domain led to nuclear localization of CBFbeta-SMMHC when coexpressed with CBFalpha2. CBFalpha2 sequestration by CBFbeta-SMMHC was further confirmed in vivo in a knock-in mouse model. These observations suggest that CBFbeta-SMMHC plays a dominant negative role by sequestering CBFalpha2 into cytoskeletal filaments and aggregates, thereby disrupting CBFalpha2-mediated regulation of gene expression.

pre - t cell	TCR	The role of the pre-T cell receptor (TCR) in lineage commitment to the gammadelta versus alphabeta lineage of T cells was addressed by analyzing TCRbeta chain rearrangements in gammadelta T cells from wild-type and pre-TCR-deficient mice by single cell polymerase chain reaction. Results show that the pre-TCR selects against gammadelta T cells containing rearranged Vbeta genes and that gammadelta T cell precursors but not gammadelta T cells express the pre-TCRalpha protein. Furthermore, pre-TCR-induced proliferation could not be detected in gammadelta T cells. We propose that the pre-TCR commits developing T cells to the alphabeta lineage by an instructive mechanism that has largely replaced an evolutionary more ancient stochastic mechanism of lineage commitment.
suprachiasmatic	SCN	A mouse gene, mper1, having all the properties expected of a circadian clock gene, was reported recently. This gene is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). mper1 maintains this pattern of circadian expression in constant darkness and can be entrained to a new light/dark cycle. Here we report the isolation of a second mammalian gene, mper2, which also has these properties and greater homology to Drosophila period. Expression of mper1 and mper2 is overlapping but asynchronous by 4 hr. mper1, unlike period and mper2, is expressed rapidly after exposure to light at CT22. It appears that mper1 is the pacemaker component which responds to light and thus mediates photic entrainment.
prefront	PF	The prefrontal (PF) cortex has been implicated in the remarkable ability of primates to form and rearrange arbitrary associations rapidly. This ability was studied in two monkeys, using a task that required them to learn to make specific saccades in response to particular cues and then repeatedly reverse these responses. We found that the activity of individual PF neurons represented both the cues and the associated responses, perhaps providing a neural substrate for their association. Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals' impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning. These results suggest a role for the PF cortex in learning arbitrary cue-response associations, an ability critical for complex behavior.
glial cell line - derived neurotrophic	GDNF	The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands (GDNF, Neurturin [NTN], and Persephin [PSP]) signal through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a high-affinity binding component (GFRalpha1-GFRalpha4) and a common signaling component (RET). Here, we report the identification of Artemin, a novel member of the GDNF family, and demonstrate that it is the ligand for the former orphan receptor GFRalpha3-RET. Artemin is a survival factor for sensory and sympathetic neurons in culture, and its expression pattern suggests that it also influences these neurons in vivo. Artemin can also activate the GFRalpha1-RET complex and supports the survival of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in culture, indicating that like GDNF (GFRalpha1-RET) and NTN (GFRalpha2-RET), Artemin has a preferred receptor (GFRalpha3-RET) but that alternative receptor interactions also occur.

head	HD	We recorded head direction (HD) cells from the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN) and anterior thalamus (ATN) of freely behaving rats and also made bilateral lesions of LMN while recording HD cells from ATN. We discovered that the tuning functions of LMN HD cells become narrower during contraversive head turns, but not ipsiversive head turns, compared to when the head is not turning. This narrowing effect does not occur for ATN HD cells. We also found that the HD signal in LMN leads that in ATN by about 15-20 ms. When LMN was lesioned bilaterally, HD cells in ATN immediately lost their directional firing properties and never recovered them. Based on these findings, we argue that LMN may be an essential component of an attractor-integrator network that participates in generating the HD signal.

fas	FasL	Fas (CD95) and Fas ligand (FasL) play major roles in staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced peripheral deletion of Vbeta8+ T cells. We found that peripheral deletion was defective in radiation chimeras with non-functional tissue FasL, regardless of the FasL status of the bone marrow-derived cells. SEB induced a dramatic upregulation of FasL expression and function in nonlymphoid cells of liver and small intestine. This effect was resistant to inhibition by cyclosporin A, which also failed to inhibit peripheral deletion. In SCID animals nonlymphoid tissues did not express FasL in response to SEB unless transplanted lymphocytes were present. Thus, some immune responses induce FasL in nonlymphoid tissues, which in turn kills activated lymphocytes, leading to peripheral T cell deletion.

immunofluorescence in situ hybrid	immuno-FISH	Ikaros proteins are required for normal T, B, and NK cell development and are postulated to activate lymphocyte-specific gene expression. Here we examined Ikaros distribution in the nucleus of B lymphocytes using confocal microscopy and a novel immunofluorescence in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH) approach. Unexpectedly, Ikaros localized to discrete heterochromatin-containing foci in interphase nuclei, which comprise clusters of centromeric DNA as defined by gamma-satellite sequences and the abundance of heterochromatin protein-1 (HP-1). Using locus-specific probes for CD2, CD4, CD8alpha, CD19, CD45, and lambda5 genes, we show that transcriptionally inactive but not transcriptionally active genes associate with Ikaros-heterochromatin foci. These findings support a model of organization of the nucleus in which repressed genes are selectively recruited into centromeric domains.

t cell antigen	TCR	Tyrosine phosphorylation of linker proteins enables the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-associated protein tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate and regulate effector molecules that generate second messengers. We demonstrate here that the SLP-76 linker protein interacts with both nck, an adaptor protein, and Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho-family GTPases. The assembly of this tri-molecular complex permits the activated Rho-family GTPases to regulate target effectors that interact through nck. In turn, assembly of this complex mediates the enzymatic activation of the p21-activated protein kinase 1 and facilitates actin polymerization. Hence, phosphorylation of linker proteins not only bridges the TCR-associated PTK, ZAP-70, with downstream effector proteins, but also provides a scaffold to integrate distinct signaling complexes to regulate T cell function.
ccaat / enhancer binding	C/EBP	Members of the C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) family of transcription factors play important roles in mediating the acute-phase response (APR), an inflammatory process resulting from infection and/or tissue damage. Among the C/EBP family of proteins, C/EBPbeta and -delta were thought to be the primary mediators of the APR. The function of C/EBPalpha in the APR has not been fully characterized to date. Here, we investigate the role of C/EBPalpha in the APR by using neonatal mice that lack C/EBPalpha expression. Northern blot analysis of acute-phase protein gene expression in neonatal mice treated with purified bacterial lipopolysaccharide or recombinant interleukin 1beta as an inflammation stimulus showed a strong APR in wild-type mice, but a response in C/EBPalpha null animals was completely lacking. The C/EBPalpha knockout and wild-type mice demonstrated elevations in C/EBPbeta and -delta mRNA expression and DNA binding as well as increased DNA binding of NF-kappaB, all of which are known to be important in the APR. Null mice, however, failed to activate STAT3 binding in response to lipopolysaccharide. Our results provide the first evidence that C/EBPalpha is absolutely required for the APR in neonatal mice, is involved in STAT3 regulation, and cannot be compensated for by other C/EBP family members.

lymphocytic choriomeningitis	LCMV	A peripheral membrane protein that is interactive with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was purified from cells permissive to infection. Tryptic peptides from this protein were determined to be alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG). Several strains of LCMV and other arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus (LFV), Oliveros, and Mobala, bound to purified alpha-DG protein. Soluble alpha-DG blocked both LCMV and LFV infection. Cells bearing a null mutation of the gene encoding DG were resistant to LCMV infection, and reconstitution of DG expression in null mutant cells restored susceptibility to LCMV infection. Thus, alpha-DG is a cellular receptor for both LCMV and LFV.

sc	l'sc	Mesodermal progenitors arise in the Drosophila embryo from discrete clusters of lethal of scute (l'sc)-expressing cells. Using both genetic loss-of-function and targeted ectopic expression approaches, we demonstrate here that individual progenitors are specified by the sequential deployment of unique combinations of intercellular signals. Initially, the intersection between the Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) expression domains demarcate an ectodermal prepattern that is imprinted on the adjacent mesoderm in the form of a L'sc precluster. All mesodermal cells within this precluster are competent to respond to a subsequent instructive signal mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER) and the Heartless (Htl) fibroblast growth factor receptor. By monitoring the expression of the diphosphorylated form of mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK), we found that these RTKs are activated in small clusters of cells within the original competence domain. Each cluster represents an equivalence group because all members initially resemble progenitors in their expression of both L'sc and mesodermal identity genes. Thus, localized RTK activity induces the formation of mesodermal equivalence groups. The RTKs remain active in the single progenitor that emerges from each cluster under the subsequent inhibitory influence of the neurogenic genes. Moreover, DER and Htl are differentially involved in the specification of particular progenitors. We conclude that distinct cellular identity codes are generated by the combinatorial activities of Wg, Dpp, EGF, and FGF signals in the progressive determination of embryonic mesodermal cells.

melanocortin - 5	MC5-R	The effects of pituitary-derived melanocortin peptides are primarily attributed to ACTH-mediated adrenocortical glucocorticoid production. Identification of a widely distributed receptor for ACTH/MSH peptides, the melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5-R), suggested non-steroidally mediated systemic effects of these peptides. Targeted disruption of the MC5-R produced mice with a severe defect in water repulsion and thermoregulation due to decreased production of sebaceous lipids. High levels of MC5-R was found in multiple exocrine tissues, including Harderian, preputial, lacrimal, and sebaceous glands, and was also shown to be required for production and stress-regulated synthesis of porphyrins by the Harderian gland and ACTH/MSH-regulated protein secretion by the lacrimal gland. These data show a requirement for the MC5-R in multiple exocrine glands for the production of numerous products, indicative of a coordinated system for regulation of exocrine gland function by melanocortin peptides.
drosophila grou	Gro	The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein is a corepressor required by a number of DNA-binding transcriptional repressors. Comparison of Gro with its homologues in other eukaryotic organisms reveals that Gro contains, in addition to a conserved C-terminal WD repeat domain, a conserved N-terminal domain, which has previously been implicated in transcriptional repression. We determined, via a variety of hydrodynamic measurements as well as protein cross-linking, that native Gro is a tetramer in solution and that tetramerization is mediated by two putative amphipathic alpha-helices (termed leucine zipper-like motifs) found in the N-terminal region. Point mutations in the leucine zipper-like motifs that block tetramerization also block repression by Gro, as assayed in cultured Drosophila cells with Gal4-Gro fusion proteins. Furthermore, the heterologous tetramerization domain from p53 fully substitutes for the Gro tetramerization domain in transcriptional repression. These findings suggest that oligomerization is essential for Gro-mediated repression and that the primary function of the conserved N-terminal domain is to mediate this oligomerization.
hippocampal long - term potent	LTP	Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are the most widely studied forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie spatial learning and memory. We report here that RARbeta deficiency in mice virtually eliminates hippocampal CA1 LTP and LTD. It also results in substantial performance deficits in spatial learning and memory tasks. Surprisingly, RXRgamma null mice exhibit a distinct phenotype in which LTD is lost whereas LTP is normal. Thus, while retinoid receptors contribute to both LTP and LTD, they do so in different ways. These findings not only genetically uncouple LTP and LTD but also reveal a novel and unexpected role for vitamin A in higher cognitive functions.

prion	PrP	Familial prion diseases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP). We have produced transgenic mice that express the mouse homolog of a mutant human PrP containing a nine octapeptide insertion associated with prion dementia. These mice exhibit a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized clinically by ataxia and neuropathologically by cerebellar atrophy and granule cell loss, gliosis, and PrP deposition that is most prominent in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Mutant PrP molecules expressed in the brains of these mice are resistant to digestion by low concentrations of proteinase K and display several other biochemical properties reminiscent of PrP(Sc), the pathogenic isoform of PrP. These results establish a new transgenic animal model of an inherited human prion disorder.
germ - line stem	GSCs	Germ-line stem cells (GSCs) serve as the source for gametogenesis in diverse organisms. We cloned and characterized the Drosophila piwi gene and showed that it is required for the asymmetric division of GSCs to produce and maintain a daughter GSC but is not essential for the further differentiation of the committed daughter cell. Genetic mosaic and RNA in situ analyses suggest that piwi expression in adjacent somatic cells regulates GSC division. piwi encodes a highly basic novel protein, well conserved during evolution. We isolated piwi homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans and also identified Arabidopsis piwi-like genes known to be required for meristem cell maintenance. Decreasing C. elegans piwi expression reduces the proliferation of GSC-equivalent cells. Thus, piwi represents a novel class of genes required for GSC division in diverse organisms.

We identified the mutated gene as the putative transcriptional activator and ATPase/DNA helicase previously described as Smbp2, Rip1, Gf1, or Catf1. Mutations were found in two alleles-a single amino acid deletion in nmdJ and a splice donor mutation in nmd2J. The selective vulnerability of motor neurons is striking in view of the widespread expression of this gene, although the pattern of degeneration may reflect a specific threshold since neither allele is null. In addition, the severity of the nmd phenotype is attenuated in a semidominant fashion by a major genetic locus on chromosome (Chr) 13. The identification of the nmd gene and mapping of a major suppressor provide new opportunities for understanding mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.
candidate boundary	cBEs	Boundary elements are thought to define the ends of functionally independent domains of genetic activity. An assay for boundary activity based on this concept measures the ability to insulate a bracketed, chromosomally integrated reporter gene from position effects. Despite their presumed importance, the few examples identified to date apparently do not share sequence motifs or DNA binding proteins. The Drosophila protein BEAF binds the scs' boundary element of the 87A7 hsp70 locus and roughly half of polytene chromosome interband loci. To see if these sites represent a class of boundary elements that have BEAF in common, we have isolated and studied several genomic BEAF binding sites as candidate boundary elements (cBEs). BEAF binds with high affinity to clustered, variably arranged CGATA motifs present in these cBEs. No other sequence homologies were found. Two cBEs were tested and found to confer position-independent expression on a mini-white reporter gene in transgenic flies. Furthermore, point mutations in CGATA motifs that eliminate binding by BEAF also eliminate the ability to confer position-independent expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that clustered CGATA motifs are a hallmark of a BEAF-utilizing class of boundary elements found at many loci. This is the first example of a class of boundary elements that share a sequence motif and a binding protein.
guanine - nucleotide - exchange	GEF	Rap1 is a small, Ras-like GTPase that was first identified as a protein that could suppress the oncogenic transformation of cells by Ras. Rap1 is activated by several extracellular stimuli and may be involved in cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, T-cell anergy and platelet activation. At least three different second messengers, namely diacylglycerol, calcium and cyclic AMP, are able to activate Rap1 by promoting its release of the guanine nucleotide GDP and its binding to GTP. Here we report that activation of Rap1 by forskolin and cAMP occurs independently of protein kinase A (also known as cAMP-activated protein kinase). We have cloned the gene encoding a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) which we have named Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP). This protein contains a cAMP-binding site and a domain that is homologous to domains of known GEFs for Ras and Rap1. Epac binds cAMP in vitro and exhibits in vivo and in vitro GEF activity towards Rap1. cAMP strongly induces the GEF activity of Epac towards Rap1 both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that Epac is a GEF for Rap1 that is regulated directly by cAMP and that Epac is a new target protein for cAMP.

syk kinases - interacting	SKIPs	Syk-family tyrosine kinases are essential for lymphocyte development and activation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Syk kinases-interacting proteins (SKIPs), we isolated 3BP2, an Abl SH3-interacting protein of unknown function. 3BP2 was selectively expressed in hematopoietic/lymphoid tissues and bound via its SH2 domain activated Syk-family kinases in mammalian cells, including in antigen receptor-stimulated T cells. In addition to Zap-70, the 3BP2 SH2 domain associated in vitro with LAT, Grb2, PLCgamma1, and Cbl from activated T cell lysates. Transient 3BP2 overexpression induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and its NFAT or AP-1 elements. This activity was dependent on the SH2 and pleckstrin-homology domains of 3BP2, and required functional Syk kinases, Ras, and calcineurin. Thus, 3BP2 is an important adaptor that may couple activated Zap-70/Syk to a LAT-containing signaling complex involved in TCR-mediated gene transcription.
c - jun nh2 - terminal	JNK	The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway has been implicated in the immune response that is mediated by the activation and differentiation of CD4 helper T (TH) cells into TH1 and TH2 effector cells. JNK activity observed in wild-type activated TH cells was severely reduced in TH cells from Jnk1-/- mice. The Jnk1-/- T cells hyperproliferated, exhibited decreased activation-induced cell death, and preferentially differentiated to TH2 cells. The enhanced production of TH2 cytokines by Jnk1-/- cells was associated with increased nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NFATc. Thus, the JNK1 signaling pathway plays a key role in T cell receptor-initiated TH cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.
rna polymerase ii subunit	RPB5	To modulate transcription, regulatory factors communicate with basal transcription factors and/or RNA polymerases in a variety of ways. Previously, it has been reported that RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5) is one of the targets of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and that both HBx and RPB5 specifically interact with general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), implying that RPB5 is one of the communicating subunits of RNA polymerase II involved in transcriptional regulation. In this context, we screened for a host protein(s) that interacts with RPB5. By far-Western blot screening, we cloned a novel gene encoding a 508-amino-acid-residue RPB5-binding protein from a HepG2 cDNA library and designated it RPB5-mediating protein (RMP). Expression of RMP mRNA was detected ubiquitously in various tissues. Bacterially expressed recombinant RMP strongly bound RPB5 but neither HBx nor TATA-binding protein in vitro. Endogenous RMP was immunologically detected interacting with assembled RPB5 in RNA polymerase in mammalian cells. The central part of RMP is responsible for RPB5 binding, and the RMP-binding region covers both the TFIIB- and HBx-binding sites of RPB5. Overexpression of RMP, but not mutant RMP lacking the RPB5-binding region, inhibited HBx transactivation of reporters with different HBx-responsive cis elements in transiently transfected cells. The repression by RMP was counteracted by HBx in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, RMP has an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activation by VP16 in the absence of HBx. These results suggest that RMP negatively modulates RNA polymerase II function by binding to RPB5 and that HBx counteracts the negative role of RMP on transcription indirectly by interacting with RPB5.

highly active antiretroviral	HAART	The thymus represents the major site of the production and generation of T cells expressing alphabeta-type T-cell antigen receptors. Age-related involution may affect the ability of the thymus to reconstitute T cells expressing CD4 cell-surface antigens that are lost during HIV infection; this effect has been seen after chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation. Adult HIV-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) show a progressive increase in their number of naive CD4-positive T cells. These cells could arise through expansion of existing naive T cells in the periphery or through thymic production of new naive T cells. Here we quantify thymic output by measuring the excisional DNA products of TCR-gene rearrangement. We find that, although thymic function declines with age, substantial output is maintained into late adulthood. HIV infection leads to a decrease in thymic function that can be measured in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. In adults treated with HAART, there is a rapid and sustained increase in thymic output in most subjects. These results indicate that the adult thymus can contribute to immune reconstitution following HAART.
retrochiasmatic	RCA	The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin decreases body weight in part by activating the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure. We investigated hypothalamic pathways underlying leptin's effects on stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. We found that leptin activates neurons in the retrochiasmatic area (RCA) and lateral arcuate nucleus (Arc) that innervate the thoracic spinal cord and also contain cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). We also found that most CART-containing neurons in the RCA and Arc of the hypothalamus also contain proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA. The finding that leptin activates CART/POMC neurons innervating sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracic spinal cord suggests that this pathway may contribute to the increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure and decreased body weight observed following leptin administration.

dorsal lateral geniculate	dLGN	Visual connections to the mammalian forebrain are known to be patterned by neural activity, but it remains unknown whether the map topography of such higher sensory projections depends on axon guidance labels. Here, we show complementary expression and binding for the receptor EphA5 in mouse retina and its ligands ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 in multiple retinal targets, including the major forebrain target, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). These ligands can act in vitro as topographically specific repellents for mammalian retinal axons and are necessary for normal dLGN mapping in vivo. The results suggest a general and economic modular mechanism for brain mapping whereby a projecting field is mapped onto multiple targets by repeated use of the same labels. They also indicate the nature of a coordinate system for the mapping of sensory connections to the forebrain.
	dsf	The dissatisfaction (dsf) gene is necessary for appropriate sexual behavior and sex-specific neural development in both sexes. dsf males are bisexual and mate poorly, while mutant females resist male courtship and fail to lay eggs. Males and females have sex-specific neural abnormalities. We have cloned dsf and rescued both behavioral and neural phenotypes. dsf encodes a nuclear receptor closely related to the vertebrate Tailless proteins and is expressed in both sexes in an extremely limited set of neurons in regions of the brain potentially involved in sexual behavior. Expression of a female transformer cDNA under the control of a dsf enhancer in males leads to dsf-like bisexual behavior.
periventricular heterotop	PH	Long-range, directed migration is particularly dramatic in the cerebral cortex, where postmitotic neurons generated deep in the brain migrate to form layers with distinct form and function. In the X-linked dominant human disorder periventricular heterotopia (PH), many neurons fail to migrate and persist as nodules lining the ventricular surface. Females with PH present with epilepsy and other signs, including patent ductus arteriosus and coagulopathy, while hemizygous males die embryonically. We have identified the PH gene as filamin 1 (FLN1), which encodes an actin-cross-linking phosphoprotein that transduces ligand-receptor binding into actin reorganization, and which is required for locomotion of many cell types. FLN1 shows previously unrecognized, high-level expression in the developing cortex, is required for neuronal migration to the cortex, and is essential for embryogenesis.

nuclear export	NES	The MDM2 oncoprotein targets the p53 tumor suppressor protein for degradation when the two proteins are expressed in cells. The regulation of p53 levels by MDM2 requires the ability of MDM2 to be exported from the nucleus by utilizing its nuclear export signal (NES). The drug leptomycin B (LMB) blocks the formation of nuclear export complexes consisting of CRM1, RanGTP, and NES-containing proteins. It is predicted that LMB should inhibit nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling by MDM2 and subsequently stabilize p53. This communication demonstrates that LMB treatment of various cell lines led to an increase in the steady-state levels of the p53 protein as a result of an increase in its stability. The stabilized p53 protein localized to the nucleus and was an active transcription factor. These results indicate that the low steady-state levels of p53 in the absence of DNA damage result from p53's nuclear export for cytoplasmic degradation. LMB also led to p53 stabilization in cell lines that contain human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and express HPV E6, a protein that targets p53 for degradation. MDM2 is not necessary for E6-dependent degradation of p53, as evidenced by the observation that E6 promoted p53 degradation in cells lacking endogenous MDM2. In addition, LMB reduced E6's ability to degrade p53 in the absence of MDM2, demonstrating that complete degradation of p53 by E6 requires nuclear export and therefore likely occurs in cytoplasmic proteasomes. These data suggest that the nuclear export of p53 to the cytoplasm for degradation is a general mechanism for regulating p53 levels.

ampa	AMPARs	We have used the synapses that isolated hippocampal cells in culture form onto themselves (autapses) to determine if some synapses lack functional AMPA receptors (AMPARs). A comparison of the synaptic variability of the AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated evoked responses, as well as of miniature synaptic responses, indicates that a population of events exists that only contains an NMDAR component. Spillover of glutamate from adjacent synapses cannot explain these results because in single cell cultures all synaptic events mediated by AMPARs should be detected. Immunocytochemical analysis of these cultures clearly reveals a population of synapses with puncta for NR1 (NMDAR) but not for GluR1 (AMPAR). These results provide strong anatomical and physiological evidence for the existence of postsynaptically silent synapses.
myosin heavy	MHC	The expression of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene is restricted primarily to cardiac myocytes. To date, several positive regulatory elements and their binding factors involved in alpha-MHC gene regulation have been identified; however, the mechanism restricting the expression of this gene to cardiac myocytes has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we have identified by using sequential deletion mutants of the rat cardiac alpha-MHC gene a 30-bp purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element located in the first intronic region that appeared to be essential for the tissue-specific expression of the alpha-MHC gene. Removal of this element alone elevated (20- to 30-fold) the expression of the alpha-MHC gene in cardiac myocyte cultures and in heart muscle directly injected with plasmid DNA. Surprisingly, this deletion also allowed a significant expression of the alpha-MHC gene in HeLa and other nonmuscle cells, where it is normally inactive. The PNR element required upstream sequences of the alpha-MHC gene for negative gene regulation. By DNase I footprint analysis of the PNR element, a palindrome of two high-affinity Ets-binding sites (CTTCCCTGGAAG) was identified. Furthermore, by analyses of site-specific base-pair mutation, mobility gel shift competition, and UV cross-linking, two different Ets-like proteins from cardiac and HeLa cell nuclear extracts were found to bind to the PNR motif. Moreover, the activity of the PNR-binding factor was found to be increased two- to threefold in adult rat hearts subjected to pressure overload hypertrophy, where the alpha-MHC gene is usually suppressed. These data demonstrate that the PNR element plays a dual role, both downregulating the expression of the alpha-MHC gene in cardiac myocytes and silencing the muscle gene activity in nonmuscle cells. Similar palindromic Ets-binding motifs are found conserved in the alpha-MHC genes from different species and in other cardiac myocyte-restricted genes. These results are the first to reveal a role of the Ets class of proteins in controlling the tissue-specific expression of a cardiac muscle gene.

epidermal growth factor	EGFR	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is amplified or mutated in 30%-50% of human gliobastoma multiforme (GBM). These mutations are associated usually with deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus, which encodes two gene products (p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF)) involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We have investigated the role of EGFR mutation in gliomagenesis, using avian retroviral vectors to transfer a mutant EGFR gene to glial precursors and astrocytes in transgenic mice expressing tv-a, a gene encoding the retrovirus receptor. TVA, under control of brain cell type-specific promoters. We demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active, mutant form of EGFR in cells in the glial lineage can induce lesions with many similarities to human gliomas. These lesions occur more frequently with gene transfer to mice expressing tv-a from the progenitor-specific nestin promoter than to mice expressing tv-a from the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, suggesting that tumors arise more efficiently from immature cells in the glial lineage. Furthermore, EGFR-induced gliomagenesis appears to require additional mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle arrest pathways. We have produced these combinations by simultaneously infecting tv-a transgenic mice with vectors carrying cdk4 and EGFR or by infecting tv-a transgenic mice bearing a disrupted INK4a-ARF locus with the EGFR-carrying vector alone. Moreover, EGFR-induced gliomagenesis does not occur in conjunction with p53 deficiency, unless the mice are also infected with a vector carrying cdk4. The gliomagenic combinations of genetic lesions required in mice are similar to those found in human gliomas.

These lesions occur more frequently with gene transfer to mice expressing tv-a from the progenitor-specific nestin promoter than to mice expressing tv-a from the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, suggesting that tumors arise more efficiently from immature cells in the glial lineage. Furthermore, EGFR-induced gliomagenesis appears to require additional mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle arrest pathways. We have produced these combinations by simultaneously infecting tv-a transgenic mice with vectors carrying cdk4 and EGFR or by infecting tv-a transgenic mice bearing a disrupted INK4a-ARF locus with the EGFR-carrying vector alone. Moreover, EGFR-induced gliomagenesis does not occur in conjunction with p53 deficiency, unless the mice are also infected with a vector carrying cdk4. The gliomagenic combinations of genetic lesions required in mice are similar to those found in human gliomas.
rna polymerase	Pol II	The Elongin BC complex was identified initially as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation factor Elongin A and subsequently as a component of the multiprotein von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex, in which it participates in both tumor suppression and negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes. Elongin B is a ubiquitin-like protein, and Elongin C is a Skp1-like protein that binds to a BC-box motif that is present in both Elongin A and VHL and is distinct from the conserved F-box motif recognized by Skp1. In this report, we demonstrate that the Elongin BC complex also binds to a functional BC box present in the SOCS box, a sequence motif identified recently in the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) protein, as well as in a collection of additional proteins belonging to the SOCS, ras, WD-40 repeat, SPRY domain, and ankyrin repeat families. In addition, we present evidence (1) that the Elongin BC complex is a component of a multiprotein SOCS-1 complex that attenuates Jak/STAT signaling by binding to Jak2 and inhibiting Jak2 kinase, and (2) that by interacting with the SOCS box, the Elongin BC complex can increase expression of the SOCS-1 protein by inhibiting its degradation. These results suggest that Elongin BC is a multifunctional regulatory complex capable of controlling multiple pathways in the cell through interaction with a short degenerate sequence motif found in many different proteins.

camp - dependent protein kinase	PKA	cAMP (3',5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger that in eukaryotic cells induces physiological responses ranging from growth, differentiation, and gene expression to secretion and neurotransmission. Most of these effects have been attributed to the binding of cAMP to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Here, a family of cAMP-binding proteins that are differentially distributed in the mammalian brain and body organs and that exhibit both cAMP-binding and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains is reported. These cAMP-regulated GEFs (cAMP-GEFs) bind cAMP and selectively activate the Ras superfamily guanine nucleotide binding protein Rap1A in a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent manner. Our findings suggest the need to reformulate concepts of cAMP-mediated signaling to include direct coupling to Ras superfamily signaling.

class switch recombina	CSR	We describe a model system for class switch recombination (CSR) using CH12F3-2 cells transfected with a DNA construct containing two S sequences transcribed by different promoters and separated by a viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Recombination observed using this system shares key properties with physiological CSR: deletion of DNA between two S regions, requirement for cytokine stimulation, and nonhomologous and no consensus breakpoint sequences. Studies on transfectants with variants of this construct led us to the following conclusions: (1) two S sequences are required for CSR; (2) isotype specificity of recombination is not determined by nucleotide sequences of S regions; (3) S sequences are not strand-specific; and (4) induction of recombination activity requires cytokine stimulation.

rna polymerase	Pol I	Saccharomyces cerevisiae carries approximately 150 copies of rDNA in tandem repeats. It was found that the absence of an essential subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in rpa135 deletion mutants triggers a gradual decrease in rDNA repeat number to about one-half the normal level. Reintroduction of the missing RPA135 gene induced a gradual increase in repeat number back to the normal level. Gene FOB1 was shown to be essential for both the decrease and increase of rDNA repeats. FOB1 was shown previously to be required for replication fork blocking (RFB) activity at RFB site in rDNA and for recombination hot-spot (HOT1) activity. Thus, DNA replication fork blockage appears to stimulate recombination and play an essential role in rDNA expansion/contraction and sequence homogenization, and possibly, in the instability of repeated sequences in general. RNA Pol I, on the other hand, appears to control repeat numbers, perhaps by stabilizing rDNA with the normal repeat numbers as a stable nucleolar structure.

mitogen - activated	MAP	The M26 meiotic recombination hot spot in the ade6 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is activated by the heterodimeric M26 binding protein Mts1-Mts2. The individual Mts1 (Atf1, Gad7) and Mts2 (Pcr1) proteins are also transcription factors involved in developmental decisions. We report that the Mts proteins are key effectors of at least two distinct classes of developmental decisions regulated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. The first class (osmoregulation, spore viability, and spore quiescence) requires the Spc1 MAP kinase and the Mts1 protein but does not require the Mts2 protein. The second class (mating, meiosis, and recombination hot spot activation) requires the Spc1 kinase and the Mts1-Mts2 heterodimer. Northern and Western blotting eliminated any significant role for the Spc1 kinase in regulating the expression levels of the Mts proteins. Gel mobility shift experiments indicated that the Mts1-Mts2 heterodimer does not need to be phosphorylated to bind to ade6-M26 DNA in vitro. However, in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting demonstrated that protein-DNA interaction within cells is dependent upon the Spc1 MAP kinase, which phosphorylates the Mts1 protein. Thus, the Spc1 kinase helps regulate the effector activities of the Mts1-Mts2 heterodimer in part by modulating its ability to occupy the M26 DNA site in vivo. Meiotic recombination hot spot function is likely the result of DNA conformational changes imparted by binding of the Mts1-Mts2 meiotic transcription factor.
basic helix - loop -	bHLH	We have generated a mouse bearing a null allele of the gene encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein p48, the cell-specific DNA-binding subunit of hetero-oligomeric transcription factor PTF1 that directs the expression of genes in the exocrine pancreas. The null mutation, which establishes a lethal condition shortly after birth, leads to a complete absence of exocrine pancreatic tissue and its specific products, indicating that p48 is required for differentiation and/or proliferation of the exocrine cell lineage. p48 is so far the only developmental regulator known to be required exclusively for committing cells to an exocrine fate. The hormone secreting cells of all four endocrine lineages are present in the mesentery that normally harbors the pancreatic organ until day 16 of gestation. Toward the end of embryonic life, cells expressing endocrine functions are no longer detected at their original location but are now found to colonize the spleen, where they persist in a functional state until postnatal death of the organism occurs. These findings suggest that the presence of the exocrine pancreas is required for the correct spatial assembly of the endocrine pancreas and that, in its absence, endocrine cells are directed by default to the spleen, a site that, in some reptiles, harbors part of this particular cellular compartment.
superantigen	SAGs	Superantigens (SAGs) are a class of immunostimulatory proteins of bacterial or viral origin that activate T cells by binding to the V beta domain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The three-dimensional structure of the complex between a TCR beta chain (mouse V beta8.2) and the SAG staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) at 2.4 A resolution reveals why SEB recognizes only certain V beta families, as well as why only certain SAGs bind mouse V beta8.2. Models of the TCR-SEB-peptide/MHC class II complex indicate that V alpha interacts with the MHC beta chain in the TCR-SAG-MHC complex. The extent of the interaction is variable and is largely determined by the geometry of V alpha/V beta domain association. This variability can account for the preferential expression of certain V alpha regions among T cells reactive with SEB.

il - 15 receptor alpha	IL-15Ralpha	The IL-15 receptor alpha subunit (IL-15Ralpha) mediates high-affinity binding of IL-15, a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in the development of innate immune cells. We have generated IL-15Ralpha null (IL-15Ralpha-/-) mice to understand the role of IL-15Ralpha in immune development and function. IL-15Ralpha-/- mice are markedly lymphopenic despite grossly normal T and B lymphocyte development. This lymphopenia is due to decreased proliferation and decreased homing of IL-15Ralpha-/- lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes. These mice are also deficient in natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and TCRgammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes. In addition, memory phenotype CD8+ T cells are selectively reduced in number. Thus, IL-15Ralpha has pleiotropic roles in immune development and function, including the positive maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis.

signal transducer and activator of	STAT	The action of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein on host immune-response genes has been attributed to interaction with p300/CBP-type transcriptional coactivators in competition with endogenous transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. However, we show that mutant forms of E1A that no longer bind p300/CBP can still interact directly with Stat1 (via E1A N-terminal and Stat1 C-terminal residues) and block IFNgamma-driven, Stat1-dependent gene activation and consequent function during early-phase infection in the natural host cell. The results provide a distinct and more specific mechanism for E1A-mediated immune suppression and an alternative model of IFNgamma-driven enhanceosome formation that may allow for other adaptors (in addition to p300/CBP) to link Stat1 to the basal transcription complex.
mitogen - activated protein	MAPK	Filamentous invasive growth of S. cerevisiae requires multiple elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade that are also components of the mating pheromone response pathway. Here we show that, despite sharing several constituents, the two pathways use different MAP kinases. The Fus3 MAPK regulates mating, whereas the Kss1 MAPK regulates filamentation and invasion. Remarkably, in addition to their kinase-dependent activation functions, Kss1 and Fus3 each have a distinct kinase-independent inhibitory function. Kss1 inhibits the filamentation pathway by interacting with its target transcription factor Ste12. Fus3 has a different inhibitory activity that prevents the inappropriate activation of invasion by the pheromone response pathway. In the absence of Fus3, there is erroneous crosstalk in which mating pheromone now activates filamentation-specific gene expression using the Kss1 MAPK.
glucocorticoid	GR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbors two cyclophilin 40-type enzymes, Cpr6 and Cpr7, which are components of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone machinery. Cpr7 is required for normal growth and is required for maximal activity of heterologous Hsp90-dependent substrates, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the oncogenic tyrosine kinase pp60(v-src). In addition, it has recently been shown that Cpr7 plays a major role in negative regulation of the S. cerevisiae heat shock transcription factor (HSF). To better understand functions associated with Cpr7, a search was undertaken for multicopy suppressors of the cpr7Delta slow-growth phenotype. The screen identified a single gene, designated CNS1 (for cyclophilin seven suppressor), capable of suppressing the cpr7Delta growth defect. Overexpression of CNS1 in cpr7Delta cells also largely restored GR activity and negative regulation of HSF. In vitro protein retention experiments in which Hsp90 heterocomplexes were precipitated resulted in coprecipitation of Cns1. Interaction between Cns1 and the carboxy terminus of Hsp90 was also shown by two-hybrid analysis. The functional consequences of CNS1 overexpression and its physical association with the Hsp90 machinery indicate that Cns1 is a previously unidentified component of molecular chaperone complexes. Thus far, Cns1 is the only tetratricopeptide repeat-containing component of Hsp90 heterocomplexes found to be essential for cell viability under all conditions tested.

dorsovent	DV	The Drosophila CNS develops from three columns of neuroectodermal cells along the dorsoventral (DV) axis: ventral, intermediate, and dorsal. In this and the accompanying paper, we investigate the role of two homeobox genes, vnd and ind, in establishing ventral and intermediate cell fates within the Drosophila CNS. During early neurogenesis, Vnd protein is restricted to ventral column neuroectoderm and neuroblasts; later it is detected in a complex pattern of neurons. We use molecular markers that distinguish ventral, intermediate, and dorsal column neuroectoderm and neuroblasts, and a cell lineage marker for selected neuroblasts, to show that loss of vnd transforms ventral into intermediate column identity and that specific ventral neuroblasts fail to form. Conversely, ectopic vnd produces an intermediate to ventral column transformation. Thus, vnd is necessary and sufficient to induce ventral fates and repress intermediate fates within the Drosophila CNS. Vertebrate homologs of vnd (Nkx2.1 and 2.2) are similarly expressed in the ventral CNS, raising the possibility that DV patterning within the CNS is evolutionarily conserved.
n - methyl - d - aspar	NMDA	Specific patterns of neuronal firing induce changes in synaptic strength that may contribute to learning and memory. If the postsynaptic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are blocked, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission and the learning of spatial information are prevented. The NMDA receptor can bind a protein known as postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), which may regulate the localization of and/or signalling by the receptor. In mutant mice lacking PSD-95, the frequency function of NMDA-dependent LTP and LTD is shifted to produce strikingly enhanced LTP at different frequencies of synaptic stimulation. In keeping with neural-network models that incorporate bidirectional learning rules, this frequency shift is accompanied by severely impaired spatial learning. Synaptic NMDA-receptor currents, subunit expression, localization and synaptic morphology are all unaffected in the mutant mice. PSD-95 thus appears to be important in coupling the NMDA receptor to pathways that control bidirectional synaptic plasticity and learning.

zinc finger transcription	GATA6(-/-)	GATA6 belongs to a family of zinc finger transcription factors that play important roles in transducing nuclear events that regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic morphogenesis in vertebrate species. To examine the function of GATA6 during embryonic development, gene targeting was used to generate GATA6-deficient (GATA6(-/-)) ES cells and mice harboring a null mutation in GATA6. Differentiated embryoid bodies derived from GATA6(-/-) ES cells lack a covering layer of visceral endoderm and severely attenuate, or fail to express, genes encoding early and late endodermal markers, including HNF4, GATA4, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and HNF3beta. Homozygous GATA6(-/-) mice died between embryonic day (E) 6.5 and E7. 5 and exhibited a specific defect in endoderm differentiation including severely down-regulated expression of GATA4 and absence of HNF4 gene expression. Moreover, widespread programmed cell death was observed within the embryonic ectoderm of GATA6-deficient embryos, a finding also observed in HNF4-deficient embryos. Consistent with these data, forced expression of GATA6 activated the HNF4 promoter in nonendodermal cells. Finally, to examine the function of GATA6 during later embryonic development, GATA6(-/-)-C57BL/6 chimeric mice were generated. lacZ-tagged GATA6(-/-) ES cells contributed to all embryonic tissues with the exception of the endodermally derived bronchial epithelium. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which GATA6 lies upstream of HNF4 in a transcriptional cascade that regulates differentiation of the visceral endoderm. In addition, these data demonstrate that GATA6 is required for establishment of the endodermally derived bronchial epithelium.

cell - adhesion protein annexin	AnnX	The pattern of genetic variation across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster is consistent with the occurrence of frequent 'selective sweeps', in which new favourable mutations become incorporated into the species so quickly that linked alleles can 'hitchhike' and also become fixed. Because of the hitchhiking of linked genes, it is generally difficult to identify the target of any putative selective sweep. Here, however, we identify a new gene in D. melanogaster that codes for a sperm-specific axonemal dynein subunit. The gene has a new testes-specific promoter derived from a protein-coding region in a gene encoding the cell-adhesion protein annexin X (AnnX), and it contains a new protein-coding exon derived from an intron in a gene encoding a cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (Cdic). The new transcription unit, designated Sdic (for sperm-specific dynein intermediate chain), has been duplicated about tenfold in a tandem array. Consistent with the selective sweep of this gene, the level of genetic polymorphism near Sdic is unusually low. The discovery of this gene supports other results that point to the rapid molecular evolution of male reproductive functions.

hedge	Hh	In Drosophila, signalling by the protein Hedgehog (Hh) alters the activity of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) by inhibiting the proteolysis of full-length Ci (Ci-155) to its shortened Ci-75 form. Ci-75 is found largely in the nucleus and is thought to be a transcriptional repressor, whereas there is evidence to indicate that Ci-155 may be a transcriptional activator. However, Ci-155 is detected only in the cytoplasm, where it is associated with the protein kinase Fused (Fu), with Suppressor of Fused (Su(fu)), and with the microtubule-binding protein Costal-2. It is not clear how Ci-155 might become a nuclear activator. We show here that mutations in Su(fu) cause an increase in the expression of Hh-target genes in a dose-dependent manner while simultaneously reducing Ci-155 concentration by some mechanism other than proteolysis to Ci-75. Conversely, eliminating Fu kinase activity reduces Hh-target gene expression while increasing Ci-155 concentration. We propose that Fu kinase activity is required for Hh to stimulate the maturation of Ci-155 into a short-lived nuclear transcriptional activator and that Su(fu) opposes this maturation step through a stoichiometric interaction with Ci-155.

hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransfera	Hprt	The mutations responsible for several human neurodegenerative disorders are expansions of translated CAG repeats beyond a normal size range. To address the role of repeat context, we have introduced a 146-unit CAG repeat into the mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (Hprt). Mutant mice express a form of the HPRT protein that contains a long polyglutamine repeat. These mice develop a phenotype similar to the human translated CAG repeat disorders. Repeat containing mice show a late onset neurological phenotype that progresses to premature death. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions are present in affected mice. Our results show that CAG repeats do not need to be located within one of the classic repeat disorder genes to have a neurotoxic effect.
sine ocu	so	Sine oculis (so) and eyes absent (eya) are required for Drosophila eye development and are founding members of the mammalian Six and Eya gene families. These genes have been proposed to act with eyeless (Pax6) to regulate eye development in vertebrates and invertebrates. so encodes a highly diverged homeobox transcription factor and eya encodes a novel nuclear protein. We demonstrate that So and Eya (1) regulate common steps in eye development including cell proliferation, patterning, and neuronal development; (2) synergize in inducing ectopic eyes; and (3) interact in yeast and in vitro through evolutionarily conserved domains. We propose that an So/Eya complex regulates multiple steps in eye development and functions within the context of a network of genes to specify eye tissue identity.

fas	FasL	Fas ligand (FasL) is produced by activated T cells and natural killer cells and it induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells through the death receptor Fas/Apol/CD95. One important role of FasL and Fas is to mediate immune-cytotoxic killing of cells that are potentially harmful to the organism, such as virus-infected or tumour cells. Here we report the discovery of a soluble decoy receptor, termed decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), that binds to FasL and inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis. The DcR3 gene was amplified in about half of 35 primary lung and colon tumours studied, and DcR3 messenger RNA was expressed in malignant tissue. Thus, certain tumours may escape FasL-dependent immune-cytotoxic attack by expressing a decoy receptor that blocks FasL.

lipopolysaccha	LPS	Mutations of the gene Lps selectively impede lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice, rendering them resistant to endotoxin yet highly susceptible to Gram-negative infection. The codominant Lpsd allele of C3H/HeJ mice was shown to correspond to a missense mutation in the third exon of the Toll-like receptor-4 gene (Tlr4), predicted to replace proline with histidine at position 712 of the polypeptide chain. C57BL/10ScCr mice are homozygous for a null mutation of Tlr4. Thus, the mammalian Tlr4 protein has been adapted primarily to subserve the recognition of LPS and presumably transduces the LPS signal across the plasma membrane. Destructive mutations of Tlr4 predispose to the development of Gram-negative sepsis, leaving most aspects of immune function intact.

class ii - associated invariant chain	CLIP	Peptide binding to class II MHC proteins occurs in acidic endosomal compartments following dissociation of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP). Based on peptide binding both to empty class II MHC and to molecules preloaded with peptides including CLIP, we find evidence for two isomeric forms of empty MHC. One (inactive) does not bind peptide. The other (active) binds peptide rapidly, with k(on) 1000-fold faster than previous estimates. The active isomer can be formed either by slow isomerization of the inactive molecule or by dissociation of a preformed peptide/MHC complex. In the absence of peptide, the active isomer is unstable, rapidly converting to the inactive isomer. These results demonstrate that fast peptide binding is an inherent property of one isomer of empty class II MHC. Dissociation of peptides such as CLIP yields this transient, peptide-receptive isomer.
nuclear factor of activated t	NFAT	Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a critical regulator of early gene transcription in response to TCR-mediated signals. Here, we show that mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 develop a profound lymphoproliferative disorder likely due to a lowered threshold for TCR signaling coupled with increased resistance to apoptosis secondary to defective FasL expression. NFAT mutant mice also have allergic blepharitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and a 10(3) to 10(4) fold increase in serum IgG1 and IgE levels, secondary to a dramatic and selective increase in Th2 cytokines. This phenotype may be ascribed to unopposed occupancy of the IL-4 promoter by NFATc. Our data demonstrate that lymphoid homeostasis and Th2 activation require a critical balance among NFAT family members.
serum amyloid	SAA	Serum amyloid A (SAA), a plasma protein inducible in response to many inflammatory conditions, is associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases including reactive amyloidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. We have previously reported an element of the SAA promoter, designated SAA-activating sequence (SAS), that is involved in the inflammation-induced SAA expression, and a nuclear factor, SAS-binding factor (SAF), that interacts with the SAS element has been identified previously (A. Ray and B. K. Ray, Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:1584-1594, 1996). To evaluate how SAF is involved in SAA promoter activation, we have investigated structural features and functional characteristics of this transcription factor. Our studies indicate that SAF belongs to a family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger motifs of the Cys2-His2 type at the carboxyl end. Of the three cloned SAF cDNAs (SAF-1, SAF-5, and SAF-8), SAF-1 isoform showed a high degree of homology to MAZ/ZF87/Pur-1 protein while SAF-5 and SAF-8 isoforms are unique and are related to SAF-1/MAZ/ZF87/Pur-1 at the zinc finger domains but different elsewhere. Although structurally distinct, all members are capable of activating SAS element-mediated expression and display virtually identical sequence specificities. However, varying levels of expression of members of this gene family were observed in different tissues. Functional activity of SAF is regulated by a posttranslational event as SAF DNA-binding and transactivation abilities are increased by a protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and inhibited by a protein kinase inhibitor, H7. Consistent with this observation, increased DNA binding of the cloned SAF and its hyperphosphorylation, in response to okadaic acid treatment of the transfected cells, were observed. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to tissue-specific expression, SAFs, a family of zinc finger transcription factors, undergo a modification by a posttranslational event that confers their SAA promoter-binding activity and transactivation potential.

double - strand	DSBs	To directly determine whether recombinational repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) can occur between heterologous chromosomes and lead to chromosomal rearrangements in mammalian cells, we employed an ES cell system to analyze recombination between repeats on heterologous chromosomes. We found that recombination is induced at least 1000-fold following the introduction of a DSB in one repeat. Most (98%) recombinants repaired the DSB by gene conversion in which a small amount of sequence information was transferred from the unbroken chromosome onto the broken chromosome. The remaining recombinants transferred a larger amount of information, but still no chromosomal aberrations were apparent. Thus, mammalian cells are capable of searching genome-wide for sequences that are suitable for DSB repair. The lack of crossover events that would have led to translocations supports a model in which recombination is coupled to replication.
metabotropic glutamate	mGluRs	We have explored whether the desensitization of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis affects the role that they play in modulating glutamate release. In hippocampal nerve terminals, the agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) facilitated evoked glutamate release, but a second stimulation 5 min later reduced rather than facilitated release. After a 30 min interval between stimulations, DHPG again facilitated glutamate release. In hippocampal slices, DHPG caused an inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from CA1 neurons. However, when the effects of ambient glutamate were prevented, mGluR activation initially induced a facilitation of synaptic transmission, followed by an inhibition. We conclude that group I mGluRs have a dual action on glutamate release, switching from facilitatory to inhibitory upon receptor desensitization triggered by low concentrations of glutamate.

double - stranded	dsRNA	The human double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase PKR inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). Vaccinia virus E3L encodes a dsRNA binding protein that inhibits PKR in virus-infected cells, presumably by sequestering dsRNA activators. Expression of PKR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, dependent on its two dsRNA binding motifs (DRBMs). We found that expression of E3 in yeast overcomes the lethal effect of PKR in a manner requiring key residues (Lys-167 and Arg-168) needed for dsRNA binding by E3 in vitro. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal half of E3, and residue Trp-66 in particular, also is required for anti-PKR function. Because the E3 N-terminal region does not contribute to dsRNA binding in vitro, it appears that sequestering dsRNA is not the sole function of E3 needed for inhibition of PKR. This conclusion was supported by the fact that E3 activity was antagonized, not augmented, by overexpressing the catalytically defective PKR-K296R protein containing functional DRBMs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that a majority of PKR in yeast extracts was in a complex with E3, whose formation was completely dependent on the dsRNA binding activity of E3 and enhanced by the N-terminal half of E3. In yeast two-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding experiments, segments of E3 and PKR containing their respective DRBMs interacted in a manner requiring E3 residues Lys-167 and Arg-168. We also detected interactions between PKR and the N-terminal half of E3 in the yeast two-hybrid and lambda repressor dimerization assays. In the latter case, the N-terminal half of E3 interacted with the kinase domain of PKR, dependent on E3 residue Trp-66. We propose that effective inhibition of PKR in yeast requires formation of an E3-PKR-dsRNA complex, in which the N-terminal half of E3 physically interacts with the protein kinase domain of PKR.

benign familial neonatal convuls	BFNC	Epilepsy affects more than 0.5% of the world's population and has a large genetic component. It is due to an electrical hyperexcitability in the central nervous system. Potassium channels are important regulators of electrical signalling, and benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), an autosomal dominant epilepsy of infancy, is caused by mutations in the KCNQ2 or the KCNQ3 potassium channel genes. Here we show that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are distributed broadly in brain with expression patterns that largely overlap. Expression in Xenopus oocytes indicates the formation of heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 potassium channels with currents that are at least tenfold larger than those of the respective homomeric channels. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents can be increased by intracellular cyclic AMP, an effect that depends on an intact phosphorylation site in the KCNQ2 amino terminus. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations identified in BFNC pedigrees compromised the function of the respective subunits, but exerted no dominant-negative effect on KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromeric channels. We predict that a 25% loss of heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3-channel function is sufficient to cause the electrical hyperexcitability in BFNC. Drugs raising intracellular cAMP may prove beneficial in this form of epilepsy.
schlaf	Slfn	The Schlafen (Slfn) family of genes are differentially regulated during thymocyte maturation and are preferentially expressed in the lymphoid tissues. Ectopic expression of the prototype member Slfn1 early in the T lineage profoundly alters cell growth and development. In these mice, the DP thymocytes fail to complete maturation, and, depending on the transgene dosage, the number of thymocytes is reduced to 1%-30% of normal. Furthermore, expression of the Schlafen family members in fibroblasts and thymoma cells either retards or ablates cell growth. The conceptual protein sequences deduced for each of the family members have no similarity to characterized proteins and must therefore participate in a heretofore unknown regulatory mechanism guiding both cell growth and T cell development.
partial hepatect	PH	The liver regenerates upon partial hepatectomy (PH) as terminally differentiated hepatocytes undergo a tremendous proliferative process. CREM gene expression is powerfully induced during liver regeneration. We show that cell proliferation is significantly reduced upon PH in CREM-/- mice. There is a reduction in DNA synthesis, in the number of mitosis and of phosphorylated histone H3-positive cells. The post-PH proliferation peak is delayed by 10 hr, indicating an altered hepatocyte cell cycle. Expression of cyclins A, B, D1, E, and cdc2, of c-fos and tyrosine aminotransferase is deregulated. CREM mutation results in delayed S-phase entry, impairing the synchronization of proliferation.
neuropeptide	NPY	Feeding is influenced by hypothalamic neuropeptides that promote (orexigenic peptides) or inhibit feeding. Of these, neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexins/hypocretins in the lateral hypothalamus have received attention because their expression is increased during fasting and because they promote feeding when administered centrally. Surprisingly, absence of the orexigenic neuropeptide NPY fails to alter feeding or body weight in normal mice. As deficiency of a single component of the pathway that limits food intake (such as leptin or receptors for melanocortin-4) causes obesity, it has been suggested that orexigenic signals are more redundant than those limiting food intake. To define further the physiological role of MCH and to test the redundancy of orexigenic signals, we generated mice carrying a targeted deletion of the MCH gene. MCH-deficient mice have reduced body weight and leanness due to hypophagia (reduced feeding) and an inappropriately increased metabolic rate, despite their reduced amounts of both leptin and arcuate nucleus pro-opiomelanocortin messenger RNA. Our results show that MCH is a critical regulator of feeding and energy balance which acts downstream of leptin and the melanocortin system, and that deletion of a gene encoding a single orexigenic peptide can result in leanness.

scall	Sd	Scalloped (Sd) and Vestigial (Vg) are each needed for Drosophila wing development. We show that Sd is required for Vg function and that altering their relative cellular levels inhibits wing formation. In vitro, Vg binds directly to both Sd and its human homolog, Transcription Enhancer Factor-1. The interaction domains map to a small region of Vg that is essential for Vg-mediated gene activation and to the carboxy-terminal half of Sd. Our observations indicate that Vg and Sd function coordinately to control the expression of genes required for wing development, which implies that Vg is a tissue-specific transcriptional intermediary factor of Sd.

extrachromosomal rdna	ERCs	Although many cellular and organismal changes have been described in aging individuals, a precise, molecular cause of aging has yet to be found. A prior study of aging yeast mother cells showed a progressive enlargement and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Here we show that these nucleolar changes are likely due to the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) in old cells and that, in fact, ERCs cause aging. Mutants for sgs1, the yeast homolog of the Werner's syndrome gene, accumulate ERCs more rapidly, leading to premature aging and a shorter life span. We speculate on the generality of this molecular cause of aging in higher species, including mammals.
primary ethylene response	PERE	Response to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene in Arabidopsis requires the EIN3/EIL family of nuclear proteins. The biochemical function(s) of EIN3/EIL proteins, however, has remained unknown. In this study, we show that EIN3 and EILs comprise a family of novel sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression by binding directly to a primary ethylene response element (PERE) related to the tomato E4-element. Moreover, we identified an immediate target of EIN3, ETHYLENE-RESPONSE-FACTOR1 (ERF1), which contains this element in its promoter. EIN3 is necessary and sufficient for ERF1 expression, and, like EIN3-overexpression in transgenic plants, constitutive expression of ERF1 results in the activation of a variety of ethylene response genes and phenotypes. Evidence is also provided that ERF1 acts downstream of EIN3 and all other components of the ethylene signaling pathway. The results demonstrate that the nuclear proteins EIN3 and ERF1 act sequentially in a cascade of transcriptional regulation initiated by ethylene gas.

highly conserved	HCRs	The putative function of highly conserved regions (HCRs) within 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) as regulatory RNA sequences was efficiently and quantitatively assessed by using modular retroviral vectors. This strategy led to the identification of HCRs that alter gene expression in response to oxidative or mitogenic stress. Databases were screened for UTR sequences of >100 nucleotides that had retained 70% identity over more than 300 million years of evolution. The effects of 10 such HCRs on a standard reporter mRNA or protein were studied. To this end, we developed a modular retroviral vector that can allow for a direct comparison of the effects of different HCRs on gene expression independent of their gene-intrinsic 5'UTR, promoter, protein coding region, or poly(A) sequence. Five of the HCRs tested decreased mRNA steady-state levels 2- to 10-fold relative to controls, presumably by altering mRNA stability. One HCR increased translation, and one decreased translation. Elevated mitogen levels caused four HCRs to increase protein levels twofold. One HCR increased protein levels fourfold in response to hypoxia. Although nonconserved UTR sequences may also have a role, these results provide evidence that sequences that are highly conserved during evolution are good candidates for RNA motifs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions in gene expression.

transforming growth factor -	TGF-beta	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits cell proliferation, and acquisition of TGF-beta resistance has been linked to tumorigenesis. A genetic screen was performed to identify complementary DNAs that abrogated TGF-beta sensitivity in mink lung epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of murine double minute 2 rescued TGF-beta-induced growth arrest in a p53-independent manner by interference with retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb)/E2F function. In human breast tumor cells, increased MDM2 expression levels correlated with TGF-beta resistance. Thus, MDM2 may confer TGF-beta resistance in a subset of tumors and may promote tumorigenesis by interference with two independent tumor suppressors, p53 and Rb.
thyroid transcription factor	TTF-1	Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) was identified for its critical role in thyroid-specific gene expression; its level in the thyroid is regulated by thyrotropin-increased cyclic AMP levels. TTF-1 was subsequently found in lung tissue, where it regulates surfactant expression, and in certain neural tissues, where its function is unknown. Ligands or signals regulating TTF-1 levels in lung or neural tissue are unknown. We recently identified TTF-1 in rat parafollicular C cells and parathyroid cells. In this report, we show that TTF-1 is present in the parafollicular C cells of multiple species and that it interacts with specific elements on the 5'-flanking regions of the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), calmodulin, and calcitonin genes in C cells. When intracellular Ca2+ levels are increased or decreased in C cells, by the calcium ionophore A23187, by physiologic concentrations of the P2 purinergic receptor ligand ATP, or by changes in extracellular Ca2+ levels, the promoter activity, RNA levels, and binding of TTF-1 to these genes are, respectively, decreased or increased. The changes in TTF-1 inversely alter CaSR gene and calcitonin gene expression. We show, therefore, that TTF-1 is a Ca2+-modulated transcription factor that coordinately regulates the activity of genes critical for Ca2+ homeostasis by parafollicular C cells. We hypothesize that TTF-1 similarly coordinates Ca2+-dependent gene expression in all cells in which TTF-1 and the CaSR are expressed, i. e., parathyroid cells, neural cells in the anterior pituitary or hippocampus, and keratinocytes.

vitelline artery at 9 . 5 days postcoit	d.p.c.	We have investigated the function of TIE2/TEK receptor tyrosine kinase in the development of definitive hematopoiesis. In the vitelline artery at 9.5 days postcoitum (d.p.c.), TIE2+ hematopoietic cells aggregated and adhered to TIE2+ endothelial cells. Soluble TIE2-Fc chimeric protein inhibited the development of hematopoiesis and angiogenesis in the para-aortic splanchnopleural mesoderm (P-Sp) explant culture, and TIE2-deficient mice showed severely impaired definitive hematopoiesis. An in vitro study revealed that Angiopoietin-1 but not Angiopoietin-2 promoted the adhesion to fibronectin (FN) through integrins in TIE2-transfected cells and primary TIE2+ cells sorted from 9.5 d.p.c. P-Sp. Adhesion of TIE2+ cells induced by Angiopoietin-1 enhanced the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

fibroblast growth factor	FGF4	The trophoblast cell lineage is essential for the survival of the mammalian embryo in utero. This lineage is specified before implantation into the uterus and is restricted to form the fetal portion of the placenta. A culture of mouse blastocysts or early postimplantation trophoblasts in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) permitted the isolation of permanent trophoblast stem cell lines. These cell lines differentiated to other trophoblast subtypes in vitro in the absence of FGF4 and exclusively contributed to the trophoblast lineage in vivo in chimeras.
neuropeptide	NPY	Genetic linkage analysis of rats that were selectively bred for alcohol preference identified a chromosomal region that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene. Alcohol-preferring rats have lower levels of NPY in several brain regions compared with alcohol-non-preferring rats. We therefore studied alcohol consumption by mice that completely lack NPY as a result of targeted gene disruption. Here we report that NPY-deficient mice show increased consumption, compared with wild-type mice, of solutions containing 6%, 10% and 20% (v/v) ethanol. NPY-deficient mice are also less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol, as shown by more rapid recovery from ethanol-induced sleep, even though plasma ethanol concentrations do not differ significantly from those of controls. In contrast, transgenic mice that overexpress a marked NPY gene in neurons that usually express it have a lower preference for ethanol and are more sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of this drug than controls. These data are direct evidence that alcohol consumption and resistance are inversely related to NPY levels in the brain.
differentially methylated	DMD	Differentially methylated sequences associated with imprinted genes are proposed to control genomic imprinting. A 2-kb region located 5' to the imprinted mouse H19 gene is hypermethylated on the inactive paternal allele throughout development. To determine whether this differentially methylated domain (DMD) is required for imprinted expression at the endogenous locus, we have generated mice harboring a 1.6-kb targeted deletion of the DMD and assayed for allelic expression of H19 and the linked, oppositely imprinted Igf2 gene. H19 is activated and Igf2 expression is reduced when the DMD deletion is paternally inherited; conversely, upon maternal transmission of the mutation, H19 expression is reduced and Igf2 is activated. Consistent with the DMD's hypothesized role of setting up the methylation imprint, the mutation also perturbs allele-specific methylation of the remaining H19 sequences. In conclusion, these experiments show that the H19 hypermethylated 5' flanking sequences are required to silence paternally derived H19. Additionally, these experiments demonstrate a novel role for the DMD on the maternal chromosome where it is required for the maximal expression of H19 and the silencing of Igf2. Thus, the H19 differentially methylated sequences are required for both H19 and Igf2 imprinting.
functional magnetic resonance	fMRI	We used high-field (3T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to label cortical activity due to visual spatial attention, relative to flattened cortical maps of the retinotopy and visual areas from the same human subjects. In the main task, the visual stimulus remained constant, but covert visual spatial attention was varied in both location and load. In each of the extrastriate retinotopic areas, we found MR increases at the representations of the attended target. Similar but smaller increases were found in V1. Decreased MR levels were found in the same cortical locations when attention was directed at retinotopically different locations. In and surrounding area MT+, MR increases were lateralized but not otherwise retinotopic. At the representation of eccentricities central to that of the attended targets, prominent MR decreases occurred during spatial attention.
3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme	HMG-CoA	The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is best known for catalysing a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, but it also participates in the production of a wide variety of other compounds. Some clinical benefits attributed to inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are now thought to be independent of any serum cholesterol-lowering effect. Here we describe a new cholesterol-independent role for HMG-CoA reductase, in regulating a developmental process: primordial germ cell migration. We show that in Drosophila this enzyme is highly expressed in the somatic gonad and that it is necessary for primordial germ cells to migrate to this tissue. Misexpression of HMG-CoA reductase is sufficient to attract primordial germ cells to tissues other than the gonadal mesoderm. We conclude that the regulated expression of HMG-CoA reductase has a critical developmental function in providing spatial information to guide migrating primordial germ cells.
xenopus or mammalian 3 ' untranslated	3'-UTR	To study the regulation of AUUUA-mediated RNA deadenylation and destabilization during Xenopus early development, we microinjected chimeric mRNAs containing Xenopus or mammalian 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) sequences into Xenopus oocytes, mature eggs, or fertilized embryos. We found that the AU-rich elements (ARE) of Xenopus c-myc II and the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene (GMCSF) both direct deadenylation of chimeric mRNAs in an AUUUA-dependent manner. In the case of the Xenopus c-myc II ARE, mutation of a single AUUUA within an absolutely conserved 11-nucleotide region in c-myc 3'-UTRs prevents ARE-mediated deadenylation. AUUUA-specific deadenylation appears to be developmentally regulated: low deadenylation activity is observed in the oocyte, whereas rapid deadenylation occurs following egg activation or fertilization. Deadenylation results in the accumulation of stable deadenylated RNAs that become degraded only following mid-blastula transition. We conclude that ARE-mediated mRNA deadenylation can be uncoupled from ARE-mediated mRNA decay and that AUUUAs directly signal deadenylation during Xenopus early development.

intermediate neuroblasts	ind	One of the first steps in neurogenesis is the diversification of cells along the dorsoventral axis. In Drosophila the central nervous system develops from three longitudinal columns of cells: ventral cells that express the vnd/nk2 homeobox gene, intermediate cells, and dorsal cells that express the msh homeobox gene. Here we describe a new Drosophila homeobox gene, intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), which is expressed specifically in the intermediate column cells. ind is essential for intermediate column development: Null mutants have a transformation of intermediate to dorsal column neuroectoderm fate, and only 10% of the intermediate column neuroblasts develop. The establishment of dorsoventral column identity involves negative regulation: Vnd represses ind in the ventral column, whereas ind represses msh in the intermediate column. Vertebrate genes closely related to vnd (Nkx2.1 and Nkx2.2), ind (Gsh1 and Gsh2), and msh (Msx1 and Msx3) are expressed in corresponding ventral, intermediate, and dorsal domains during vertebrate neurogenesis, raising the possibility that dorsoventral patterning within the central nervous system is evolutionarily conserved.
gamma - aminobutyric	GABA	GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, where it exerts its effects through ionotropic (GABA(A/C)) receptors to produce fast synaptic inhibition and metabotropic (GABA(B)) receptors to produce slow, prolonged inhibitory signals. The gene encoding a GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R1) has been cloned; however, when expressed in mammalian cells this receptor is retained as an immature glycoprotein on intracellular membranes and exhibits low affinity for agonists compared with the endogenous receptor on brain membranes. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a new subtype of the GABAB receptor (GABA(B)R2), which we identified by mining expressed-sequence-tag databases. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that this new GABA(B)R2-receptor subtype forms heterodimers with GABA(B)R1 through an interaction at their intracellular carboxy-terminal tails. Upon expression with GABA(B)R2 in HEK293T cells, GABA(B)R1 is terminally glycosylated and expressed at the cell surface. Co-expression of the two receptors produces a fully functional GABA(B) receptor at the cell surface; this receptor binds GABA with a high affinity equivalent to that of the endogenous brain receptor. These results indicate that, in vivo, functional brain GABA(B) receptors may be heterodimers composed of GABA(B)R1 and GABA(B)R2.
dendritic	DC	The transcription factor RelB had been shown to be important for dendritic cell (DC) development, but the type of DC involved was not clear. Here, we report that RelB mRNA is expressed strongly in CD8alpha- DEC-205- DC but only weakly in CD8alpha+ DEC-205+ DC. In addition, CD8alpha+ DEC-205+ DC are present and functional in RelB null mice, the DC deficiency being mainly in the CD8alpha- DEC-205- population. By constructing bone-marrow chimeric mice, we demonstrate that the partial deficiency in RelB null thymic DC is a secondary effect of disrupted thymic architecture. However, the deficiency in splenic CD8alpha- DEC-205- DC is a direct, stem cell intrinsic effect of the RelB mutation. Thus, RelB selectively regulates a myeloid-related DC lineage.
