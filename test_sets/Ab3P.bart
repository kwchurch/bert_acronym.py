timed artificial insemination	TAI	Comparison of two timed artificial insemination (TAI) protocols for management of first insemination postpartum.
general anesthesia	GA	PURPOSE: One hundred percent O(2) is used routinely for preoxygenation and induction of anesthesia. The higher the O(2) concentration the faster is the development of atelectasis, an important cause of impaired pulmonary gas exchange during general anesthesia (GA). We evaluated the effect of ventilation with 0.4 FiO(2) in air, 0.4 FiO(2) in N(2)O and 100% O(2) following intubation on the development of impaired gas exchange. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients aged 18-40 yr, undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were administered 100% O(2) for preoxygenation (three minutes) and ventilation by mask (two minutes). Following intubation these patients were randomly divided into three groups of nine each and ventilated either with 0.4 FiO(2) in air, 0.4 FiO(2) in N(2)O or 100% O(2). Arterial blood gases were obtained before preoxygenation and 30 min following intubation for PaO(2) analysis. Subsequently PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios were calculated. Results were analyzed with Student's t test and one-way ANOVA. P value of < or = 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Ventilation of the lungs with O(2) in air (FiO(2) 0.4) significantly improved the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio from baseline, while 0.4 FiO(2) in N(2)O or 100% O(2) worsened the ratio (558 +/- 47 vs 472 +/- 28, 365 +/- 34 vs 472 +/- 22 and 351 +/- 23 vs 477 +/- 28 respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ventilation of lungs with O(2) in air (FiO(2) 0.4) improves gas exchange in young healthy patients during GA.
multiple sclerosis	MS	Texture analysis was applied to MR images of the spinal cord in an attempt to quantify pathological changes that occur in multiple sclerosis (MS). Texture features quantify macroscopic lesions and also the microscopic abnormalities that may be undetectable using conventional measures of lesion volume and number. Significant differences in texture between normal controls and MS patients were seen. Texture differences were detected between normal controls and relapsing-remitting patients before detectable spinal cord atrophy. There was also significant correlation between texture and disability. The segmentation and texture analysis technique demonstrates intraobserver coefficients of variation ranging from 0. 6-8.2%. Texture analysis has potential as a tool for monitoring changes associated with the development of disability in patients with MS. Reproducibility and sensitivity must be improved to use the technique for serial monitoring in individuals. Magn Reson Med 42:929-935, 1999.
5-hydroxytryptamine	5HT	The active transport of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) by blood platelets of unipolar and bipolar depressed patients was determined. The 5HT uptake by platelets of bipolar patients was determined in depressive, euthymic and manic states. The 5HT uptake was always followed by studying platelets of healthy individuals of the same sex and age. The results confirm the known fact that there is a decreased 5HT active transport in platelets of unipolar depressed patients. On the other hand, the amount of 5HT transported by platelets of bipolar depressed patients was higher than that observed in platelets of healthy individuals. In manic and euthymic bipolar patients the uptake was similar to their matched controls.
impedance cardiogram	ICG	Measurements of systolic ejection dynamics by impedance cardiography were compared with simultaneous Doppler echocardiography in normal subjects and coronary artery disease patients. Patients with chest pain admitted for elective coronary angiography were monitored by simultaneous impedance cardiography and Doppler echocardiography before, during, and after treadmill exercise. Ensemble-averaged ECG, impedance cardiogram (ICG), the first derivative of ICG (dZ/dt), and Doppler waveforms were analyzed to identify systolic ejection variables. The timing of aortic valve opening was well correlated (r = 0.78) the timing of peak ejection velocity was very well correlated (r = 0.86), and the timing of aortic valve closure was moderately correlated (r = 0.69 and r = 0.73) in these subjects. The thoracic electrical impedance acceleration and normalized impedance acceleration indices were moderately correlated with Doppler model acceleration (r = 0.74, r = 0.79). The impedance cardiogram waveforms are of complex origin and are related to both aortic blood velocity and aortic blood acceleration. Users of dZ/dt timing features for determining aortic valvular events might consider alternative impedance features to improve ejection time accuracy.
oestrogen containing contraceptive pill	OCP	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women with congenital heart disease were receiving appropriate advice on contraception. SETTING: Adult congenital heart disease clinic in a tertiary cardiac referral centre. DESIGN: Questionnaire administered to 35 consecutive female patients attending the adult congenital clinic. The cardiologist assessed what the risk would be if each patient used an oestrogen containing contraceptive pill (OCP). RESULTS: Of the 33 patients admitted to the study 6 patients thought their heart condition precluded them from taking an OCP when in fact it did not and 3 incorrectly said that an OCP would be suitable for them. Three women with relatively minor lesions had been incorrectly denied the OCP and 2 further patients were using inappropriate methods. There had been 6 unwanted pregnancies in the total group. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with congenital heart disease do not know the most appropriate method of contraception for them or have received incorrect advice. It is often patients with less severe lesions who receive the most inappropriate advice. It is clear that the family planning needs of this population are currently poorly catered for. Each unit must ensure that the information necessary in making informed decisions on contraception is available to the doctor advising on family planning.
ethylene glycol	EG	A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay is described for identification and quantification of the antifreezes ethylene glycol (EG) and diethylene glycol (DEG) in plasma for early diagnosis of a glycol intoxication. After addition of 1,3-propanediol as internal standard, the plasma sample was deproteinized by acetone and an aliquot of the supernatant was evaporated followed by microwave-assisted pivalylation. After gas chromatographic separation, the glycols were first identified by comparison of the full mass spectra with reference spectra and then quantified. The quantification has been validated according to the criteria established by the Journal of Chromatography B. The assay was found to be selective. The calibration curves for EG and DEG were linear from 0.1 g/l to 1.0 g/l. The limit of detection for EG and DEG was 0.01 g/l and the limit of quantification for both was 0.1 g/l. The absolute recoveries were 50 and 65% for the low quality control samples and 51 and 73% for the high quality control samples of EG and DEG, respectively. Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were inside the required limits. The glycols in frozen plasma samples were stable for more than 6 months. The method was successfully applied to several authentic plasma samples from patients intoxicated with glycols. It has also been suitable for analysis of EG and DEG in urine.

TNF soluble receptors	TNF-sR	ANCA are found in various systemic vasculitis and are supposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, in co-operation with other factors such as cytokines. A total of 36 ANCA-positive and 10 ANCA-negative serum samples were analysed for the presence of TNF soluble receptors (TNF-sR), which are shed from the surface of activated cells and may act as TNF inhibitors. Of the ANCA-positive samples, 67% had elevated TNF-sR75 and 72% had elevated TNF-sR55 compared to ANCA-negative specimens (mean [S.E.] 18.7 [17.3] vs 3.6 [1.5] and 10.5 [9.7] vs 1.9 [0.7] ng/ml, P < 0.01). Elevation of TNF-sR in patients with ANCA suggests that cytokines and their inhibitors are involved in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated autoimmune diseases.
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry	GC-MS	This review article underlines the importance of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for determination of steroids in man. The use of steroids labelled with stable isotopes as internal standard and subsequent analysis by GC-MS yields up to now the only reliable measurement of steroids in serum. Isotope dilution GC-MS is the reference method for evaluation of routine analysis of serum steroid hormones. GC-MS is an important tool for detection of steroid hormone doping and combined with a combustion furnace and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer the misuse of testosterone by athletes can be discovered. Finally the so called urinary steroid profile by GC and GC-MS is the method of choice for detection of steroid metabolites in health and disease.
inversion recovery fast spin-echo	FSE	Comparison of inversion recovery fast spin-echo (FSE) with T2-weighted fat-saturated FSE and T1-weighted MR imaging in bone marrow lesion detection.
inversion recovery	IR	OBJECTIVE. To prospectively compare inversion recovery (IR) fast spin-echo (FSE) with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) and T2-weighted chemical-shift fat-saturated (FS) FSE magnetic resonance sequences in the detection of bone marrow abnormality. DESIGN. Twenty-nine sets of T1-weighted SE [400-640/10-20 (TR/TE)], T2-weighted FS-FSE [2400-3800/91-112/8 (TR/TE/ETL), and IR-FSE [3700-6000/12-14/170/8 (TR/TE/T1/ETL)] images were acquired with a 1.5-T magnet in 27 patients with bone marrow lesions. The visibility, margination, and extent of 41 lesions, image quality, contrast, and artifacts were qualitatively and quantitatively compared. RESULTS. The lesions were more conspicuous on the IR-FSE than on the T1-weighted SE and T2-weighed FS-FSE images. The extent of lesions was similar for all three sequences. Image quality was better and there were fewer motion artifacts on the T1-weighted images. The mean lesion contrasted-to-noise ratio was significantly higher on the T1-weighted images (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. The IR-FSE sequence is highly sensitive for detecting bone marrow pathology, with scan time comparable to the T1-weighted SE and T2-weighted FS-FSE sequences.

amino acid	aa	The protein product (c-Myc) of the human c-myc proto-oncogene carries a beta-turn/alpha-helix motif at the exon2/exon3 boundary. The amino acid (aa) sequence and secondary structure of this motif are highly conserved among several nuclearly localized oncogene products, c-Myc, N-Myc, c-Fos, SV40 large T and adenovirus (Ad) Ela. Removal of this region from Ad E1a results in the loss of the transforming properties of the virus without destroying its known transregulatory functions. In order to analyse whether deletion of the above-mentioned region from c-Myc has a similar effect on its transformation activity, we constructed a deletion mutant (c-myc delta) lacking the respective aa at the exon2/exon3 boundary. In contrast to the c-myc wild-type gene product, constitutive expression of c-myc delta does not lead to the immortalization of primary mouse embryo fibroblast cells (MEF cells). This result indicates that c-Myc and Ad El a share a common domain which is involved in the transformation process by both oncogenes.

Kappa opioid receptors	KORs	Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) were immunocytochemically localized in the lumbosacral spinal cord of female rats in different stages of the estrous cycle to examine the influence of hormonal status on receptor density. KOR labeling was primarily in fine processes and a few neuronal cell bodies in the superficial dorsal horn and the dorsolateral funiculus. Quantitative light microscopic densitometry of the superficial dorsal horn revealed that rats in diestrus had significantly lower KOR densities than those in proestrus or estrus. This suggests that female reproductive hormones regulate spinal KOR levels, which may contribute to variations in analgesic effectiveness of KOR agonists across the estrous cycle.
mantle cell lymphoma	MCL	We describe a previously unreported case of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) associated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a 63-year-old woman with a 1-year history of weakness of arm and leg muscles. The both molecular-genetic and flow cytometry analysis of lymphocytes of peripheral blood (PB) demonstrated leukemic phase of MCL.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis	LCM	Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) was interfering particles were enriched relative to infectious virions by ultracentrifugation in a shallow gradient made of Urografin. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that they lacked the small ('S') 23S RNA as well as GP-1 and GP-2 of the infectious virion and also lacked a newly characterized glycoprotein of apparent mol. wt. 85 x 10(3); instead, they contained a novel glycoprotein with mol. wt. 65 x 10(3).
capillary zone electrophoresis	CZE	A capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method was developed for the quantitative analysis of fosinopril sodium. Validation parameters of the CZE method were evaluated and compared to an existing LC method. In terms of precision and sensitivity. LC performance was superior to that of the CZE method for this application. The CZE method achieved better selectivity for several degradants of interest within a much shorter analysis time than did the LC method. Effects of detection wavelength, applied voltage and buffer concentration on optimization of the CZE method are presented. Effects of diluent composition on capillary loading and peak behaviour are also discussed.
infectious bronchitis virus	IBV	Two methods for collecting specimens for measuring sequential antibody activity of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were compared. Whole blood was collected on filter-paper strips, dried for 2 hr at 37 C, and then stored in plastic bags at 4 C or eluted overnight and tested immediately. Eluates of whole blood were paired with serum samples and tested for IBV antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at four weekly intervals. Both sampling methods yielded ELISA antibody levels that were detectable at 7 days postinfection (PI), peaked at 21 days PI, and then began to decline by 28 days PI. The paired samples showed no significant difference (P less than 0.05) between ELISA titers at any time tested. Whole blood dried on filter paper could be stored sealed in plastic bags at 4 C for at least 2 weeks with no appreciable loss of antibody titers. Virus-neutralizing antibodies, measured in serum only, were not detectable until 14 days PI but then continued to rise through 28 days PI. It was concluded that eluates of whole blood dried on filter paper may be used as an alternative to sera in ELISA for measuring IBV antibodies.

deoxyspergualin	DSP	To gain further insights into the immunopharmacological mode of action of the immunosuppressant antibiotic deoxyspergualin (DSP), its effects were evaluated in murine lethal endo- and exotoxemia. These are two cytokine-mediated macrophage and T cell dependent immunoinflammatory conditions that can be induced in D-Galactosamine (D-Gal) presensitized mice by the injections with either LPS or SEB, respectively. The results show that prophylactic treatment with DSP (2.5 or 5 mg/kg bd.wt. 48, 24 and 2 h prior to challenge) neither improved the rate of survival, nor influenced the massive increase in the blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha which followed the challenge with LPS or SEB. In sharp contrast, these clinical and seroimmunological events were both markedly counteracted by prophylactic treatment with sodium fusidate, another immunosuppressive agent used as control.

neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity	NK1R-ir	All medullary central chemoreceptor sites contain neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity (NK1R-ir). We ask if NK1R-ir neurons and processes are involved in chemoreception. At one site, the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parapyramidal region (RTN/Ppy), we injected a substance P-saporin conjugate (SP-SAP; 0.1 pmol in 100 nl) to kill NK1R-ir neurons specifically, or SAP alone as a control. We made measurements for 15 days after the injections in two groups of rats. In group 1, with unilateral injections made in the awake state via a pre-implanted guide cannula, we compared responses within rats using initial baseline data. In group 2, with bilateral injections made under anaesthesia at surgery, we compared responses between SP-SAP- and SAP-treated rats. SP-SAP treatment reduced the volume of the RTN/Ppy region that contained NK1R-ir neuronal somata and processes by 44 % (group 1) and by 47 and 40 % on each side, respectively (group 2). Ventilation (.V(E)) and tidal volume (V(T)) were decreased during air breathing in sleep and wakefulness (group 2; P < 0.001; two-way ANOVA) and P(a,CO2) was increased (group 2; P < 0.05; Student's t test). When rats breathed an air mixture containing 7 % CO(2) during sleep and wakefulness, .V(E) and V(T) were lower (groups 1 and 2; P < 0.001; ANOVA) and the Delta.V(E) in air containing 7 % CO(2) compared to air was decreased by 28-30 % (group 1) and 17-22 % (group 2). SP-SAP-treated rats also slept less during air breathing. We conclude that neurons with NK1R-ir somata or processes in the RTN/Ppy region are either chemosensitive or they modulate chemosensitivity. They also provide a tonic drive to breathe and may affect arousal.

SP-SAP-treated rats also slept less during air breathing. We conclude that neurons with NK1R-ir somata or processes in the RTN/Ppy region are either chemosensitive or they modulate chemosensitivity. They also provide a tonic drive to breathe and may affect arousal.
difference limen	DL	This study examined and compared bilabial compression force difference limen (DL) values (the minimally perceivable difference between two compression forces) for a group of twenty normal-speaking female subjects (mean age, 25 years) under conditions with and without the teeth clenched. In addition, measures of maximum bilabial compression force under conditions with and without the teeth clenched were obtained. Mean DL values obtained against a standard of 100 gm were 36 gm for the clenched condition and 38 gm with no clenching. Discrimination performance under these two conditions was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05). Mean maximum bilabial compression force was 411 gm with the teeth clenched and 568 gm without clenching. This difference in performance was significant (P less than 0.01). This study provides initial normal data against which individuals with labial sensorimotor dysfunction can be compared.
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	HNSCC	Very little is known about possible intra-tumoural genetic heterogeneity between primary tumours and lymph node metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To investigate this phenomenon, we analysed 96 micro-dissected tumour samples for allelic imbalance at four of the most frequently altered chromosomal locations in HNSCC (3p14.2; 9p21; 11q23.3; 17p13.1) using microsatellite markers. From 23 patients, matched pairs of primary tumour and lymph node metastasis were analysed. Discordance in the allelic distribution was identified in 8 cases (35%). With one exception, the metastasis contained a more balanced allelic status than the primary tumour. In contrast, in a group of 25 tumours with two anatomically different samples from the primary tumour site, discordance was identified in only 3 tumours (13%). These results are compatible with the dissemination of subclones from the primary tumour site with a more balanced allelotype in the metastasis. In our opinion, several scenarios could explain this phenomenon. From a clinical point of view, genetic discordance between the metastasis and the primary tumour must be taken into consideration when establishing molecular biologic markers for choice of therapy and prognosis in head and neck cancer.
non-rapid-eye-movement	NREM	Studies of sleep influences on human pharyngeal and other respiratory muscles suggest that the activity of these muscles may be affected by non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep in a nonuniform manner. This variable sleep response may relate to the pattern of activation of the muscle (inspiratory phasic vs. tonic) and peripheral events occurring in the airway. Furthermore, the ability of these muscles to respond to respiratory stimuli during NREM sleep may also differ. To systematically investigate the effect of NREM sleep on respiratory muscle activity, we studied two tonic muscles [tensor palatini (TP), masseter (M)] and two inspiratory phasic ones [genioglossus (GG), diaphragm (D)], also measuring the response of these muscles to inspiratory resistive loading (12 cmH2O.l-1.s) during wakefulness and NREM sleep. Seven normal male subjects were studied on a single night with intramuscular electrodes placed in the TP and GG and surface electrodes placed over the D and M. Sleep stage, inspiratory airflow, and moving time average electromyograph (EMG) of the above four muscles were continuously recorded. The EMG of both tonic muscles fell significantly (P less than 0.05) during NREM sleep [TP awake, 4.3 +/- 0.05 (SE) arbitrary units, stage 2, 1.1 +/- 0.2; stage 3/4, 1.0 +/- 0.2. Masseter awake, 4.8 +/- 0.6; stage 2, 3.3 +/- 0.5; stage 3/4, 3.1 +/- 0.5]. On the other hand, the peak phasic EMG of both inspiratory phasic muscles (GG and D) was well maintained.

maximum expiratory flow-volume	MEFV	Acute exposures to hemp dust, in healthy subjects as well as hemp workers with byssinosis, resulted in two different responses. Men with symptoms (chest tightness, coughing, and wheezing) after exposure showed decreases of forced expiratory volumes (FEV(1.0)), flow rates on maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves, and of vital capacity (VC), while airway conductance (Gaw: TGV ratio) did not decrease significantly ("flow rate response"). Men without symptoms after exposure showed no changes of VC, FEV(1.0), and MEFV curves, but had a significantly decreased airway conductance ("conductance response"). The flow rate response is attributed to a pharmacological bronchoconstrictor effect of hemp dust on small airways, the conductance response to a mechanical or reflex effect of hemp dust on large airways. Both responses were abolished by a bronchodilator drug. The type of response reflects a difference between individuals and is not related to age, smoking habits, or prior exposure history. Men with normal control function data had either a flow rate or a conductance response. All men with abnormal control data had a flow rate response.Long-term hemp dust exposure causes irreversible obstructive lung disease, in particular among men who respond to acute dust exposure with symptoms and flow rate decreases. The detection of this response, with FEV(1.0) measurements and MEFV curves, is essential in the study of byssinosis. Decreases of airway conductance after dust exposure have no consistent relation to the development of clinical symptoms. The relative value of measurements of maximum expiratory flow rates and of airway conductance in other lung diseases needs to be reassessed.

human epidermal growth factor	hEGF	[Development of a new therapeutic method in hepatocellular carcinoma using a culture system--the intensifying effect of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) on the antitumor action of antitumor agents]
hepatocellular carcinoma	HCC	The culture system of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been established and the effect of hepatotrophic factors on these cell lines have been studied. During this study the effect of the human epidermal growth factor intensifying anti-tumor action of anti-tumor agents will be evaluated. HCC cell lines (C-HC-4, C-HC-20) show logarithmic growth in the serum-free medium. These growth curves after administration of 1 x 10(-12- -8) M of hEGF were measured, and the existence of the hEGF receptors was evaluated using the ABC method. The growth curve of HC-4 transplanted into nude mice was measured in 4 groups; the control group, the hEGF group, the gamma Interferon (gamma IFN) group, and the hEGF + gamma IFN group. The hEGF enhanced the cell growth of C-HC-4 and C-HC-20, and EGF receptors were confirmed immunohistologically. In the hEGF+ gamma IFN group, growth inhibition seems to be most important. The hEGF may intensify the anti-tumor action of the anti-tumor agents.

Peripheral myelin protein 22	PMP22	Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a tetraspan glycoprotein whose misexpression is associated with a family of hereditary peripheral neuropathies. In a recent report, we have characterized a novel PMP22-deficient mouse model in which the first two coding exons were replaced by the lacZ reporter. To investigate further the myelin abnormalities in the absence of PMP22, sciatic nerves and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron explant cultures from PMP22-deficient mice were studied at various stages of myelination. Throughout the first 3 months of postnatal development, myelin protein and beta4 integrin levels are dramatically reduced, whereas p75 and beta1 integrin remain elevated. By immunostaining, the distributions of several glial proteins, including beta4 integrin, the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, and E-cadherin, are altered. Schwann cells from PMP22-deficient mice are able to produce limited amounts of myelin in DRG explant cultures, yet the internodal segments are dramatically fewer and shorter. The comparison of PMP22-deficient mice with other PMP22 mutant models reveals that the decrease in beta4 integrin is specific to an absence of PMP22. Furthermore, whereas lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 and ubiquitin are notably up-regulated in nerves of PMP22-deficient mice, heat shock protein 70 levels remain constant or decrease compared with wild-type or PMP22 mutant samples. Together these results support a role for PMP22 in the early events of peripheral nerve myelination. Additionally, although myelin abnormalities are a commonality among PMP22 neuropathic models, the underlying subcellular mechanisms are distinct and depend on the specific genetic abnormality.

prostaglandins	PG	This study examined 1) effects of prostaglandins (PG) on renin secretion and renin gene expression from isolated juxtaglomerular granular cells and 2) expression of cyclooxygenases in juxtaglomerular structures. Incubation of granular cell cultures with PGE2, -I2, -F2 alpha, and thromboxane B2 identified PGI2 and PGE2 as stimulators of renin secretion; the effects were dose and time dependent. PGE2 also increased renin mRNA accumulation time and dose dependent. PGE2 and PGI2 activated adenylate cyclase concentration dependent in granular cells. PGE2 stimulations of renin secretion and renin mRNA were nonadditive to those of forskolin and were inhibited by endothelin. The findings are compatible with cellular actions through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). On total RNA harvested from whole kidneys, from microdisected glomeruli with attached afferent arterioles and from mesangial cells in primary culture, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed significant expression of cyclooxygenase I and II. By direct interaction with PG receptors on renal juxtaglomerular cells, PGE2 and PGI2 can act as potent and rapid stimulators of renin secretion and renin mRNA probably through cAMP-dependent pathways.
Drosophila Hedgehog	Hh	The secreted Drosophila Hedgehog (Hh) protein induces transcription of specific genes by an unknown mechanism that requires the serpentine transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Protein kinase A (PKA) has been implicated in the mechanism of Hh signal transduction because it acts to repress Hh target genes in imaginal disc cells that express Ci. Changes in Ci protein levels, detected by an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the carboxy-terminal half of Ci, have been suggested to mediate the positive effects of Hh and the negative effects of PKA on Hh target gene expression in imaginal discs. Here we show that PKA inhibition, like Hh, leads to increased "carboxy-terminal" Ci staining and Hh target gene expression in embryos. In addition, we find that Hh and Smo can stimulate target gene expression at constant Ci levels and that increased PKA activity can induce ectopic Hh target gene expression in a manner that requires Smo and Ci activities but does not involve changes in Ci protein concentration. This suggests a branching pathway of Hh signal transduction downstream of Smo and that PKA exerts opposite effects on the two branches. Finally we show that Hh signaling in embryos does not depend on cAMP-dependent regulation of PKA activity.

non-small cell lung cancer	NSCLC	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutation of SOX4 gene in the different tumor tissues with pathological stages and types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to explore its roles in the progression of lung carcinoma. METHODS: The SOX4 gene HMG-box of lung cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues were amplified by PCR, 20 cases shown difference by single strand conformation polymorphyism analysis were sequenced. The DNA sequences were compared with normal sequences by software Clustal and DNAStar. RESULTS: In the 90 NSCLCs, 18 cases were found with mutations of SOX4 gene and were sequenced, and there were 2 mutational points. Seven were detected from squamous cell carcinoma, five from adenocarcinoma and six from adeno-squamous. Three were obtained from tissues in stage I, five in stage II, six in stage III, and four in stage IV. The mutation rate in stage II, III and IV was significantly higher than that in stage I. CONCLUSION: SOX4 gene mutation is not associated with pathology histological types of tumor, but it is significantly associated with pathological stages and the mutation rate increases gradually, which has relation with advanced pathological stages in NSCLC. The results indicate that the SOX4 gene mutations might be related in the lung carcinogenesis and tumor metastasis. The study also provides molecular data for study the links between the mutation of SOX gene and human oncogenesis.
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase	PEPCase	In C4 plants, the photosynthetic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase; EC 4.1.1.31) is subjected to a phosphorylation process via the light-dependent up-regulation of a Ca2+-independent PEPCase-kinase. The present work aimed to study the effect of salt stress on PEPCase phosphorylation in Sorghum vulgare Pers. leaves. The growth of salt-treated plants was reduced compared with that of the control plants. PEPCase activity modestly increased (around 20-40%) whereas PEPCase phosphorylation was markedly enhanced, on a protein basis, in extracts from illuminated leaves. The enhanced protein kinase activity was found to display a low molecular mass in the range 32-35 kDa, to be independent of Ca2+ and to be up-regulated by light. Furthermore, up-regulation was blocked in vivo by the cytosolic protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Collectively, these data demonstrated that salinity stress altered the Ca2+-independent PEPCase-kinase, presumably by increasing the mesophyll content of the enzyme. Potassium chloride, but not abscisic acid, mimicked the effect of NaCl on PEPCase-kinase activity.
N-methyl-D-aspartate	NMDA	Hypothalamic site of action for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) on LH secretion.
luteinizing hormone	LH	Excitatory amino acids have been shown to increase luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion following ventricular or systemic administration. In the present study we attempted to determine possible hypothalamic sites of action for the potent excitatory amino acid agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The ability of NMDA to enhance LH release was tested in male rats following infusion into the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHY), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC). In the MPO, infusion of 50 or 500 pmole NMDA increased pituitary LH secretion, resulting in a 2-7 fold increase in plasma LH. The 50 pmole dose was selected to test more caudal hypothalamic sites. Plasma LH levels were not affected following microinfusion of NMDA (50 pmole) into the AHY, VMH, and ARC. The present results indicate a regional specificity for NMDA in the enhancement of LH secretion. This regional specificity may reflect either a greater density of LHRH perikarya in the MPO or the presence of specific amino acid receptors on neuronal elements in the MPO, but not on neuronal elements in the other areas tested.

This regional specificity may reflect either a greater density of LHRH perikarya in the MPO or the presence of specific amino acid receptors on neuronal elements in the MPO, but not on neuronal elements in the other areas tested.
anterior hypothalamic nucleus	AHY	Excitatory amino acids have been shown to increase luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion following ventricular or systemic administration. In the present study we attempted to determine possible hypothalamic sites of action for the potent excitatory amino acid agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The ability of NMDA to enhance LH release was tested in male rats following infusion into the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHY), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC). In the MPO, infusion of 50 or 500 pmole NMDA increased pituitary LH secretion, resulting in a 2-7 fold increase in plasma LH. The 50 pmole dose was selected to test more caudal hypothalamic sites.

phosphorus	P	Two common manure storage practices are stockpiles and lagoons. The manure from stockpiles is applied to soils in solid form, while lagoon manure is applied as a liquid. Soil amendment with manure in any form introduces a significant amount of phosphorus (P) that exists in both organic and inorganic forms. However, little is known about P speciation in manure stored under different conditions, or the subsequent forms when applied to soils. We used solution (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and conventional P fractionation and speciation methods to investigate P forms in dairy manure and liquid lagoon manure, and to study how long-term amendment with these manures influenced surface and subsurface soil P speciation. Our results show that the P forms in solid and lagoon manure are similar. About 30% of the total P was organic, mostly as orthophosphate monoesters. On a dry weight basis, total P was much higher in the solid manure. In the manure-amended soils the total P concentrations of the surface soils were similar, regardless of manure type. Total P in the subsurface soil was greater in the lagoon-manure-amended soil than the solid-manure-amended subsurface soil. However, the fraction of organic P was greater in the subsurface of the solid-manure-amended soil. The NMR results indicate that the majority of organic P in the soils is phytic acid, which is enriched in the surface soils compared with the subsurface soils. These results provide insight into P speciation and dynamics in manure-amended soils that will further increase our understanding on how best to manage manure disposal on soils.

ornithine decarboxylase	ODC	High doses of folate and its quinazoline analogue with antitumour activity, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717), caused severe renal damage in mice, leading in the case of folate to death. The mouse kidneys increased in weight, which was accompanied by time- and dose-dependent induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. In contrast, methotrexate (MTX) had negligible effect on mouse kidneys except when applied together with the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, indomethacin.

Neurocysticercosis	NCC	Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is caused when the cysticercus larvae of Taenia solium infect the central nervous system. The larvae usually land in the parenchymal tissue, but quite rarely can lodge in the ventricles and cisterns of the brain. Unlike parenchymal NCC, it is not easy to demonstrate the cysticercus cysts within the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Computed tomography and even conventional MR sequences can fail to detect such cysts. However, obtaining three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo imaging sequences can help in improving the detection of intraventricular NCC, as is borne out by a case described in the present report. The use of such special MR sequences is therefore strongly advocated in suspected cases of intraventricular NCC.
Coregulator small nuclear RING finger protein	SNURF	Coregulator small nuclear RING finger protein (SNURF) enhances Sp1- and steroid receptor-mediated transcription by different mechanisms.
androgen receptor	AR	The small nuclear RING finger protein SNURF is not only a coactivator in steroid receptor-dependent transcription but also activates transcription from steroid-independent promoters. In this work, we show that SNURF, via the RING finger domain, enhances protein binding to Sp1 elements/GC boxes and interacts and cooperates with Sp1 in transcriptional activation. The activation of androgen receptor (AR) function requires regions other than the RING finger of SNURF, and SNURF does not influence binding of AR to cognate DNA elements. The zinc finger region (ZFR) together with the hinge region of AR are sufficient for contacting SNURF. The nuclear localization signal in the boundary between ZFR and the hinge region participates in the association of AR with SNURF, and a receptor mutant lacking the C-terminal part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal shows attenuated response to coexpressed SNURF. Some AR ZFR point mutations observed in patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome or male breast cancer impair the interaction of AR with SNURF and also render AR refractory to the transcription-activating effect of SNURF. Collectively, SNURF modulates the transcriptional activities of androgen receptor and Sp1 via different domains, and it may act as a functional link between steroid- and Sp1-regulated transcription.

tumor necrosis factor	TNF	The role of genetic factors in the individual predisposition to develop ischemic stroke has been assessed by previous studies performed both in animal models and in humans. The main goal of the current investigation was to determine the possible contribution of genes encoding procoagulant and inflammatory factors on the occurrence of ischemic stroke in a cohort of young cases and corresponding controls. One hundred and fifteen cases of ischemic stroke were recruited for this study. A detailed clinical assessment, a definite etiologic diagnosis, as well as the presence/absence of known risk factors for ischemic stroke were obtained for each patient. As a control group 180 healthy, unrelated subjects were included. The whole population was screened for polymorphisms belonging to genes encoding FII, FV, alpha-fibrinogen, beta-fibrinogen, GP IIb/IIIa, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin 1-beta. Hypertension was the most important risk factor for ischemic stroke in our cohort [OR = 6.9, confidence interval (CI) 2.9-16.7, P < 0.0001]. Among all genes tested, the TNF-alpha gene variant exerted a significant, independent effect on individual predisposition to ischemic stroke occurrence (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.01-3.3, P < 0.05). Our findings, obtained in a cohort of young Italian patients, may support the existence of a direct contributory role of TNF-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine protein, in the susceptibility to brain damage.

herpes simplex virus	HSV	Latent herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been demonstrated in the trigeminal ganglia of experimentally infected rabbits between episodes of spontaneous ocular recurrence. In three experiments reported here, the normal pattern of recurrence was modified by manipulation of the trigeminal nerve and ganglion. Temporary retrobulbar disruption of trigeminal nerve function in chronically infected animals significantly decreased the number of ocular HSV isolations obtained during the 20 weeks immediately following surgery. Stereotaxic interruption of intracranial trigeminal nerve function prior to initial HSV infection dramatically reduced the incidence of peripheral recurrence of HSV. In chronically infected animals, stereotaxic stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion caused a marked increase in positive cultures within 2 days. These studies provide additional evidence for the theory that the reservoir for latent ocular HSV in rabbits is the trigeminal ganglion. Moreover, the studies suggest that the transmission of latent HSV from the trigeminal ganglion to its infectious form in the peripheral tissues involves the trigeminal nerve. We have shown that mechanical and stereotaxic stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is a reliable and rapid means of precipitating peripheral ocular shedding of HSV on command, a finding which should prove most productive in future research.
diabetic serum growth factor	DSGF	There are two different classes of humoral growth factors for arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells that age of potential relevance for the development of macrovascular disease inn diabetes mellitus: hormones (growth hormone, insulin like growth factor I and II, insulin) and locally released growth factors of platelet origin. The following hormones have to be considered: Increased growth hormone plasma levels might contribute to macrovascular disease, but its actual relevance remains to be determined. Insulin like growth factor I and II are present in vivo and stimulate growth of vascular cells in vitro but their relevance for macrovascular disease in diabetes is unproven. To insulin, see Dr. Stout's paper. Human platelets contain at least six growth peptides or proteins that all stimulate in vitro growth of arterial wall cells: platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet derived endothelial cell mitogen, endothelial growth factor, diabetic serum growth factor (DSGF), transforming growth factor-beta. As their plasma concentrations have not been shown to be increased in diabetes increased local availability at sites of stimulated platelet aggregation has been postulated. Therefore, their relevance for macrovascular disease i diabetics is based mainly on circumstantial evidence. The concentration of DSGF of platelet origin depends on the metabolic control: it increases in vivo in poorly controlled diabetics and is normalized after 2-3 weeks of good metabolic control in the same diabetic patient. The growth potency of DSGF from poorly controlled diabetics is greater than that of physiological amounts of insulin or growth hormone. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
monozygotic	MZ	Some health related psychosocial correlates of the Eysenck neuroticism scale were examined in a questionnaire study of 1501 monozygotic (MZ) and 3455 dizygotic (DZ) male twin pairs representing the adult male twin population in Finland. In analyses of the individuals, 34% of the variance in neuroticism was associated to: psychological variables (stress of daily activities, life satisfaction, quality of sleep, and extroversion - the explanatory rate of this variable set was 30%), psychotropic drugs (5%), alcohol use (4%), and smoking (2%). Neuroticism was also associated to social, life change, and medical variables. In pairwise analyses, the heritability estimate (h2) was 0.54 for pairs living together and 0.39 for pairs living apart. It seems that heritability estimates are confounded by the closer intrapair relationship between members of MZ than DZ pairs. In pairwise analyses, 23% of the intrapair difference of neuroticism in MZ pairs was associated to intrapair differences in the aforementioned variables. The following explanatory rates were found: psychological variables, 21%; psychotropic drugs, 2%; alcohol use, 2%; and smoking, 1%. Neuroticism of pairs discordant for background variables showed similar intrapair differences as between individuals in the following variables: service vs farming work, use of alcohol, use of antacids, hypertension, heavy physical work, quality of sleep, changes of workplace for negative reasons, smoking, and use of tranquillizers. It appears that in Finland environmental factors explain at least 61% of the variability in neuroticism, and that factors determining neuroticism are also associated to health related behavior such as smoking, use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs.

cerebellar granule neurons	CGNs	Caspase-3 enzyme activity is induced, and cell death follows, when cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) from 8-day-old rats are transferred from an extracellular concentration of 25 mM K+ (25 mM [K+]e) to 5 mM [K+]e. Death of these neurons is diminished by an inhibitor of caspase-3 but not by an inhibitor of caspase-1. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibit induction of caspase-3 and prevent death. Experiments in which CGN intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was manipulated by either changing [K+]e or adding a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel antagonist or a Ca2+ ionophore to the medium showed that caspase-3 mRNA rises 2.5-fold when [Ca2+]i is diminished from 300 to 150 nM, with a corresponding rise in peak caspase enzyme activity. Whereas the caspase-3 mRNA level does not rise further with a still greater diminution in [Ca2+]i, peak caspase enzyme activity continues to increase, reaching sevenfold induction when [Ca2+]i is reduced to 55 nM. In CGNs in which [Ca2+]i is set at 55 nM by incubation in 5 mM [K+]e, treatment with forskolin or dibutyryl 3',5'-cyclic adenosine-5'-monophosphate delays caspase-3 induction and diminishes death but does not alter [Ca2+]i. We conclude that, in immature CGNs, both caspase-3 transcription and the subsequent processing of caspase-3 are induced by a fall in [Ca2+]i. Elevating cyclic AMP content delays caspase-3 induction by a mechanism that does not require an increase in [Ca2+]i.
International Index of Erectile Function	IIEF	OBJECTIVE: We have conducted the following study to determine the prevalence of premature ejaculation in male hemodialysis patients and its impact on sexual quality of life. METHODS: This study was performed in hemodialysis facilities. Patients were asked to complete the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and also to report their ejaculation status. 98 male hemodialysis patients with normal potency were included in the study. The IIEF domain scores were determined, and the overall and relationship satisfaction rates were calculated for the patients with and without premature ejaculation separately. RESULTS: The mean age was 45.9 (range 30-69) years and the duration of hemodialysis was 37.8 (range 7-84) months. Premature ejaculation was determined in 31 (31.6%) patients. Patients with premature ejaculation experienced significantly lower overall satisfaction scores. Items of satisfaction with overall sexual life and sexual relationship with partner were responded to with a score of 'moderately satisfied' or 'very satisfied' in 47 and 53% of patients with premature ejaculation and 84 and 86% of patients without premature ejaculation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Premature ejaculation is a prevalent disorder in hemodialysis patients and seems to affect the satisfaction rate and sexual quality of life of these patients.
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue	BALT	Although the lung is not a lymphoid organ it contains large numbers of lymphocytes. These can be found in different compartments: (1) the pulmonary intravascular pool, which is organ-specific and shows a unique migration pattern; (2) the interstitial lymphocyte pool, which is equivalent in size to the whole blood pool; (3) the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) which develops as a result of microbial stimulation; (4) the intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes of the bronchi, with their typical subset composition; (5) the lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar space, which can be sampled by bronchoalveolar lavage. The size and kinetics of the lymphocyte pools have been studied in the pig in more detail than in most other species. Despite this organotypic compartmentalisation of the pulmonary lymphoid cells in the pig, the lung is part of the integrated mucosal immune system, as shown by protective oral immunisation against the lung-pathogenic bacteria Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The lung immune system in the pig is not only of veterinary interest, but also a relevant model for the human respiratory tract.
acetylgalactosamine-specific-lectin	mMGL	Recently, we have shown that mononuclear phagocytes comprise the majority of interstitial cells in the mouse dermis, as indicated by their phenotypic and functional characteristics. In particular, these cells express the mouse macrophage galactose-/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific-lectin (mMGL)/CD301, identified by the monoclonal antibody ER-MP23, as well as other macrophage markers. As expression of mMGL is induced by IL-4 or IL-13 and is therefore a marker of alternatively activated macrophages, we asked whether dermal mononuclear phagocytes are genuinely alternatively activated. We observed that these cells expressed, next to mMGL, two other alternative activation markers, namely, the mannose receptor/CD206 and Dectin-1. Yet, as this expression profile was similar in IL-4 receptor alpha knockout mice, neither IL-4 nor IL-13 signaling appeared to be required for this phenotype. We also found that Langerhans cells (LC), which showed only a low level of mMGL in the epidermis, up-regulated mMGL expression upon migration through the dermis, allowing these cells to internalize limited amounts of mMGL ligands. LC isolated from epidermal preparations did not show this up-regulation when cultured in standard medium, but whole skin-conditioned medium did stimulate mMGL expression by LC. The vast majority of mMGL molecules was present in the cytoplasm, however. LC, which arrived in skin-draining lymph nodes, quickly down-regulated mMGL expression, and dermally derived cells retained significant mMGL levels. Taken together, these data suggest that the dermal microenvironment induces mononuclear phagocyte subpopulations to express mMGL and possibly other markers of alternatively activated macrophages, independent of IL-4/IL-13 signaling.

human umbilical vein endothelial cells	HUVEC	PURPOSE: To perform an in vitro evaluation of electrostatic endothelial cell transplantation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) onto segments of 4 mm internal diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular prostheses. METHODS: This evaluation consisted of exposing vascular graft segments that had been subjected to either electrostatic or gravitation transplantation with HUVEC to a physiologic shear stress (15 dynes/cm2) under steady flow conditions within a flow loop system. Biochemical assays were performed on freshly transplanted grafts by means of radioimmunoassay for prostacyclin and thromboxane A2. RESULTS: There was a 30% loss of HUVEC after 30 minutes of shear stress exposure from the grafts subjected to gravitational transplantation with no additional significant (alpha = 0.05) loss after 120 minutes. Grafts subjected to electrostatic transplantation had no significant (alpha = 0.05) loss of HUVEC during exposure to physiologic shear stress. Furthermore, after 120 minutes of shear-stress exposure, the grafts subjected to electrostatic transplantation (78,420 +/- 6274 HUVEC/cm2) retained 2.3 times more HUVEC than the counterparts subjected to gravitational transplantation (34,427 +/- 4637 HUVEC/cm2). The biochemical assay results indicated no significant (alpha = 0.05) production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 regardless of the method of cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The electrostatic transplantation technique was superior to the gravitational transplantation technique in terms of cellular retention when the ePTFE grafts were exposed to physiologic shear stress. (2) Production of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 did not differ between transplanted HUVEC subjected to gravitational or electrostatic procedures.

National Research Network	NRN	Family physician's knowledge, beliefs, and self-reported practice patterns regarding hyperlipidemia: a National Research Network (NRN) survey.
National Cholesterol Education Program	NCEP	Objective: Family physicians have the potential to make a major impact on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease through the optimal assessment and management of hyperlipidemia. We were interested in assessing the knowledge, beliefs, and self-reported practice patterns of a representative sample of family physicians regarding the assessment and management of hyperlipidemia 2 years after the release of the evidence-based National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines. METHODS: A 33-item survey was mailed to a random sample (N = 1200) of members of the American Academy of Family Physicians in April of 2004, with 2 follow-up mailings to nonresponders. Physicians were queried about sociodemographic characteristics, their knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice patterns regarding the assessment and management of hyperlipidemia. Four case scenarios also were presented. RESULTS: Response rate was 58%. Over 90% of surveyed family physicians screened adults for hyperlipidemia as part of a cardiovascular disease prevention strategy. Most (89%) did this screening by themselves without the support of office staff, and 36% reported routine use of a flow sheet. Most had heard of the ATP III guidelines (85%), but only 13% had read them carefully. Only 17% of respondents used a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk calculator usually or always. Over 90% of those responding reported using low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the treatment goal but only 76% reported using non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as a secondary goal of therapy. CONCLUSION: We found a large variability in knowledge, beliefs, and practice patterns among practicing family physicians. We found general agreement on universal screening of adults for hyperlipidemia as part of cardiovascular disease prevention strategy and use of LDL cholesterol as a treatment goal. Many other aspects of the NCEP ATP III guidelines, such as use of a systematic, multidisciplinary approach, using non-HDL cholesterol as a secondary goal, routinely using a CHD risk calculator for risk assessment to guide cholesterol management, have not yet penetrated into self-reported clinical practice.

We found general agreement on universal screening of adults for hyperlipidemia as part of cardiovascular disease prevention strategy and use of LDL cholesterol as a treatment goal. Many other aspects of the NCEP ATP III guidelines, such as use of a systematic, multidisciplinary approach, using non-HDL cholesterol as a secondary goal, routinely using a CHD risk calculator for risk assessment to guide cholesterol management, have not yet penetrated into self-reported clinical practice.
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk calculator usually or always.	CHD	Objective: Family physicians have the potential to make a major impact on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease through the optimal assessment and management of hyperlipidemia. We were interested in assessing the knowledge, beliefs, and self-reported practice patterns of a representative sample of family physicians regarding the assessment and management of hyperlipidemia 2 years after the release of the evidence-based National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines. METHODS: A 33-item survey was mailed to a random sample (N = 1200) of members of the American Academy of Family Physicians in April of 2004, with 2 follow-up mailings to nonresponders. Physicians were queried about sociodemographic characteristics, their knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice patterns regarding the assessment and management of hyperlipidemia. Four case scenarios also were presented. RESULTS: Response rate was 58%. Over 90% of surveyed family physicians screened adults for hyperlipidemia as part of a cardiovascular disease prevention strategy. Most (89%) did this screening by themselves without the support of office staff, and 36% reported routine use of a flow sheet. Most had heard of the ATP III guidelines (85%), but only 13% had read them carefully. Only 17% of respondents used a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk calculator usually or always. Over 90% of those responding reported using low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the treatment goal but only 76% reported using non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as a secondary goal of therapy.

event-related potentials	ERPs	Whether late positive components of event-related potentials (ERPs) parallel changes in heart rate (HR) indicative of attention/orienting to rare stimuli has been debated. In the present study, a three-stimulus design was used, with rare target, rare nontarget, and frequent standard stimuli delivered under identical conditions except that instructions to subjects described the targets to which subjects should respond but did not describe the nontargets. In Experiment 1, stimuli varied among modalities; in Experiment 2, auditory stimuli were employed. Both ERPs and HR were consistent with automatic processing preceding two stages of controlled processing. Rare stimuli evoked larger parietal P300 and initial HR deceleration than standards. Presumably because of load-reducing effects of long interstimulus intervals, targets and nontargets were not distinguished before a late slow wave and a late phase of HR acceleration. Neither rare stimulus elicited a recognizable frontal P3a.

adenosine 5'-triphosphate	ATP	1. A model of controlled hypoxia in the isolated perfused rat kidney has been used to compare the extent of reduction in the steady-state level of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) from that initially observed with alterations in renal function and with the development of tubular cell injury. 2. ATP depletion was observed in response to decreased total oxygen delivery even when delivery greatly exceeded consumption and the venous oxygen tension remained in excess of 150 mmHg. 3. Increases in the fractional excretion of sodium occurred progressively below an apparent threshold value of whole kidney ATP of approximately 80% of the baseline. 4. With modestly decreased oxygen delivery, cellular injury was confined to deep proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Severely decreased oxygen delivery rates were associated with cellular damage spreading throughout the cortex. 5. Even the smallest reductions in whole kidney ATP were associated with morphological damage to tubular cells. The extent of reduction in whole kidney ATP was closely correlated and approximately equivalent to the calculated volume of injured cells. 6. Our results indicate that reduction in whole kidney ATP during decreased oxygen delivery is a valid marker of the extent of injurious cellular hypoxia and are consistent with the view that cellular ATP concentrations in hypoxia are markedly inhomogeneous. They support the hypothesis that specific regions of the perfused kidney become critically hypoxic and develop cellular injury while overall oxygen delivery remains high. Areas at risk include deep proximal tubule as well as the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop.
angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy	AILD	A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease). Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful. Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma. Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma. These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations. This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.
insulin-like growth factor binding protein	IGFBP	The binding kinetics of human insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 1-6 for recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II were measured and compared in the present study using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technique. Different concentrations of IGFBPs (5-100 nM) were allowed to interact with the immobilized IGF-I or IGF-II on sensor chip surface. Both des(1-3)IGF-I and insulin are known to bind weakly to the IGFBPs and therefore are used as negative controls for the binding experiments. The resultant sensorgrams were analyzed by using simple 1:1 binding model to derive both the association rate (k(a)) and dissociation rate (k(d)) constants for IGFBP-IGF interactions. The k(a) values of IGFBPs are in the range of 1x10(4) to 9x10(5) M(-1) s(-1) for IGF-I and 7x10(3) to 1.7x10(6) M(-1) s(-1) for IGF-II, respectively. The orders of k(a) for both IGF-I and IGF-II are IGFBP-3>IGFBP-5>IGFBP-6>IGFBP-4>IGFBP-2>++ +IGFBP-1. The k(d) values of IGFBPs are in the range of 1.5x10(-5) to 2x10(-4) s(-1) for IGF-I and 3.6x10(-5) to 3.7x10(-4) s(-1) for IGF-II, respectively. The order of k(d) for IGF-I is IGFBP-6>IGFBP-5>IGFBP-4>IGFBP-3>IGFBP-2>++ +IGFBP-1 and that for IGF-II is IGFBP-5>IGFBP-6>IGFBP-2>IGFBP-4>IGFBP-3>++ +IGFBP-1, respectively. The equilibrium affinity constants (K(A)) were calculated based on the ratio of k(a)/k(d) and were more precise than the published literature values based on competitive radioligand binding assays. The systematic study enables a direct comparison on the IGF-binding properties among the various IGFBPs, and the kinetic data provide additional information to delineate the physiological role of different IGFBPs in vivo.

Aplysia parietovisceral ganglion	PVG	The identified giant neurons R3-R14 in the Aplysia parietovisceral ganglion (PVG) have a rapid, Na+-dependent and Hg2+-sensitive uptake system for glycine not found in neighboring neurons. In autoradiographs of PVG incubated in [3H]glycine (glutaraldehyde fix), the cytoplasms of R3-R14 have 3--4 times more silver grains (No./100 sq.micrometer) than other neurons. The glycine uptake system in R3-R14 is selective (alanine, serine, leucine, and proline are taken up equally by all neurons) and is unaffected by reserpine and anisomycin. Neurons R3-R14 contain 2 times less label when ganglia are fixed in formaldehyde than when glutaraldehyde is used as a fixative. Because formaldehyde fixes free amino acids poorly, much of the glycine taken up by R3-R14 is, therefore, not incorporated into protein. In autoradiographs of PVG incubated in [3H]glycine, silver grains are distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of R3-R14; no association of the grains with the dense core granules characteristic of these neurons7 or other cellular components was found. In contrast, grains in the neurosecretory "bag cells" of the PVG were clustered in numerous discrete areas of the cytoplasm (Golgi complex areas) and the nucleus was only sparsely labeled. The existence of a rapid and selective glycine uptake system in R3-R14, together with their high endogenous glycine concentrations17, suggests that glycine may be a neurotransmitter in these neurons.
Intracranial venous thrombosis	ICVT	BACKGROUND: Intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) commonly presents with seizures in the acute period, and some patients may develop recurrent seizures in the long term. The prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the management of post-ICVT seizures is controversial and there is currently no consensus on the optimal management of post-ICVT seizures. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of AEDs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures related to ICVT. (1) Do AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in patients who have had an ICVT but have not had a seizure? (2) Do AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in patients who have had an ICVT and at least one seizure? SEARCH STRATEGY: We aimed to identify relevant studies in the Cochrane Epilepsy Group and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Registers. We also undertook specialised searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE, and checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from the searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in which patients were assigned to a treatment group (that is, receiving at least one AED) or control group (receiving placebo or no drug). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both review authors independently screened and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. If studies had been included, then one review author would have extracted the data and the other would have checked the extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: No relevant studies were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs for the primary or secondary prevention of seizures related to intracranial venous thrombosis. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to inform practice.

release probability	p	CA3-CA1 glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus exhibit a large heterogeneity in release probability (p) and paired-pulse (PP) plasticity, established already in the early neonatal period when the CA3-CA1 connections consist of only a single release site. At such a site two factors decide initial release probability: the number of immediately releasable vesicles (preprimed pool) and the vesicle release probability (P(ves1)). Depletion and replenishment of this pool, an alteration in P(ves), and desensitization of postsynaptic receptors may contribute to PP plasticity. A model based on data from single neonatal CA3-CA1 synapses has been used to address the relative importance of these factors for the heterogeneity in PP plasticity. At a 20 msec PP interval, the PP ratio (P(2)/P(1)) varied from 0.1 to 4.5 among the synapses. At this interval desensitization and replenishment were of little importance. The heterogeneity was explained mostly by the variation in P(ves1), whereas the preprimed pool size was of minor importance. P(ves) altered from the first to the second stimulus such that P(ves2) was rather uniform among the synapses. Its variation thus contributed little to the heterogeneity in PP ratio. The model also shows that the relationship between alterations in release probability and PP ratio is complex. Thus, an increase in release probability can be associated with an increase, a decrease, or no change at all in PP ratio, depending on the original values of P(ves1) and the preprimed pool and on which one of these factors is altered to produce the increase in release probability.

Almost Perfect Scale-Revised	APS-R	In this study of the discriminant, convergent, and incremental validity of the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R), university students completed the APS-R, additional measures of perfectionism, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-Form S, and measures of self-esteem and depression. The results revealed expected significant, but not completely overlapping, associations between the APS-R Discrepancy subscale scores and the Five-Factor Model of Personality (FFM) dimension of Neuroticism, and between the APS-R High Standards and Order subscales and the FFM dimension of Conscientiousness. The incremental validity of APS-R scores over FFM dimensions was supported in analyses of self-esteem but not depression. The implications of these findings for further psychometric and clinical studies of perfectionism and facets of FFM dimensions are discussed.
stilbene disulphonate	DIDS	Iodide uptake by primary cultures of turtle thyroid follicular cells is directly proportional to the Na+ concentration and is inversely proportional to the HCO3- concentration in culture medium, but is not affected by the Cl- concentration. Addition of 4,4'-di-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulphonate (DIDS; 10 mumol/l and higher doses) to medium containing different concentrations of Na+ (5-140 mmol/l), HCO3- (0-40 mmol/l) and Cl- (120 mmol/l) generally enhanced iodide uptake by the cultured cells; however, there was no significant effect in Na+-free and in low Cl- (90 mmol/l and less) medium. The inhibitory effects on iodide uptake of ouabain, frusemide and perchlorate were attenuated by DIDS which also antagonized the stimulatory effects on iodide uptake of TSH, although both DIDS and TSH increased the 125I- cell/medium ratio when they were given alone. At doses of 100 mumol/l and higher, DIDS lowered the intracellular pH of cultured cells when the pH of the medium was maintained at a constant level. It also increased the intracellular Cl- concentration, but had no effect on intracellular Na+ or K+. The input and specific resistances of cell membranes in cultured thyroid cells and in isolated thyroid slices increased (decreased conductance) after adding DIDS to the perfusion fluids. Both Na+/K+- and HCO3(-)-ATPase activities in homogenates of turtle thyroid tissue were inhibited by DIDS. Results from this investigation demonstrate (1) that in addition to preventing the leak of iodide from thyroid cells, DIDS may act to increase the sensitivity of the Na+-anion carrier to I- and thereby increases iodide uptake, and (2) that a HCO3(-)-Cl- exchange system is present in the thyroid cell membrane and appears to be linked to the transport of iodide into thyroid cells.
sex hormone-binding globulin	SHBG	In a population survey of gallstones, the serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-gonadal axis and the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were compared in subjects with cholesterol gallstones and in a control group. In 84 subjects who entered the survey, echographic gallstones that had been identified at the survey, turned out to be radiolucent or mixed (predominantly of cholesterol) at subsequent x-ray. The controls were without gallstones at echography, matched to the cases for potential confounders of the association sex hormones-cholelithiasis. Testosterone (T) 17-beta-estradiol (E2), 17-OH progesterone (P), and SHBG were dosed by radioimmunoassay; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (Prl) by dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoro immunoassay (DELFIA). Men with gallstones had lower LH than controls (n = 34, median difference = -0.62 mU/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.20 to -0.26 mU/ml, paired sign test, p = 0.003). Premenopausal women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with gallstones had higher E2 than controls (n = 7, median difference: +117, pg/ml, 95% CI: +10 to +218 pg/ml, p = 0.008). Postmenopausal women had lower LH than controls (n = 35, median difference = -4.57 mU/ml, 95% CI -9.5 to -1.0 mU/ml, p = 0.04). No other hormones showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls, in either males or females. The findings of this exploratory study in subjects with radiolucent and mixed gallstones suggest that men and postmenopausal women have lower LH, and premenopausal women in the luteal phase of the cycle have higher E2, than controls.

Testosterone (T) 17-beta-estradiol (E2), 17-OH progesterone (P), and SHBG were dosed by radioimmunoassay; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (Prl) by dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoro immunoassay (DELFIA). Men with gallstones had lower LH than controls (n = 34, median difference = -0.62 mU/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.20 to -0.26 mU/ml, paired sign test, p = 0.003). Premenopausal women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with gallstones had higher E2 than controls (n = 7, median difference: +117, pg/ml, 95% CI: +10 to +218 pg/ml, p = 0.008). Postmenopausal women had lower LH than controls (n = 35, median difference = -4.57 mU/ml, 95% CI -9.5 to -1.0 mU/ml, p = 0.04). No other hormones showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls, in either males or females. The findings of this exploratory study in subjects with radiolucent and mixed gallstones suggest that men and postmenopausal women have lower LH, and premenopausal women in the luteal phase of the cycle have higher E2, than controls.

organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis	OVLT	Igf2 and H19 are reciprocally imprinted genes that are closely linked and coexpressed in tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origin. Here we report that coexpression of these genes is also found in specific fetal tissues of neuroectodermal origin, that is in the ventral midline region of both the hindbrain and spinal cord. For cells of neuroectodermal origin, complete absence of Igf2 and H19 transcription was previously described. Analysis of allele-specific expression of both Igf2 and H19 in the ventral midline region of the hindbrain shows that H19 is expressed monoallelically, with the paternal allele being silent, whereas Igf2 is expressed biallelically. Furthermore, we observed a strong influence of the parental species background, in that the Mus musculus allele was always expressed at higher levels than the M. spretus allele. This was observed when the M. spretus allele was contributed by the mother or by the father. An analysis of Igf2 methylation by bisulphite genomic sequencing provided no clear answer as to whether Igf2 expression and methylation are linked in a tissue of neuroectodermal origin. Taken together, our results provide novel information on H19 and Igf2 expression and imprinting patterns in the fetal mouse brain. In addition, they indicate that some aspects of Igf2 regulation in cells of neuroectodermal origin do not follow the pattern that exists in mesoderm- and endoderm-derived tissues. Apart from the ventral midline region, H19 and Igf2 were found to be coexpressed in the ectodermally derived Rathke's pouch and in some circumventricular organs of the brain, such as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the pineal gland.
Bacterial artificial chromosome	BAC	Identification of genetic losses and gains is valuable in analysis of brain tumors. Locus-by-locus analyses have revealed correlations between prognosis and response to chemotherapy and loss or gain of specific genes and loci. These approaches are labor intensive and do not provide a global view of the genetic changes within the tumor cells. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays, which cover the genome with an average resolution of less than 1 MbP, allow defining the sum total of these genetic changes in a single comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiment. These changes are directly overlaid on the human genome sequence, thus providing the extent of the amplification or deletion, reflected by a megabase position, and gene content of the abnormal region. Although this array-based CGH approach (CGHa) seems to detect the extent of the genetic changes in tumors reliably, it has not been robustly tested. We compared genetic changes in four newly derived, early-passage glioma cell lines, using spectral karyotyping (SKY) and CGHa. Chromosome changes seen in cell lines under SKY analysis were also detected with CGHa. In addition, CGHa detected cryptic genetic gains and losses and resolved the nature of subtle marker chromosomes that could not be resolved with SKY, thus providing distinct advantages over previous technologies. There was remarkable general concordance between the CGHa results comparing the cell lines to the original tumor, except that the magnitude of the changes seen in the tumor sample was generally suppressed compared with the cell lines, a consequence of normal cells contaminating the tumor sample. CGHa revealed changes in cell lines that were not present in the original tumors and vice versa, even when analyzed at the earliest passage possible, which highlights the adaptation of the cells to in vitro culture. CGHa proved to be highly accurate and efficient for identifying genetic changes in tumor cells. This approach can accurately identify subtle, novel genetic abnormalities in tumors directly linked to the human genome sequence. CGHa far surpasses the resolution and information provided by conventional metaphase CGH, without relying on in vitro culture of tumors for metaphase spreads.

horseradish peroxidase	HRP	In adult dd-mice, response of peritoneal free cells to either horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or glutaraldehyde-fixed erythrocytes were examined by electron microscopy. As reported previously (ABE et al., 1979), peritoneal free cells are classified into three types: type I, II and III cells. Type I cells are small lymphocytes, type II cells are medium-sized mononuclear cells, and type III cells are macrophages. The amount of HRP taken up is very large in type III cells. The cells contain numerous vacuoles filled with HRP. Type I and II cells also have vesicles containing HRP. The vesicles are fewer in type I cells than in type II. Type III cells rapidly enclose erythrocytes by thin cytoplasmic flaps and then ingest several erythrocytes. In type III cells, a labyrinth of ramifying tubes seen in the peripheral cytoplasm may serve as a reserve of the membrane system for allowing a rapid coverage and internalization of large foreign materials. A part of type II cells attach to erythrocytes and take them by a varying depth of invagination. Type I cells do not respond to erythrocytes at all. In conclusion, the three types of peritoneal cells can be differentiated by their response to foreign materials as well as by their cytologic features.
hormone replacement therapy	HRT	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after treatment for breast cancer is associated with increased risk of recurrence and mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Postmenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated by five Sydney doctors between 1964 and 1999. OUTCOME MEASURES: Times from diagnosis to cancer recurrence or new breast cancer, to death from all causes and to death from primary tumour were compared between women who used HRT for menopausal symptoms after diagnosis and those who did not. Relative risks (RRs) were determined from Cox regression analyses, adjusted for patient and tumour characteristics. RESULTS: 1122 women were followed up for 0-36 years (median, 6.08 years); 154 were lost to follow-up. 286 women used HRT for menopausal symptoms for up to 26 years (median, 1.75 years). Compared with non-users, HRT users had reduced risk of cancer recurrence (adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.87), all-cause mortality (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19-0.59) and death from primary tumour (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.72). Continuous combined HRT was associated with a reduced risk of death from primary tumour (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88) and all-cause mortality (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.73). CONCLUSION: HRT use for menopausal symptoms by women treated for primary invasive breast cancer is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence or shortened life expectancy.

Crohn's disease	CD	BACKGROUND AND AIM: In Crohn's disease (CD), epidemiological data and animal studies suggest that vitamin D (vitD) has protective immune-modulating properties. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone (DEX) induce interleukin (IL)-10 productions in healthy controls (HC) T cells. We studied if 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with and without DEX could induce IL-10 production, downregulate pro-inflammatory Interferon (IFN)-gamma and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha production, and influence cell kinetics in peripheral CD4+ T cells from CD patients. METHODS: CD4+ T cells were separated from peripheral blood from CD patients and HC. Cells were activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and/or DEX. Cytokine levels, proliferation, and apoptosis were measured following 7 days of culture. RESULTS: In T cells from CD patients, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and DEX increased IL-10 production from a median of 0.08 ng/ml to 0.2 ng/ml (p<0.01) and downregulated IFN-gamma production from 8.3 ng/ml to 3.1 ng/ml (p<0.01). The induced IL-10 increase in cultures from HC (0.2 ng/ml to 1.0 ng/ml, p<0.01) was significantly higher than in CD patients (p<0.05). In CD cultures, the IL-4 production increased from 0.3 ng/ml to 0.5 ng/ml (p<0.01) and IL-6 production from 2.5 ng/ml to 6.1 ng/ml (p<0.05). Similar changes in cytokine levels were observed with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 independently of DEX. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and DEX decreased proliferation and reduced viability of T cells. CONCLUSION: We found that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with and without DEX stimulation increased IL-10 and reduced IFN-gamma production. These findings suggest that vitD may play a therapeutic role in CD.

These findings suggest that vitD may play a therapeutic role in CD.
pro-inflammatory Interferon	IFN	BACKGROUND AND AIM: In Crohn's disease (CD), epidemiological data and animal studies suggest that vitamin D (vitD) has protective immune-modulating properties. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone (DEX) induce interleukin (IL)-10 productions in healthy controls (HC) T cells. We studied if 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with and without DEX could induce IL-10 production, downregulate pro-inflammatory Interferon (IFN)-gamma and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha production, and influence cell kinetics in peripheral CD4+ T cells from CD patients. METHODS: CD4+ T cells were separated from peripheral blood from CD patients and HC. Cells were activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and/or DEX. Cytokine levels, proliferation, and apoptosis were measured following 7 days of culture. RESULTS: In T cells from CD patients, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and DEX increased IL-10 production from a median of 0.08 ng/ml to 0.2 ng/ml (p<0.01) and downregulated IFN-gamma production from 8.3 ng/ml to 3.1 ng/ml (p<0.01). The induced IL-10 increase in cultures from HC (0.2 ng/ml to 1.0 ng/ml, p<0.01) was significantly higher than in CD patients (p<0.05). In CD cultures, the IL-4 production increased from 0.3 ng/ml to 0.5 ng/ml (p<0.01) and IL-6 production from 2.5 ng/ml to 6.1 ng/ml (p<0.05). Similar changes in cytokine levels were observed with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 independently of DEX. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and DEX decreased proliferation and reduced viability of T cells. CONCLUSION: We found that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with and without DEX stimulation increased IL-10 and reduced IFN-gamma production. These findings suggest that vitD may play a therapeutic role in CD.

breastfeeding peer counseling	PC	The authors analyzed data from a trial assessing the efficacy of breastfeeding peer counseling (PC) for increasing exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) to (1) examine whether different ethnic groups responded differently to the intervention and (2) document the determinants of EBF. At 2 months postpartum, the prevalence of EBF in the intervention group was 11.4% among Puerto Ricans compared to 44.4% among non-Puerto Ricans (P = .008). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that women who had the intention prenatally to engage in EBF were more likely to do so and those whose mothers lived in the United States were less likely to engage in EBF at hospital discharge. At 2 months postpartum, mothers who were breastfed as children were more likely to engage in EBF, whereas non-Puerto Ricans had a significantly greater response to the intervention than Puerto Ricans (odds ratio, 6.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-28.33). There is a need for further studies to determine why different ethnic groups respond differently to EBF promotion interventions.

gastroesophageal reflux disease	GERD	AIM OF THE REVIEW AND METHODS: This review brings together information on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Published manuscripts were identified from Medline. The articles were then screened for relevance prior to inclusion in the review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Up to 40% of people in Western countries are estimated to regularly experience heartburn, the most characteristic symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Treatment options available for GERD range from over-the-counter (OTC) antacids to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and anti-reflux surgery. Many patients self-medicate with OTC medications such as antacids and low-dose histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) to relieve episodic or food-related symptoms of GERD, and may not seek medical advice unless symptoms persist or worsen. However, GERD is a chronic disease that frequently affects health-related quality of life and, if not properly managed, the complications of GERD may include erosive oesophagitis (EO), Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma. Adequate control of acid secretion is key to the successful treatment of the condition. OTC medications provide effective symptom relief to about one quarter of patients suffering from GERD. H2RAs can also provide effective symptomatic relief, particularly in patients with milder GERD, but become less-effective over time. PPIs are the agents of choice for the suppression of gastric acid production and have become the mainstay of therapy for acid-related diseases. PPIs produce significantly faster and more complete symptomatic relief, significantly faster and more complete healing of erosive GERD compared with H2RAs and are also significantly more effective at preventing relapse of EO. There are a number of existing guidelines for the treatment of GERD. Recommendation for initial therapy consist of general measures, such as lifestyle advice in combination with antacids and/or alginates. When general measures fail, the next step is empirical therapy. Two options exist for the expirical treatment of GERD, so-called "step-up" or "step-down" therapy. There are no clear data to support either treatment strategy as a universal approach to all patients; consequently, physicians must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient.

normal pressure hydrocephalus	NPH	Ventricular reduction after shunting for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) was classified on the basis of magnitude and rate of reduction in 35 adult patients. Brain compliance and resistance to outflow of cerebrospinal fluid (RCSF) were determined before shunting. Rapid and marked ventricular reduction (n = 11) was associated with a significantly lower compliance than slow and moderate to marked (n = 16) or minimal to mild (n = 8) reduction. Otherwise ventricular size before as well as after shunting did not correlate with compliance or RCSF. It is concluded that both rate and magnitude of ventricular reduction after shunting for NPH vary widely. Reduced compliance seems to be the best predictor of rapid and marked reduction.
Continuous relative phase	CRP	The purpose of this study was to examine both the intralimb (within a limb) and interlimb (between the right and left limbs) adaptations that occur in response to a unilaterally applied leg load as subjects walked at their preferred walking speed. It was hypothesized that this adaptation would alter interlimb coordination while intralimb coordination remained invariant. Subjects (n = 12) were required to walk on a treadmill at preferred walking speed. Bilateral 3-D kinematic data were collected while a load placed on the leg was increased. Gait adaptations to leg-loading were assessed through changes in coordination patterns between specific limb couplings. Continuous relative phase (CRP) was used to evaluate changes in limb coordination under each experimental load condition compared to a no load baseline condition. Both changes in magnitude of CRP (root-mean-square (RMS) analysis) as well as temporal changes in CRP across the stride cycle (cross-correlation) were assessed. Cross-Correlation values changed with load for all interlimb couplings assessed suggesting alterations in interlimb coordination across the stride cycle. CRP cross-correlation values were close to 1.0 in all the intralimb couplings examined, showing a relative invariance in intralimb coordination. Coordination changes in RMS were also observed for the interlimb couplings. RMS changes were also observed in the intralimb couplings on the loaded side. It appears that gait adaptations to a unilaterally applied leg load appear both at the intralimb and interlimb level. However, the majority of changes did appear at the interlimb level, where CRP as assessed through both cross-correlation and RMS measures changed. This study supports previous results that suggested a tighter coupling exists at the intralimb level, leaving the majority of gait adaptations to occur at the interlimb level. The observed adaptation in differences between interlimb and intralimb coordination may provide insight into gait adaptations in pathological gait.

magnetic resonance imaging	MRI	BACKGROUND: The cause of pain in osteoarthritis is unknown. Bone has pain fibers, and marrow lesions, which are thought to represent edema, have been noted in osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bone marrow lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with pain in knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PATIENTS: 401 persons (mean age, 66.8 years) with knee osteoarthritis on radiography who were drawn from clinics in the Veterans Administration health care system and from the community. Of these persons, 351 had knee pain and 50 had no knee pain. MEASUREMENTS: Knee radiography and MRI of one knee were performed in all participants. Those with knee pain quantified the severity of their pain. On MRI, coronal T(2)-weighted fat-saturated images were used to score the size of bone marrow lesions, and each knee was characterized as having any lesion or any large lesion. The prevalence of lesions and large lesions in persons with and without knee pain was compared; in participants with knee pain, the presence of lesions was correlated with severity of pain. RESULTS: Bone marrow lesions were found in 272 of 351 (77.5%) persons with painful knees compared with 15 of 50 (30%) persons with no knee pain (P < 0.001). Large lesions were present almost exclusively in persons with knee pain (35.9% vs. 2%; P < 0.001). After adjustment for severity of radiographic disease, effusion, age, and sex, lesions and large lesions remained associated with the occurrence of knee pain. Among persons with knee pain, bone marrow lesions were not associated with pain severity. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow lesions on MRI are strongly associated with the presence of pain in knee osteoarthritis.
vomeronasal organ	VNO	The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is known to be present in bats of the family Phyllostomidae, but in most species this is inferred from the presence of accessory olfactory bulbs. Like primates, bats have profound intergroup variations in the vomeronasal system. Of the family Phyllostomidae (49 genera, 143 species) the VNO of approximately 60 species has been studied. Here, we report light microscopic observations of the VNO of Anoura geoffroyi (fetus and adult), A. caudifer, and A. cultrata, as well as ultrastructural observations of the VNO in adult A. geoffroyi. The organ is crescent-shaped, with a wide lumen encroached by a "mushroom body" that contains a venous sinus. In adults, the vomeronasal cartilage is reduced, being longer in absolute length in fetal A. geoffroyi compared with the adult. In the neuroepithelium, the receptor cell microvilli are dark, distinct, and short, emerging from a vesicular tuft; the supporting cell microvilli are relatively much longer. Large paravomeronasal ganglia are observed. The receptor-free epithelium is undulating and lacks cilia or microvilli. Some characteristics of the VNO in Anoura have not been reported in other chiropterans to date, such as the marked reduction of the vomeronasal cartilage and absence of cilia in the receptor-free epithelium. Moreover, if A. geoffroyi is representative, the genus has an adult neuroepithelial volume similar to other mammals of its body size. Further examination of uninvestigated phyllostomid VNOs may elucidate a phylogenetic history of the family, as well as ecological or social correlates of the VNO in the order Chiroptera.
health-related quality of life	HRQL	BACKGROUND: Because the surgical treatment of achalasia is directed at the palliation of chronic symptoms, it is important to assess how surgery affects patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). METHODS: We evaluated upper gastrointestinal symptoms, satisfaction, and HRQL in 19 patients with achalasia before and after undergoing a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and partial fundoplication. HRQL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 40 years (range 16 to 74), and 58% were men. After a median follow-up of 21 months (range 2 to 35), 12 of 16 patients were satisfied with the results of their surgery. Liquid and solid dysphagia scores were improved after surgery, and the prevalence of heartburn symptoms did not change. Although all the health concepts measured by the SF-36 instrument showed some improvement, statistically significant increases (on a 0 to 100 scale) were detected in physical functioning (11.1, P = 0.02), role-physical (25.0, P = 0.05), bodily pain (12.2, P = 0.01), vitality (13.7, P = 0.02), and social functioning (18.4, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Most aspects of HRQL improve after a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and partial fundoplication for achalasia.
nerve growth factor	NGF	During development and regeneration of the nervous system, growth cones of the various nerve cells navigate and direct neurite elongation by detecting and responding to cues in the environment. To investigate changes in growth cone behaviour due to calcium influx we used nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced growth cones of PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma cells) cells as a model. High external concentrations of potassium and ATP depress growth cone motility, induce club-shaped growth cones and reduce filopodia length and the number and relative F-actin contents of single growth cones (r.a.c.), respectively. The cellular responses are mediated by a sustained increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) as monitored by calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes and confocal microfluorimetry. The responses are not detectable in the presence of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Immunocytochemistry revealed an increased level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cell bodies and growth cones but not in cell nuclei. Paxillin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein located in neurites and growth cones, was detected among the phosphotyrosine proteins. The sustained (> 30 s) Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated L-type but not N- or P-type Ca2+ channels induced the F-actin loss and tyrosine phosphorylation. Ca2+ entry through P2X2 ligand-gated channels caused the same effects. Our data suggest the following mechanism: increased [Ca2+]i levels activate tyrosine kinases located close to the ion channels which then leads to changes in morphology due to tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, e. g. paxillin.
nuclear location signal	NLS	Transcription factor NF-kappa B is a central regulator of inflammatory, immune and acute phase reactions. It rapidly initiates the transcription of a wide variety of target genes in response to various pathogenic stimuli. Because NF-kappa B is predominantly controlled at a posttranscriptional level through association with the inhibitory I kappa B subunits, its activation cannot be monitored directly at a cellular level by means of detecting new mRNA or protein synthesis. In this study, we describe a monoclonal antibody, designated alpha-p65MAb, that recognizes an epitope which includes the nuclear location signal (NLS) of p65, the DNA binding subunit mainly responsible for the strong gene-inductory potential of NF-kappa B. alpha-p65MAb recognized human and rodent p65 only when I kappa B alpha was not bound to p65. Thus, the IgG3 selectively stained the activated, nuclear form of NF-kappa B in cultured cells. Unlike I kappa B, the MAb and its Fab fragments did not inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B in mobility shift assays. We show that alpha-p65MAb is suitable to study the activation state of NF-kappa B in cryosections of tissues.
diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma	DPDL	During a 3-year period 39 evaluable patients with stage III and IV non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and unfavorable histologies were treated with a unique chemotherapeutic regimen based on a modified CHOP combination to which was added the nitrosourea, CCNU. Complete response was observed in six of 15 (40%) patients with diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (DPDL), four of 11 (36%) with diffuse mixed histiocytic lymphocytic (DML), and seven of 13 (54%) with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL). Of the 17 patients who achieved complete response, nine (53%) have remained continuously disease-free for greater than 2.5 years (2.7-4.1 years) from the onset of therapy: four of six with DPDL, two of four with DML, and three of seven with DHL. Median survival was 18.9 months for all patients, 18.9 months for those with DPDL, 17.4 months for those with DML, and 9.7 months for those with DHL. The median survival has not been reached for patients who attained a complete response, and will exceed 3.3 years. Central nervous system relapse was observed in three patients. In general, toxicity was moderate and consisted primarily of leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxicity. There were no drug-related deaths. The addition of CCNU to a modified CHOP combination resulted in an effective, generally well-tolerated out-patient regimen. However, it did not appear to decrease the rate of CNS relapse or improve current treatment results observed with other adriamycin-containing regimens for similar patients.

We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb. The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6. As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated. The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice. The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb. We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb. Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man.
Fas ligand	FasL	Fas ligand (FasL) is a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family. Its binding to the cognate Fas receptor triggers the apoptosis that plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. The cell death-inducing property of FasL has been associated with its extracellular domain, which can be cleaved off by metalloprotease activity to produce soluble FasL. The fate of the remaining membrane-anchored N-terminal part of the FasL molecule has not been determined. Here we show that post-translational processing of overexpressed and endogenous FasL in T-cells by the disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM10 generates a 17-kDa N-terminal fragment, which lacks the receptor-binding extracellular domain. This FasL remnant is membrane anchored and further processed by SPPL2a, a member of the signal peptide peptidase-like family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases. SPPL2a cleavage liberates a smaller and highly unstable fragment mainly containing the intracellular FasL domain (FasL ICD). We show that this fragment translocates to the nucleus and is capable of inhibiting gene transcription. With ADAM10 and SPPL2a we have identified two proteases implicated in FasL processing and release of the FasL ICD, which has been shown to be important for retrograde FasL signaling.
Arginine-rich protein	ARP	Arginine-rich protein (ARP) is a highly conserved gene that maps to human chromosomal band 3p21.1. This gene contains an imperfect trinucleotide repeat which encodes a string of arginines. We previously detected a specific mutation (ATG50-->AGG) within this region of the gene in 10 of 21 sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Here, we report the detection of the same mutation in 5 of 21 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, 1 of 2 small cell lung cancer cell lines, 6 of 18 non-small cell lung carcinomas, 9 of 22 breast tumors, and 5 of 13 prostate tumors. This mutation was seen in several early stage tumors and may thus be an early event in tumorigenesis. We also detected a mutation at codon 53 of this gene in both primary and metastatic tumors from one patient. Other nucleotide changes were observed in a few PCR subclones, but their frequency was the same in both tumor and control samples, suggesting that many of these changes were PCR or subcloning artifacts rather than mutations in the tumor cells themselves.
Nitric oxide	NO	Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in adipose tissue biology by influencing adipogenesis, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and lipolysis. The enzymes responsible for NO formation in adipose cells are endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), whereas neuronal NO synthase (bNOS) is not expressed in adipocytes. We characterized the expression pattern and the influence of adipogenesis, obesity, and weight loss on genes belonging to the NO system in human subcutaneous adipose cells by combining in vivo and in vitro studies. Expression of most of the genes known to belong to the NO system (eNOS, iNOS, subunits of the soluble guanylate cyclase, and both genes encoding cGMP-dependent protein kinases) in human adipose tissue and isolated human adipocytes was detected. In vitro adipogenic differentiation increased the expression level of iNOS significantly, whereas eNOS expression levels were not influenced. The genes encoding eNOS, iNOS, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 were expressed at higher levels in obese women. Expression of these genes, however, was not influenced by 5% weight loss. Insulin and angiotensin II (Ang II) increased NO production by human preadipocytes in vitro. Increased eNOS and iNOS expression in adipocytes and local effects of insulin and Ang II may increase adipose tissue production of NO in obesity.

polyelectrolyte solution	PES	The influence of the platelet-activating factor receptor-antagonist (BN 52021) and polyelectrolyte solution (PES) on the morphology and oxidant-antioxidant equilibrium in the gastrointestinal wall in hemorrhagic shock was examined in rats. The animals were divided into five groups: I - control, II - sham operation, III - untreated hemorrhagic shock lasting 75 minutes, IV - shock treated with PES, and V - shock treated with BN 52021 and PES. The most expressed morphological changes were found in the small intestine in group IV (shock treated with PES) and in group III (untreated shock). Morphological changes were well correlated with the malondialdehyde (MDA) level reflecting oxidative tissue injury and with the antioxidative potential: sulfhydryl compounds (-SH) level, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The signs of morphological and biochemical injury to the gastrointestinal tract in animals from group V (treated with BN 52021 and PES) were significantly less expressed than those in groups III and IV. The results suggest an essential role of PAF in oxygen radicals-mediated gastrointestinal injury and a beneficial effect of the early application of BN 52021 in hemorrhagic shock.

elective coronary artery bypass grafting	CABG	BACKGROUND: The purpose of our research was to evaluate the functional recovery and homeostasis of myocardium during simultaneous continuous retrograde and antegrade cardioplegia versus continuous retrograde cardioplegia. METHODS: Forty patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were prospectively assigned to two clinically matched groups and analyzed in respect to cardioplegia protocol. Group I consisted of 24 patients who received continuous retrograde blood cardioplegia; Group II consisted of 16 patients who received simultaneous continuous ante- and retrograde cardioplegia. Hydrogen ion release, carbon dioxide, lactate concentration oxygen content, and oxygen extraction were measured from coronary sinus effluent and from the arterial line before and after cross-clamping of the aorta. Median changes of these parameters were reported. Cardiac output was measured and left and right ventricle stroke works were calculated. Incidence of low cardiac output, ventricular fibrillation, raised cardiac enzymes, and ischemic changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) were noted. RESULTS: In the simultaneous group, oxygen content and oxygen extraction recovered well after cross-clamping. The same parameters did not recover to the same extent in the retrograde group. These changes were notable between groups. Hydrogen ion, carbon dioxide, and lactate releases were comparable between groups. Trend toward better recovery of left ventricle stroke work index was encountered in the simultaneous group. CONCLUSIONS: Viability of myocardium measured with oxygen utilization and functional recovery is better preserved with simultaneous antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia. However, there is no difference in anaerobic metabolism markers. Thus simultaneous ante- and retrograde cardioplegia is probably advantageous over retrograde alone.

oligoclonal IgG bands	OB	Two or more oligoclonal IgG bands (OB) detected by separation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins while not demonstrable in corresponding serum reflect a local B-cell response accompanying central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Using optimized, standardized methodology, preferentially protein separation by isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting, more than 95% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have CSF OB of IgG class not detectable in serum, thereby providing powerful evidence for the diagnosis of MS. Once present, CSF OB persists in the individual patient irrespective of MS course or therapy. Because of the high sensitivity of CSF OB in MS as well as its high specificity in the appropriate clinical setting, examination of CSF for OB of IgG class can be strongly recommended to obtain support for the diagnosis of MS and identify patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) at increased risk of developing MS. The IgG index equal to CSF/serum IgG:CSF/serum albumin is elevated in about 70% of MS patients, but rarely in CSF OB-negative MS. Because of lower diagnostic sensitivity, IgG index cannot be recommended as replacement of CSF OB in the diagnosis of MS but, when elevated, as additional evidence for an augmented B-cell response within the CNS that is compatible with MS. Although the clinical picture as well as findings from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord are essential for an MS diagnosis, this should be re-evaluated in CSF OB-negative patients, keeping in mind the many disease entities imitating MS. Recommended diagnostic criteria for MS must include definitions of the role of lumbar puncture and of clearly specified, optimized and standardized routine CSF investigations including for the presence of CSF IgG OB. There is a need for concerted long-term follow-up studies of the subgroup of MS patients without CSF OB regarding e.g. prognostic and immunologic features. For inclusion in trials of disease-modulating drugs, it is recommended that patients with MS or CIS are selected regarding presence vs. absence of CSF OB. Development and evaluation of new technologies to define local vs. systemic B-cell responses in patients with MS or CIS vs. patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases should shed new light on the role of CSF OB, which remains enigmatic.

phospholipid transfer protein	PLTP	The impact of phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) on HDL metabolism.
High-density lipoproteins	HDL	High-density lipoproteins (HDL) play a major protective role against the development of coronary artery disease. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is a main factor regulating the size and composition of HDL in the circulation and plays an important role in controlling plasma HDL levels. This is achieved via both the phospholipid transfer activity of PLTP and its capability to cause HDL conversion. The present review focuses on the impact of PLTP on HDL metabolism. The basic characteristics and structure of the PLTP protein are described. The two main functions of PLTP, PLTP-mediated phospholipid transfer and HDL conversion are reviewed, and the mechanisms and control, as well as the physiological significance of these processes are discussed. The relationship between PLTP and the related cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is reviewed. Thereafter other functions of PLTP are recapitulated: the ability of PLTP to transfer cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the suggested involvement of PLTP in cellular cholesterol traffic. The discussion on PLTP activity and mass in (patho)physiological settings includes new data on the presence of two forms of PLTP in the circulation, one catalytically active and the other inactive. Finally, future directions for PLTP research are outlined.

malondialdehyde	MDA	In the present study, the reaction mixtures (lead compounds with essential unsaturated fatty acids) were preincubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h prior to the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) by HPLC. The metal-catalyzed reactions were also compared in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a free radical scavenger. Our results showed that according to the difference in the number of double bonds of essential unsaturated fatty acids, the kinds of lead compounds, and the concentrations of lead compounds, the extent of lipid peroxidation was different. The addition of BHT to the reaction mixtures significantly reduced the production of MDA (P < 0.01). These in vitro studies support prior in vivo reports that the important mechanism of the acute toxic effects of the lead compounds is owing at least in part, to metal-catalyzed peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1	PDX1	The nature and identity of the pancreatic beta-cell precursor has remained elusive for many years. One model envisions an early multihormonal precursor that gives rise to both alpha- and beta-cells and the other endocrine cell types. Alternatively, beta-cells have been suggested to arise late, directly from the GLUT2- and pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1)-expressing epithelium, which gives rise also to the acinar cells during this stage. In this study, we have identified a subset of the PDX1+ epithelial cells that are marked by expression of Neurogenin3 (Ngn3). Ngn3, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, is suggested to act upstream of NeuroD in a bHLH cascade. Detailed analysis of Ngn3/paired box factor 6 (PAX6) and NeuroD/PAX6 co-expression shows that the two bHLH factors are expressed in a largely nonoverlapping set of cells, but such analysis also suggests that the NeuroD+ cells arise from cells expressing Ngn3 transiently. NeuroD+ cells do not express Ki-67, a marker of proliferating cells, which shows that these cells are postmitotic. In contrast, Ki-67 is readily detected in Ngn3+ cells. Thus, Ngn3+ cells fulfill the criteria for an endocrine precursor cell. These expression patterns support the notion that both alpha- and beta-cells develop independently from PDX1+/Ngn3+ epithelial cells, rather than from GLU+/INS+ intermediate stages. The earliest sign of alpha-cell development appears to be Brain4 expression, which apparently precedes Islet-1 (ISL1) expression. Based on our expression analysis, we propose a temporal sequence of gene activation and inactivation for developing alpha- and beta-cells beginning with activation of NeuroD expression. Endocrine cells leave the cell cycle before NeuroD activation, but re-enter the cell cycle at perinatal stages. Dynamic expression of Notch1 in PDX+ epithelial cells suggests that Notch signaling could inhibit a Ngn-NeuroD cascade as seen in the nervous system and thus prevent premature differentiation of endocrine cells.

Alternatively, beta-cells have been suggested to arise late, directly from the GLUT2- and pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1)-expressing epithelium, which gives rise also to the acinar cells during this stage. In this study, we have identified a subset of the PDX1+ epithelial cells that are marked by expression of Neurogenin3 (Ngn3). Ngn3, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, is suggested to act upstream of NeuroD in a bHLH cascade. Detailed analysis of Ngn3/paired box factor 6 (PAX6) and NeuroD/PAX6 co-expression shows that the two bHLH factors are expressed in a largely nonoverlapping set of cells, but such analysis also suggests that the NeuroD+ cells arise from cells expressing Ngn3 transiently. NeuroD+ cells do not express Ki-67, a marker of proliferating cells, which shows that these cells are postmitotic. In contrast, Ki-67 is readily detected in Ngn3+ cells. Thus, Ngn3+ cells fulfill the criteria for an endocrine precursor cell. These expression patterns support the notion that both alpha- and beta-cells develop independently from PDX1+/Ngn3+ epithelial cells, rather than from GLU+/INS+ intermediate stages. The earliest sign of alpha-cell development appears to be Brain4 expression, which apparently precedes Islet-1 (ISL1) expression. Based on our expression analysis, we propose a temporal sequence of gene activation and inactivation for developing alpha- and beta-cells beginning with activation of NeuroD expression. Endocrine cells leave the cell cycle before NeuroD activation, but re-enter the cell cycle at perinatal stages. Dynamic expression of Notch1 in PDX+ epithelial cells suggests that Notch signaling could inhibit a Ngn-NeuroD cascade as seen in the nervous system and thus prevent premature differentiation of endocrine cells.

inducible nitric oxide synthase	iNOS	1. There is evidence that the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and peroxynitrite by ischaemia/reperfusion may lead to renal cell injury. Herein, we investigated whether Sheng mai san (SMS), a Chinese herbal medicine, protects against renal ischaemic injury during heat stroke by reducing iNOS-dependent nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite formation. 2. Urethane-anaesthetized rats were exposed to heat stress (ambient temperature 43 degrees C) to induce heat stroke. Control rats were exposed to 24 degrees C. Mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow after the onset of heat stroke were significantly lower in heat stroke rats than in control rats. However, both colonic temperature and renal damage score were greater in heat stroke rats compared with control rats. Similarly, plasma NO, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as the renal immunoreactivity of iNOS and peroxynitrite, were significantly higher in heat stroke rats compared with their normothermic controls. 3. Pretreatment with SMS (1.2 g/day per rat for 7 consecutive days before the initiation of heat stress) significantly attenuated the heat stroke-induced arterial hypotension, hyperthermia, renal ischaemia and damage, the increased renal immunoreactivity of iNOS and peroxynitrite and the increased plasma levels of NO, creatinine and BUN. Pretreatment with SMS resulted in a prolongation of survival time in heat stroke. 4. The results of the present study suggest that SMS protects against renal ischaemic damage by reducing iNOS-dependent NO and peroxynitrite production during heat stroke.

sublingual nitroglycerin	NTG	OBJECTIVES: We set out to determine the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG), as used during routine tilt testing in patients with unexplained syncope, on hemodynamic characteristics and baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). BACKGROUND: Nitroglycerin is used in tilt testing to elicit a vasovagal response. It is known to induce venous dilation and enhance pooling. Also, NTG is lipophilic and readily passes cell membranes, and animal studies suggest a sympatho-inhibitory effect of NTG on circulatory control. METHODS: Routine tilt testing was conducted in 39 patients with suspected vasovagal syncope (age 36 +/- 16 years, 18 females). Patients were otherwise healthy and free of medication. Before a loss of consciousness set in, oncoming syncope was cut short by tilt-back or counter-maneuvers. Finger arterial pressure was monitored continuously (Finapres). Left ventricular stroke volume (SV) was computed from the pressure pulsations (Modelflow). Spontaneous baroreflex control of HR was estimated in the time and frequency domains. RESULTS: During tilt testing, 22 patients developed presyncope. After NTG administration but before presyncope, SV and cardiac output (CO) decreased (p < 0.001), whereas SVR and HR increased (p < 0.001) in all patients. Arterial pressure was initially maintained. Baroreflex sensitivity decreased after NTG. On Cox regression analysis, the occurrence of a vasovagal response was related to a drop in SV after NTG (hazard ratio 0.86, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular response to NTG is similar in vasovagal and non-vasovagal patients, but more pronounced in those with tilt-positive results. The NTG-facilitated presyncope appears to be CO-mediated, and there is no evidence of NTG-induced sympathetic inhibition.

2,6-diaminopurine	DAP	We describe an in vivo mutagenesis model that utilizes reverse mutation and forward mutation at the endogenous Aprt locus. Reverse mutation provides an in situ method for detecting environments or agents that cause point mutations. Forward mutation detects large chromosomal events, including mitotic recombination, chromosome loss, and large multilocus deletion, all of which can lead to loss of heterozygosity. Detection of reverse mutation in vivo is based on the differential capacity of Aprt and Aprt cells to sequester radiolabeled adenine by catalyzing its conversion to adenosine monophosphate with subsequent incorporation into nucleic acids. Cells lacking APRT activity cannot accumulate exogenously administered, tagged adenine, whereas Aprt+ cells can and will thereby become marked. Thus, genetically modified mice with mutant but revertible Aprt alleles should be a useful vehicle for in situ detection of mutagenic activity in the whole animal. the feasibility of this model has been illustrated, first, by showing that APRT-deficient mice are viable and, second, by demonstrating that the minority of Aprt+ cells within a chimeric tumor growing in an Aprt+ mouse can be selectively labeled following IP injection of [14C]-adenine and can be identified by autoradiography. Forward mutation, detected by growth in selective medium of primary cells derived from Aprt+/- heterozygous mice, provides on independent estimate of in vivo mutation frequency. The frequency with which Aprt colonies arise provides a measure of the frequency of Aprt(-)-negative cells in the tissue at that point in time. Culture of skin fibroblasts in 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP) produced Aprt+ colonies with a frequency of about 10(-4). This frequency is similar to that found for human T lymphocytes from individuals heterozygous at the Aprt locus. In both cases, the majority of mutagenic events involved allele loss. Polymerase chain reaction with linked polymorphic microsatellites on mouse chromosome 8 demonstrated that allele loss was mediated mostly by mitotic recombination, as was the case for human T lymphocytes. The high frequency of mitotic recombination and allele loss at a neutral locus has significant implications for the process of tumorigenesis and argues that spontaneous or induced mitotic recombination may play a causal role in the progression to cancer.
D-glucaric acid	D-GA	The antipyrine clearance and the urinary excretion of D-glucaric acid (D-GA) were determined in 122 patients receiving chronic anticonvulsant drug treatment and in 21 drug-free control subjects. Patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (DPH), primidone (PMD) and phenobarbitone (PB), either alone or in combination, showed higher values of antipyrine clearance and excreted larger amounts of D-GA as compared to controls. While antipyrine clearance values did not differ significantly from one drug group to another, D-GA excretion was significantly higher in patients treated with CBZ than in those treated with DPH. In patients treated with sodium valproate antipyrine clearance did not differ from control values. There was a trend for D-GA excretion to be higher in these patients but the difference was not statistically significant. Significant positive correlations were found between the dosage of CBZ, DPH, PMD and PB and both indices of enzyme induction. These data demonstrate a dose-dependent degree of enzyme induction in patients receiving therapeutic doses of these anticonvulsants. The relative potency at average dose levels for antipyrine clearance was PB (1), DPH (0.92), CBZ (0.84), PMD (0.82) and for log D-GA excretion was PB (1), CBZ (0.96), PMD (0.95), DPH (0.90).

juvenile myoclonic epilepsy	JME	A neurophysiologic test battery (consisting of a 24-hour, seven-channel electroencephalogram [EEG], EEG spectral analysis, multiple sleep latency test, visual evoked potentials, critical flicker fusion, and visual contrast sensitivity) was administered twice to 16 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study comparing two daily doses of sodium valproate (VPA), 1000 mg and 2000 mg. Clinical observation time was 6 months for each dose. Mean total VPA concentration during low-dose treatment was 470.4 mmol/L and during high-dose treatment was 700.0 mmol/L. Ten patients had seizures during low-dose treatment, but only three of these showed spike-wave activity on EEGs. During high-dose treatment, nine patients had seizures; five of these had spike-wave activity. EEG power spectrum did not change between doses. The other tests also showed no change between doses. Our results suggested that EEG and our selection of other neurophysiologic tests were of limited value for monitoring seizure frequency and clinical effects of VPA.
sodium valproate	VPA	A neurophysiologic test battery (consisting of a 24-hour, seven-channel electroencephalogram [EEG], EEG spectral analysis, multiple sleep latency test, visual evoked potentials, critical flicker fusion, and visual contrast sensitivity) was administered twice to 16 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study comparing two daily doses of sodium valproate (VPA), 1000 mg and 2000 mg. Clinical observation time was 6 months for each dose. Mean total VPA concentration during low-dose treatment was 470.4 mmol/L and during high-dose treatment was 700.0 mmol/L. Ten patients had seizures during low-dose treatment, but only three of these showed spike-wave activity on EEGs. During high-dose treatment, nine patients had seizures; five of these had spike-wave activity. EEG power spectrum did not change between doses. The other tests also showed no change between doses.

Non-A, non-B	NANB	Non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB), whether following the transfusion of blood products or occurring sporadically without percutaneous exposure, is complicated in approximately 50% of cases by the development of chronic hepatitis. Emerging as a consistent observation is the insidious progression of such cases of chronic NANB hepatitis to cirrhosis. Among patients with chronic NANB hepatitis followed for up to 10 years, cirrhosis is demonstrable in 20%. In May, 1988, the identification of the agent of NANB hepatitis was described by Houghton and colleagues of the Chiron Corporation. Hepatitis C, a 10,000 nucleotide single-stranded RNA virus with properties similar to those of flavivirus, was identified by developing a cDNA library from the genetic material in a chimpanzee inoculum of high infectivity and locating a clone which elaborated a virus-specific protein. Serologic evidence for HCV infection can be detected in 60-90% of cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis and 50% of cases of sporadic NANB hepatitis. Antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) can be detected in 30% of chronic hepatitis B, in 10-46% of alcoholic cirrhosis, in 40-70% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma HBsAg negative and in 0-83% of patients with auto-immune chronic active hepatitis. Assays for HCV antigen will require technology more sensitive such than current immunoassays, such as the polymerase chain reaction. The introduction into blood banks of a screening test for anti-HCV is expected to reduce the risk of transfusion-associated NANB hepatitis and is highly recommended.

diethylcarbamazine	DEC	The effect of ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine (DEC) on Wuchereria bancrofti molting from the third to the fourth larval stage (L3 to L4) was evaluated in vitro. L3 larvae were harvested from laboratory-reared Aedes togoi 2 wk after feeding upon a microfilaremic human volunteer. The larvae were kept in an artificial medium (Franke's NI medium) with 10% human serum under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 20 days. Experimental tubes also contained ivermectin (0.1-1,000 ng/ml) or DEC (0.1-10,000 ng/ml). An estimated concentration of 50 ng/ml ivermectin inhibited molting in 50% of the larvae expected to molt. For DEC, this value was roughly 1,000 ng/ml. In this in vitro culture system, ivermectin inhibited the L3 to L4 molt of W. bancrofti and was roughly 20-fold more potent in this activity than DEC.
control group	C-group	The effect of food deprivation on ova transport, hormonal profiles and metabolic changes was studied in 20 crossbred multiparous sows during their second oestrus after weaning. To determine the time of ovulation, transrectal ultrasonographic examination was performed. The sows were divided into 2 groups, one control group (C-group), which was fed according to Swedish standards, and one experimental group (E-group). The E-group sows were deprived of food from the first morning meal after ovulation until slaughter. Blood samples were collected every second hour from about 12 h before expected ovulation in the second oestrus after weaning until slaughter and were analysed for progesterone, prostaglandin F2 alpha-metabolite, insulin, glucose, free fatty acids and triglycerides. All sows were slaughtered approximately 48 h after ovulation and the genital tract was recovered. The isthmic part of the oviduct was divided into 3 equally long segments and flushed separately with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Uterine horns were also flushed with PBS. A significantly greater number of ova were found in the first and second part of the isthmus in the E-group (p = 0.05) while in the C-group most of the ova were found in the third part of the isthmus or the uterus (p = 0.01). The level of prostaglandin F2 alpha-metabolite was significantly higher in the E-group compared with the C-group. The concentration of progesterone increased in both groups after ovulation but there were no significant differences between the groups. The other blood parameters showed that the food-deprived sows were in a catabolic state. The 48 h period of fasting results, directly or indirectly in an delayed ova transport, which may be due to a delayed relaxation in the smooth circular muscle layer of the isthmus.

new chemical entities	NCEs	Primary cultures of human hepatocytes have been used extensively by both academic and industrial laboratories for evaluating the hepatic disposition of drugs and other xenobiotics. Their primary utility has been for assessing the induction potential of new chemical entities (NCEs) and they continue to serve as the gold standard. Primary considerations for conducting in vitro drug testing utilizing cultures of human hepatocytes, such as the effects of culture and study conditions, are discussed. The maintenance of normal cellular physiology and intercellular contacts in vitro is of particular importance for optimal phenotypic gene expression and response to drugs and other xenobiotics. Significant advances in our understanding of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme regulation have been made with the recent identification of the nuclear receptors mediating the induction of CYP2B and CYP3A enzymes. In particular, the activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) by prototypical inducers of CYP3A has been found to correlate well with the species-specific modulation of CYP3A by various drugs and other xenobiotics. Concomitant with the discovery of PXR has been the identification of compounds that may act synergistically or antagonistically on multiple receptors (e.g., co-repressors and/or co-activators of the receptor) introducing novel mechanisms of drug-drug interactions. Differential expression of the individual isoforms of the major CYP450 enzymes over time in culture suggest that this model system is not reflective of in vivo profiles and, therefore, may be limited in its application for drug metabolism studies. Overall, primary cultures of human hepatocytes can serve as a sensitive and selective model for predicting the regulation of CYP450 modulation by drugs and other xenobiotics. Considerations and recommendations for standardizing testing conditions and choosing relevant endpoint(s) are presented.

percutaneous dilational tracheostomy	PDT	We report 54 patients with critical neurosurgical diseases (16 females, 38 males, age 21-84 years, mean 63.2 years) who were treated with bedside percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) because of respiratory insufficiency due to their cerebral disease. Bronchoscopically guided PDT was performed after stabilisation of the acute stage of neurosurgical disease. In 15 cases, Ciaglia's multiple dilation technique was used, and in 39 patients the dilational forceps technique according to Griggs was performed. In 14 cases (five Ciaglia's method, nine Griggs technique), intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored throughout the procedure. Fifty-two procedures were completed. In two cases, PDT had to be aborted because of inability to puncture the trachea. No death occurred. There was a total complication rate of 16.7%, including the aborted procedures, with 3.7% of the complications classified as severe. No increase in ICP was noted. We conclude that bedside PDT, especially with the Griggs system, is safe and effective if done under bronchoscopic control. With the standard narcotic regimen used in our patients, no increase in ICP occurred.

4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen	TMP	We have used low-level photocrosslinkage to study chromatin effects on psoralen intercalation at specific DNA sequences of various complexities in intact, cultured, Drosophila cells. Alkali-denatured DNA connected in both strands to a 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) interstrand crosslink is insensitive to digestion by the single strand-specific nuclease S1 and does not hybridize to complementary DNA. Crosslink number at any ultraviolet light exposure increases in proportion to the concentration [PS] of TMP dark binding sites that are occupied. The crosslinking constant, K, is the increase in crosslink number per length DNA per increment [PS]. Many factors influence K, including sequence composition and ionic strength. We show here that the ratio of K at any specific sequence (Kh, from hybridization measurements) to Kh at any other specific sequence or to K of total DNA (Kf, from fluorimetry measurements) can be calculated from measurements of crosslinkage, the mass fraction of the sequence in question or of total DNA that is connected in both strands to a crosslink. When crosslinked and uncrosslinked DNAs fragmented by mechanical shear were mixed in known proportions, Kf exceeded Kh of a single-copy gene by 15%. We treated cells with TMP plus near ultraviolet light, then tested for crosslinkage and for hybridization. A single-copy, larval gene at 70D, and a 250-copy type 1 ribosomal DNA intervening sequence, neither of which is transcribed in these cells, were as sensitive to crosslinkage as total, cell DNA. However, single-copy, heat shock gene sequences from loci 63BC and 95D, and the 180-copy ribosomal DNA coding sequence were more sensitive to crosslinkage than total DNA in the same preparations. The excess was largest in the shortest fragments, indicating a localized effect. The same sequences were crosslinked less readily than total DNA in vitro; we calculate a 3.4 to 3.8-fold excess crosslink number in these sequences due to chromatin microenvironment. We tested for effect of transcriptional induction on crosslink sensitivity in the heat shock genes. At low [TMP], heat shock stimulated crosslinkage at or very near heat shock genes in cells, but not in other sequences or in naked DNA. However, overall crosslink sensitivity was unaffected by heat shock. This suggests that transcription increased the affinity of some heat shock gene DNA binding sites for TMP without increasing the number of such sites.
astromicin	ASTM	We investigated in vitro synergistic activity of astromicin (ASTM) combined with beta-lactam antibiotics (cefsulodin (CFS), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftazidime (CAZ), piperacillin (PIPC) and fosfomycin (FOM) against fresh clinical isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which consisted of 13 CFS sensitive (MIC less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) and 19 CFS resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 400 micrograms/ml) strains according to the FIC index. Against CFS-sensitive P. aeruginosa, ASTM showed good synergistic activities when combined with PIPC (54%), CAZ (38%), CPZ (23%) and CFS (8%). Against CFS-resistant P. aeruginosa, ASTM also showed high synergistic activities when combined with CAZ (63%), CPZ (47%), PIPC (37%) and CFS (11%). Among the CFS-resistant P. aeruginosa, one clinical isolate showed a high sensitivity (MIC0.78 micrograms/ml) against ASTM alone.

extravillous trophoblasts	EVTs	The implantation site in 25 pregnant uteri was studied morphologically and immunohistochemically to clarify the developmental process of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). 1. Dense trophoblastic invasion of the decidua was observed. Multinuclear trophoblasts appeared in the deciduo-muscular junction from the 10th week. Trophoblasts infiltrated decidual vessel walls, where extensive perivascular degeneration existed. EVTs may be indispensable for construction of the placenta. 2. In villous trophoblasts (VTs) the location of hCG and hPL was limited to multinuclear cells, whereas in EVTs hCG was present in a few mononuclear cells and hPL was observed in most mononuclear and multinuclear cells. The immunoreactivity of trophoblast-related monoclonal antibodies also differed: neither anti-Tropl (reactive with cytotrophoblasts (CTs)) nor NDOG1 (reactive with syncytiotrophoblasts (STs)) was reactive with EVTs. 3. The absence of hCG and hPL in mononuclear trophoblasts of the cell column indicates that EVTs differentiate after invading the decidua. Kurman et al. proposed the term intermediate trophoblast, indicating cells in transition from CTs to STs and EVTs, and this is based on the concept that the developmental processes of EVTs and VTs are identical. But the results of this study suggested an independent developmental process for EVTs and therefore it seemed that the term intermediate trophoblast should not be employed for EVTs.

transepithelial potential difference	PD	The functional heterogeneity of different segments of the rat large intestine was investigated by means of transepithelial potential difference (PD), short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial resistance (Rt) measurements in control rats and after deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) pretreatment. Rt and PD were low in caecum and proximal colon but higher in the distal colon and rectum. Isc was highest in the distal colon, lower in the caecum, proximal colon, and rectum. None of the electrical properties was sensitive to amiloride in control conditions. DOCA increased PD and Isc in the caecum, distal colon and rectum but had no effect in the proximal colon. The increase of the Isc after DOCA in the distal colon and rectum was reached by induction of the amiloride-sensitive Isc associated with reduction of the amiloride-insensitive Isc. The effect of DOCA could be completely prevented by concurrent spironolactone treatment. The results suggest that the epithelia of the proximal parts of the large intestine are "leaky" whereas those of the distal colon and rectum are relatively "tight". It is concluded that there is a marked quantitative and qualitative segmental heterogeneity along the rat large intestine.
transepithelial resistance	Rt	The functional heterogeneity of different segments of the rat large intestine was investigated by means of transepithelial potential difference (PD), short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial resistance (Rt) measurements in control rats and after deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) pretreatment. Rt and PD were low in caecum and proximal colon but higher in the distal colon and rectum. Isc was highest in the distal colon, lower in the caecum, proximal colon, and rectum. None of the electrical properties was sensitive to amiloride in control conditions. DOCA increased PD and Isc in the caecum, distal colon and rectum but had no effect in the proximal colon. The increase of the Isc after DOCA in the distal colon and rectum was reached by induction of the amiloride-sensitive Isc associated with reduction of the amiloride-insensitive Isc.

type 1 integrase	IN	The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase (IN) forms an oligomer that integrates both ends of the viral DNA. The nature of the active oligomer is unclear. Recombinant IN obtained under reducing conditions is always in the form of noncovalent oligomers. However, disulfide-linked oligomers of IN were recently observed within viral particles. We show that IN produced from a baculovirus expression system can form disulfide-linked oligomers. We investigated which residues are responsible for the disulfide bridges and the relationship between the ability to form covalent dimers and IN activity. Only the mutation of residue C280 was sufficient to prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges in oligomers of recombinant IN. IN activity was studied under and versus nonreducing conditions: the formation of disulfide bridges was not required for the in vitro activities of the enzyme. Moreover, the covalent dimer does not dissociate into individual protomers on disulfide bridge reduction. Instead, IN undergoes a spontaneous multimerization process that yields a homogenous noncovalent tetramer. The C280S mutation also completely abolished the formation of disulfide bonds in the context of the viral particle. Finally, the replication of the mutant virus was investigated in replicating and arrested cells. The infectivity of the virus was not affected by the C280S IN mutation in either dividing or nondividing cells. The disulfide-linked form of the IN oligomers observed in the viral particles is thus not required for viral replication.
total homocysteine	tHcy	Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and serum folate (FA) concentrations were measured in 130 epileptic patients taking anticonvulsant drugs. A significant inverse correlation was found between FA and tHcy. This was greater in the older group (> or = 15 years) than in the younger group (1 to 14 years). There were four FA-deficient patients (FA concentration < 3 ng/mL regardless of symptoms), including three patients in the older group and one in the younger group. All FA-deficient patients had received long-term treatment (> 7 years) with multiple anticonvulsants. Their tHcy levels were higher than the 90th percentile of those in control subjects. Two patients showed extremely high levels of tHcy (57.9 and 29.1 mumol/L) and subnormal plasma methionine levels. After FA therapy, their tHcy decreased to levels the same as or less than those of control subjects and FA increased to above the normal range. Based on these findings, we conclude that measuring FA and tHcy concentrations may be useful for preventing thrombosis due to hyperhomocysteinemia in epileptic patients taking anticonvulsants, particularly those who receive long-term treatment with multiple agents.

isoxazolepropionic acid	AMPA	Ischaemic stroke of the brain accounts for about one third of all deaths in industrialized countries. Many of the patients who survive are severily impaired. Thus, there is an enormous need for pharmacotherapy for the treatment of ischaemic stroke. Why is such a treatment not available yet? Are the pathophysiological sequelae of brain ischaemia not well understood? Have there been no attempts for clinical development of neuroprotective drugs? Everyone who is engaged in stroke research knows that the opposite is true: The cellular processes occuring after brain ischaemia have been studied for a long time, and we have a thorough understanding of the cellular processes which are involved. Many compounds underwent clinical trials, but most of them failed. One hypothesis to explain this disappointing fact might be that the cellular consequences of stroke are manyfold, but that the clinically tested compounds were selective for only one molecular mechanism. The aim of this review is to give a summary of the pathophysiological mechanisms which occur during and after an ischaemic stroke, and to comment on the preclinical studies where multiple disease-related mechanisms were targeted pharmacologically. Moreover, a novel class of neuroprotective compounds, the oxadiazole derivatives, will be presented. Compounds of this chemical class target two key mechanisms which are important for the pathophysiology of stroke, namely voltage-gated sodium channels, as well as glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype.
monoclonal [M] protein,	M	Chronically elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines is a feature of the syndrome known as POEMS (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal [M] protein, skin changes). A patient had a POEMS syndrome with thrombocytosis and biclonal gammopathy and was treated as follows: all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) at 90 mg/day for 50 days, no treatment for 70 days, readministration of tretinoin at 75 mg/day for 180 days. Focal bone lesion irradiation was performed from day 26 to day 50. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and IL-1 beta normalized within 7 days after the first administration of tretinoin, transiently increased at the time of radiotherapy, increased again after withdrawal of the tretinoin, and decreased again after its reintroduction. The platelet count and gammopathy paralleled the changes in the cytokine levels. This study documents in vivo the ability of all-trans-retinoic acid to down-regulate the release of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha, and illustrates its potential as a therapeutic agent in conditions associated with chronic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines.

acute monoblastic leukemia	AML	A patient with acute monoblastic leukemia (AML, M5A) was treated successfully in December 1987. In 1993 after 6 years in complete remission, she presented with an intracutaneous nodular mass on her right upper arm which was resected in toto and shown to be undifferentiated monoblastic leukemia. Two further chloroma lesions were excised in July 1994 and March 1995 respectively. Bone marrow cytology and histology always showed a continuing complete remission with no evidence of leukemia relapse. In July 1995 she presented with a disseminated skin infiltrate and a relapse with 80% monoblasts in the bone marrow. After one course of chemotherapy (Idarubicin/Ara-C), a second complete remission was achieved and her leukemic skin infiltrate disappeared completely. This case illustrates that chloromas of the skin can occur as late as 6 years after treatment for AML and also emphasizes that the occurrence of a chloroma does not necessarily mean immediate leukemia relapse. It also stresses that a second complete remission can be achieved with standard AML-induction therapy despite widespread leukemic skin infiltrates in such patients.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay	ELISA	A review of some applications of the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the serodiagnosis of parasitic infections is presented. Examples are given of applications with trichinellosis, hydatidosis, schistosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, african trypanosomiasis and amoebiasis. ELISA is believed to be a valuable addition to existing serological tools, especially due to its sensitivity and ease of performance.
polyethylene glycol	PEG	The solubility of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) in aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 has been measured at 35 degrees C. Up to 80% w/w PEG the solubility data conform to a log linear equation ln S = ln Sw + f sigma where S is the E2 concentration in the water/cosolvent mixture, Sw is E2 solubility in water, f is the weight fraction of PEG 400 and sigma is a parameter representing the solubilizing power of the cosolvent for the drug. Above 80% PEG the relationship becomes less convincing, with significant deviation from anticipated values. Reasons for these aberrations are discussed. It is suggested that conformational changes may be induced in the PEG by the addition of small quantities of water. Deviations noted for the melting point, viscosity and density data of PEG 400-water solutions may also confirm this suggestion.
streptozocin-induced diabetic	STZ-D	The beneficial effects of L-carnitine administration were studied in vivo in isolated perfused working hearts from control and diabetic rats. Control and streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats were treated daily for 6 wk with high-dose L-carnitine (3 g.kg-1.day-1 i.p.). STZ-D results in loss of body weight and hypoinsulinemia. These effects were not altered by L-carnitine treatment. Myocardial free-carnitine levels were decreased in the untreated diabetic rats. L-Carnitine treatment of the diabetic rats increased myocardial free-carnitine levels, which were comparable with those of control rats. Six weeks after STZ administration, hearts from untreated diabetic animals exhibited depressed left ventricular developed pressure, cardiac contractility, and ventricular relaxation rates compared with control animals. However, this depression was not seen in the L-carnitine-treated diabetic animals. L-Carnitine treatment of diabetic rats significantly reduced plasma glucose and lipid levels but had no effect on control rats. Furthermore, thyroid hormone levels were higher in the L-carnitine-treated diabetic rats than in the untreated diabetic group. The data suggest that high-dose L-carnitine treatment may reduce the severity of diabetes and result in improved cardiac performance.
peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes	PMN	Incubation of chrysotile and amphibole asbestos fibers with normal human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) resulted in a significant stimulation of PMN metabolic activity and generation of toxic oxygen by-products as measured by chemiluminescence (CL). Although all asbestos fibers tested were cytotoxic to PMN, cytotoxicity and CL varied disproportionately with fiber type. Anthophyllite asbestos produced the greatest PMN cytotoxicity. It also depressed PMN phagocytosis of latex beads the most and induced the greatest PMN CL response of the fiber types examined. We postulate that asbestos-induced release of toxic oxygen by-products from PMN which have infiltrated into the pulmonary alveoli may contribute to disease pathogenesis in asbestosis.

Growth hormone releasing factor	GHRF	Growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) was determined by radioimmunoassay in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 37 unmedicated healthy volunteers (mean +/- SD = 23.4 +/- 7.2 pg/ml). A second lumbar puncture in 11 of these subjects suggested that the CSF GHRF levels were stable over time. High performance liquid chromatography revealed that the CSF immunoreactivity co-eluted with the 1-44NH2 and 1-4ONH2 forms of GHRF. Measurements of GHRF in sequential CSF aliquots revealed no evidence of a rostro-caudal gradient, an observation that is compatible with the hypothesis that GHRF has a long half-life in CSF. A significant negative correlation with body weight was found in the 37 subjects. Levels of CSF GHRF were determined in 24 lithium-treated euthymic bipolar patients, 13 of whom provided a second CSF sample during the unmedicated state. No group differences or effects of lithium were noted.

bismuth citrate	RBC	BACKGROUND: Ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based triple therapies for a period of 7 days have proved to be an effective treatment for Helicobacter pylori. AIM: To investigate the eradication efficacy, safety profile and patient compliance of two RBC-based triple therapies given for 5 days. METHODS: Eighty H. pylori-positive patients with dyspeptic symptoms, referred to us for gastroscopy, were consecutively enrolled in this prospective, randomized, open-label study. These patients were randomly assigned to receive a 5-day course of RBC 400 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and either tinidazole 500 mg b.d. (RBCCT group) or amoxycillin 1 g b.d. (RBCCA group). The H. pylori status was assessed by means of histology and rapid urease test at entry, and by 13C-urea breath test 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. RESULTS: All enrolled patients completed the study. Thirty-seven of 40 patients treated with RBCCT (both PP and ITT analysis: 93%; 95% CI: 80-98%) and 35 of 40 in the RBCCA group (both PP and ITT analysis: 88%; 95% CI: 73-96%) returned H. pylori-negative. Slight or mild side-effects occurred in 4/40 patients (10%) in the RBCCT group and in 5/40 (12%) in the RBCCA group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating the efficacy of RBC-based triple therapies given for only 5 days. RBC regimens containing high-dose clarithromycin and either amoxycillin or tinidazole prove to be well tolerated, safe and preserve good eradication rates even when administered for a shorter than conventional duration.
progressive muscle relaxation	PMR	Sixty-six tension headache patients were randomly assigned to one of four conditions for 8 weeks: (a) progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) alone; (b) PMR plus cognitive therapy (PMR + Cog); (c) pseudomeditation, a credible attention-placebo control; or (d) continued headache monitoring. A comparison of overall headache activity (headache index), derived from a daily headache diary, for 4 weeks before treatment to 4 weeks after treatment, revealed that active treatment (PMR and PMR + Cog) was superior to either control condition. Moreover, level of headache medication consumption decreased significantly for the active treatment groups. Although headache-index comparisons of the two active treatments showed no advantage for adding cognitive therapy to PMR, a measure of clinically significant change showed a trend for PMR + Cog to be superior to PMR alone.
Interleukin-6	IL-6	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor components have been shown to be present in rat follicular granulosa cells. The present study was designed to examine the effect of this cytokine on changes in expression of the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) messenger RNA and of the steroidogenic enzyme, CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450 scc) in an in vitro model of granulosa cell maturation. Ovarian granulosa cells harvested from immature rats 2 days after treatment with equine chorionic gonadotropin were cultured for 48 h in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. They were then transferred to a chemically defined serum-free medium and cultured for an additional 72 h. Within 24 h of transfer, the expressions of LHR and CYP11A1 mRNA increased significantly and remained increased for 72 h. The cells responded to exposure to FSH, but not LH, by an increase in production of cAMP before the additional 72 h of culture. The cAMP response to LH was attained within 24 h and persisted for 72 h, whereas the response to FSH decreased continuously with time. Inclusion of IL-6 in the culture medium caused a dose-dependent decrease in expression of LHR mRNA, in addition to a decrease in the cAMP response to LH. Immunoneutralization of endogenous granulosa cell IL-6 resulted in an increase in expression of LHR mRNA, but not CYP11A1 mRNA. The results are consistent with the view that IL-6 may have a physiological role in the maturation of ovarian follicles by modulating the attainment of the LHR in granulosa cells.

diopters	D	PURPOSE: To characterize corneal topography after repair of full-thickness corneal laceration. SETTING: Ophthalmic emergency room serving as a trauma referral center. METHODS: Twenty-two eyes with full-thickness corneal lacerations were prospectively studied after standardized surgical repair. Computerized videokeratography was done 2 and 14 weeks after surgery, with the latter measurement corresponding to 6 to 8 weeks after all sutures were removed. Fellow uninjured eyes served as the control group. RESULTS: Twenty eyes (91%) had a significant reduction in topographic distortion after suture removal. Mean corneal astigmatism, measured by simulated keratometry, was 10.70 diopters (D) +/- 5.90 D (SD) with sutures in place and 2.25 +/- 4.90 D after their removal (P < .005). Eighteen patients (82%) had 2.00 D or less of corneal astigmatism 6 to 8 weeks after all sutures were removed. The final distribution of topographic patterns was bow tie (50%), spherical/oval (36%), and irregular (14%). There was no significant correlation between laceration configuration (curvilinear, jagged, branched wound margins) and final topography. Lacerations that passed within 2.0 mm of the line of sight, however, were significantly more likely to have more than 2.00 D of final astigmatism. Mean central corneal power was 42.40 +/- 3.20 D in the injured eyes and 42.40 +/- 2.40 D in the uninjured fellow eyes. CONCLUSION: Although high astigmatism is frequently produced by corneal sutures used to repair full-thickness lacerations, the cornea has a substantial topographic memory that results in a marked normalization of contour after suture removal.
mitosis-specific activator	MSA	G2/M phase-specific gene transcription in tobacco cells is mediated by R1R2R3-Myb transcriptional activators, NtmybA1 and NtmybA2, which bind to mitosis-specific activator (MSA) elements. We show here that two structurally related genes, MYB3R1 and MYB3R4, which encode homologs of NtmybA1 and NtmybA2, play a partially redundant role in positively regulating cytokinesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutant often fails to complete cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleate cells with gapped walls and cell wall stubs in diverse tissues. These defects correlate with the selective reduction of transcript levels of several G2/M phase-specific genes, which include B2-type cyclin (CYCB2), CDC20.1 and KNOLLE (KN). These genes contain MSA-like motifs in their promoters and were activated by MYB3R4 in transient expression assays in tobacco cells. The KN gene encodes a cytokinesis-specific syntaxin that is essential for cell plate formation. The cytokinesis defects of myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutants were partially rescued by KN gene expression from heterologous promoters. In addition, a kn heterozygous mutation enhanced cytokinesis defects resulting from heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the MYB3R1 and MYB3R4 genes. Our results suggest that a pair of structurally related R1R2R3-Myb transcription factors may positively regulate cytokinesis mainly through transcriptional activation of the KN gene.

low density lipoproteins	LDL	Two diet-derived phenolic acids, caffeic and p-coumaric acids, interplayed with ascorbate in the protection of low density lipoproteins (LDL) from oxidation promoted by ferrylmyoglobin. Ferrylmyoglobin, a two-electron oxidation product from the reaction of metmyoglobin and H2O2, was able to oxidize LDL, degrading free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Upon exposure to ferrylmyoglobin, LDL became rapidly depleted of cholesteryl arachidonate and linoleate, which turn into the corresponding hydroperoxides. Cholesteryl oleate and cholesterol were, comparatively, more resistant to oxidation. Caffeic (2 microM) and p-coumaric (12 microM) acids efficiently delayed oxidations, as reflected by an increase in the lag times required for linoleate hydroperoxide and 7-ketocholesterol formation as well as for cholesteryl linoleate consumption. At the same concentration, ascorbate, a standard water-soluble antioxidant, was less efficient than the phenolic acids. Additionally, phenolic acids afforded a protection to LDL that, conversely to ascorbate, extends along the time, as inferred from the high levels of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate left after 22 hr of oxidation challenging. Significantly, the coincubation of LDL with ascorbate and each of the phenolic acids resulted in a synergistic protection from oxidation. This was inferred from the lag phases of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (the major peroxide found in LDL) formation in the presence of mixtures of ascorbate with phenolic acids longer than the sum of individual lag phases of ascorbate and the phenolic acids. A similar description could be drawn for the accumulation of a late product of oxidation, 7-ketocholesterol. It is concluded that ferrylmyoglobin induces a typical pattern of LDL lipid peroxidation, the oxidation rate of cholesteryl esters being a function of unsaturation; furthermore, there is a synergistic antioxidant activity of diet-derived phenolic acids with ascorbate in the protection of LDL from oxidation, a finding of putative physiological relevance.
muscle-specific tyrosine kinase	MuSK	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the presence of antibodies to a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) has been reported in some patients with seronegative generalized myasthenia gravis. Our objective was to describe a group of patients who were positive for anti-MuSK antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Detection of antibodies using a radioimmunoassay was performed in the serum of 26 patients with generalized myasthenia gravis. We identified 9 patients with anti-MuSK antibodies (MuSK+). Clinical and therapeutic data from these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Eight of nine patients were women aged between 20 and 40 years. Clinically, all of them showed prevalent bulbar signs, initially or during the progression of the disease. 77% of patients showed ocular involvement and 44% had symptoms of fatigability involving limbs. None of them improved upon thymectomy. Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors was variable. All of them responded to immunotherapy, although 30% required polytherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The study of anti-MuSK antibodies defines a subgroup of patients, 34,61% in our series, with seronegative generalized myasthenia. This group is characterized by an homogenous clinical presentation with prevalent bulbar symptoms. The knowledge of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of anti-MuSK antibodies will allow a better understanding of both the variable response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the absence of response to thymectomy in these patients.

We identified 9 patients with anti-MuSK antibodies (MuSK+). Clinical and therapeutic data from these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Eight of nine patients were women aged between 20 and 40 years. Clinically, all of them showed prevalent bulbar signs, initially or during the progression of the disease. 77% of patients showed ocular involvement and 44% had symptoms of fatigability involving limbs. None of them improved upon thymectomy. Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors was variable. All of them responded to immunotherapy, although 30% required polytherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The study of anti-MuSK antibodies defines a subgroup of patients, 34,61% in our series, with seronegative generalized myasthenia. This group is characterized by an homogenous clinical presentation with prevalent bulbar symptoms. The knowledge of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of anti-MuSK antibodies will allow a better understanding of both the variable response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the absence of response to thymectomy in these patients.
CT angiography	CTA	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) for the detectability of 75% and 95% stenoses in phantoms using six different stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six different stents (Expander, Hemobahn, SelfX, Smart, Symphony, and Wallstent) were inserted into tubes filled with contrast agent (ioversol or gadoteric acid). To mimic stenoses of 75% and 95% of the patent lumen, 8-mm-diameter nylon cylinders were bored in the central axis (2 mm and 4 mm, respectively) and placed into the stent lumen. Intensity profiles across stenoses on 2-mm coronal reformatted sections of CTA or MRA were compared, and the detectability of the residual lumen was assessed using a subjective score. RESULTS: CTA showed relative in-stent signal attenuation for the in-stent stenoses of the tested stents ranging from 75% to 100% of the signal intensity of the control. SelfX and Symphony showed further shading of the residual lumen due to beam-hardening artifacts. Overestimation of stenosis was associated with low-grade stenoses in which the border of the lumen was closer to the stent struts. MRA showed relative in-stent signal attenuation of the in-stent stenoses ranging from 30% to 100% of the signal intensity of the control. Strut thickness tended to correlate with higher attenuation at CT. CONCLUSION: CTA may be more suitable for differentiation between 95% stenosis and occlusion; MRA has higher sensitivity in detecting 75% stenoses. Strut thickness and mesh size did not prove to be significant predictors for signal attenuation or overall image quality.

Acute retinal necrosis	ARN	Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a rare entity caused by Herpes viruses. An immunocompromised background and the complications of ARN mostly lead to a poor visual outcome. Confirmation of the early diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and antibody detection from aqueous or vitreous taps is recommended to improve the medical management and prevent disease progression with an increased risk of complications. Favourable outcomes are possible by means of combined antiviral systemic and intravitreal strategies with Acyclovir, Foscarnet and Ganciclovir. We report on the relevant literature recommendations and our own experience.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion	CSII	Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy using external infusion pumps provides an alternative to multiple daily injections (MDI) for insulin-dependent diabetics who require intensive insulin therapy. CSII allows for the delivery of regular insulin continuously at preset basal rates and at bolus doses, which can be varied in response to insulin needs of the patient. Intensive insulin therapy by CSII or MDI was administered to diabetics to improve control of their blood glucose levels and to assess its effects on the development of complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. CSII appeared to be as effective as MDI in attaining near-normoglycemia and improving metabolic control in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who required intensive insulin therapy. It was not clear, however, whether the improved control of the blood glucose levels resulted in the prevention or progression of the diabetic complications. The risks of having adverse effects, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia, were higher with CSII as compared with MDI; both methods having higher risks of these complications in comparison to conventional insulin therapy. CSII may be beneficial for patients requiring intensive insulin therapy who may need greater lifestyle flexibility with regard to meal timing, work, and recreational scheduling.

deoxyribonuleic acid	DNA	The role of endogenous regucalcin in the regulation of deoxyribonuleic acid (DNA) synthesis in the nuclei of the cloned rat hepatoma cells (H4-II-E) with proliferative cells was investigated. Cells were cultured for 6-96 h in a alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing fetal bovine serum (FBS; 1 or 10%). Cell number was significantly increased between 24 and 96 h after culture with 10% FBS; cell proliferation was markedly stimulated by culture with 10% FBS as compared with that of 1% FBS. In vitro DNA synthesis activity in the nuclei of cells was significantly elevated 6 h after culture with 10% FBS and its elevation was remarkable at 12 and 24 h after the culture. Nuclear DNA synthesis activity was significantly reduced in the presence of various protein kinase inhibitors (PD98059, staurosprine, or trifluoperazine) in the reaction mixture containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 12 and 24 h with FBS (1 and 10%). The addition of regucalcin (10(-7) and 10(-6)M) in the reaction mixture caused a significant inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis activity. The presence of anti-regucalcin monoclonal antibody (25-100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS resulted in a significant increase in nuclear DNA synthesis activity. This increase was completely blocked by the addition of regucalcin (10(-6) M). The effect of anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in increasing nuclear DNA synthesis activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of various protein kinase inhibitors. DNA synthesis activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS in the presence of Bay K 8644 (2.5 x 10(-6) M). Culture with Bay K 8644 did not cause a significant increase in DNA synthesis activity in the absence of anti-regucalcin antibody. The present study demonstrates that endogenous regucalcin plays a suppressive role in the enhancement of nuclear DNA synthesis with proliferative cells.

Crossed line immunoelectrophoresis	CLIE	Crossed line immunoelectrophoresis (CLIE) was used to show that a minor allergen present in birch pollen and another present in timothy pollen shared common epitopes with antigens in apple, carrot and celery tuber. Major pollen allergens were not involved. Structural similarities were also noticed in some mugwort pollen antigens and antigens in apple, carrot and celery, but none of these mugwort antigens acted as an allergen. In crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) of samples of apple, carrot or celery extracts towards antibodies against birch pollen, grass pollen or mugwort pollen, four to 14 distinct precipitates were observed and shown to be specific. In crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) none of the precipitates could be shown to act as an allergen. Using allergen detection on nitrocellulose paper, the apple, carrot and celery extracts were shown to possess IgE-binding capacity.

Shine-Dalgarno	SD	Transcription of the Bacillus thuringiensis cryIIIA toxin gene is initiated at nucleotide position -558 (relative to the cryIIIA start codon). However, the major cryIIIA transcript is an mRNA with its 5' end at nucleotide position -129. Fusions to the lacZ reporter gene revealed that the cryIIIA 5' untranslated region downstream of nucleotide position -129 acts as a 5' mRNA stabilizer. Deletion and mutation analysis suggest that the determinant of stability is a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence close to the 5' end of the stable transcript. This SD sequence, designated STAB-SD, does not direct translation initiation. However, mutations predicted to weaken the putative interaction between the SD sequence and the 3' end of 16S rRNA lead to reduced mRNA stability. The binding of a 30S subunit to STAB-SD may be required for stabilization of cryIIIA mRNA as a transcript with a 5' end at nucleotide position -129. Similar STAB-SD sequences are found in the 5' untranslated regions of other cryIII genes, and in the 5' untranslated regions of genes from Gram-positive bacteria other than B. thuringiensis and may therefore be a widespread determinant of mRNA stability.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	RdRp	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity has been detected in mitochondria from an isolate of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi infected with O. novo-ulmi mitovirus 6 (OnuMV6). The reaction products corresponded to the double-stranded and single-stranded forms of OnuMV6 RNA. Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against a conserved RdRp region has detected a protein of ca. 80 kDa in OnuMV6-infected mitochondria, close to the predicted size of the OnuMV6 RdRp. No RdRp activity or protein was detected in mitochondria from an uninfected O. novo-ulmi isolate. This is the first detection of a virus RdRp in fungal mitochondria and the results are consistent with the use of UGA tryptophan codons in its synthesis.

succinyl-CoA synthetase	SCS	We have identified and characterized a structurally novel succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Thermococcus kodakaraensis. The presence of an SCS completes the metabolic pathway from glutamate to succinate in Thermococcales, which had not been clarified because of the absence of classical SCS homologs on their genomes. The SCS from T. kodakaraensis (SCS(Tk)) is a heteromeric enzyme (alpha(2)beta(2)) encoded by TK1880 (alpha-subunit) and TK0943 (beta-subunit). Although both SCS(Tk) and classical SCSs harbor the five domains present in enzymes of the acyl-CoA synthetase (nucleoside diphosphate-forming) superfamily, the domain order and distribution among subunits in SCS(Tk) (alpha-subunit, domains 1-2-5; beta-subunit, domains 3-4) are distinct from those of classical SCSs (alpha-subunit, domains 1-2; beta-subunit, domains 3-4-5) and instead resemble the acetyl-CoA synthetases from Pyrococcus furiosus (ACSs I(Pf) and II(Pf)). Comparison of the four Thermococcales genomes revealed that each strain harbors five alpha- and two beta-subunit homologs. Sequence similarity suggests that the beta-subunit of SCS(Tk) is also a component of the presumed ACS II from T. kodakaraensis (ACS II(Tk)). We coexpressed the alpha/beta-genes of SCS(Tk) (TK1880/TK0943) and of ACS II(Tk) (TK0139/TK0943). ACS II(Tk) recognizes a broad range of hydrophobic/aromatic acid compounds, as is the case with ACS II(Pf), whereas SCS(Tk) displays a distinct and relatively strict substrate specificity for several acids, including succinate. This indicates that the alpha-subunits are responsible for the distinct substrate specificities of SCS(Tk) and ACS II(Tk).

creatine kinase	CK	Total creatine kinase (CK) and CK-B activity in maternal blood and cord-blood samples after vaginal and cesarean births.
creatine kinase	CK	We studied variations in the activity of total creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) and of CK-B in maternal and cord-blood samples, comparing data obtained for vaginal and cesarean births. CK-B activity was determined with an immunoinhibition assay. In all cases, there was a significant postpartum increase in total CK and in CK-B activity in maternal sera, whereas cord-blood samples showed no significant differences between activities in arterial and venous blood for either vaginal or cesarean births. Statistically significant differences were found in CK-B activity, but not in total CK, between cord-blood samples from vaginal births and those from cesareans.
Mac-1-regulated forkhead	MFH	The precise signals responsible for differentiation of blood-borne monocytes into tissue macrophages are incompletely defined. "Outside-in" signaling by integrins has been implicated in modulation of gene expression that affects cellular differentiation. Herein, using differential display PCR, we have cloned an 85-kDa forkhead transcription factor (termed Mac-1-regulated forkhead [MFH] and found subsequently to be identical to Foxp1) that is downregulated in beta(2)-integrin Mac-1-clustered compared with Mac-1-nonclustered monocytic THP-1 cells. MFH/Foxp1 is expressed in untreated HL60 cells, and its expression was markedly reduced during phorbol ester-induced monocyte differentiation, but not retinoic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation. Overexpression of MFH/Foxp1 markedly attenuated phorbol ester-induced expression of c-fms, which encodes the M-CSF receptor and is obligatory for macrophage differentiation. This was accompanied by decreased CD11b expression, cell adhesiveness, and phagocytosis. Using electromobility shift and reporter assays, we have established that MFH/Foxp1 binds to previously uncharacterized sites within the c-fms promoter and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Deficiency of Mac-1 is associated with altered regulation of MFH/Foxp1 and monocyte maturation in vivo. Taken together, these observations suggest that Mac-1 engagement orchestrates monocyte-differentiation signals by regulating the expression of the forkhead transcription repressor MFH/Foxp1. This represents a new pathway for integrin-dependent modulation of gene expression and control of cellular differentiation.
immunodeficiency virus	HIV	BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection results in a selective CD4+ T cell depletion and an impairment of T cell regulation. Despite the immune depletion, the progression of HIV infection is accompanied by the stimulation of antibody synthesis. Thus, the prevalence and amplitude of the increase of total serum IgE level and the relationship between the IgE levels and the degree of immunodeficiency were evaluated in patients with HIV infection. METHOD: Twenty-six Korean adults infected with HIV, in different stages, were evaluated for serum IgE level and CD4+ T cell count. Serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels were also determined. All subjects enrolled in this study denied an individual and familial history of atopic diseases. The possibility of parasitic infestation was also excluded by history and stool examination. RESULTS: The mean serum IgE level was 473.5 IU/L with a standard deviation of 671.4 IU/L (range: 15.9-2000 IU/L) and increased serum IgE levels (> 200 IU/L) were found in 38.5% of the study population. The mean serum IgG, IgA and IgM levels were 1,939.5 +/- 588.6 mg/dL (normal: 751-1,560 mg/dL), 388.9 +/- 216.7 mg/dL (normal: 82-453 mg/dL) and 153.6 +/- 75.3 mg/dL (normal: 46-304 mg/dL), respectively. The CD4+ T cell count was inversely correlated to the serum IgE level (r = -0.429, p < 0.05), but not to the other isotypes of immunoglobulin. CONCLUSION: Serum IgE levels are increased in adults with HIV infection and could be useful as a marker of disease progression. Further study is needed to elucidate the causes and clinical significance of these findings.
basic helix-loop-helix	bHLH	The SCL gene (also called Tal-1 or TCL5) was identified because of its association with chromosomal translocations in childhood T-cell lymphoid leukemias. SCL codes for a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor. In the adult, SCL expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells and tissues, but its function in the process of lineage commitment is unknown. The present study was designed to address the role of SCL in hematopoietic cell differentiation. SCL expression was determined in primary hematopoietic cells through the screening of cDNA samples obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from single cells at different stages of differentiation. SCL RNA expression was highest in bipotential and committed erythroid precursors and diminished with subsequent maturation to proerythroblasts and normoblasts. In contrast, SCL mRNA was low to undetectable in precursors of granulocytes and monocytes and their maturing progeny. The same pattern of expression was observed after erythroid or monocytic differentiation of a bipotent cell line, TF-1, in that SCL mRNA levels remained elevated during erythroid differentiation and were downregulated with monocytic differentiation. Accordingly, TF-1 was chosen as a model to investigate the functional significance of this divergent pattern of SCL expression in the two lineages. Four independent clones stably transfected with an SCL expression vector exhibited enhanced spontaneous and delta-aminolevulinic acid-induced erythroid differentiation as measured by glycophorin expression and hemoglobinization, consistent with the view that SCL is a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, constitutive SCL expression interfered with monocytic differentiation, as assessed by the generation of adherent cells and the expression of Fc gamma RII in response to TPA. These results suggest that the downregulation of SCL may be required for monocytic differentiation.

Schistosoma japonicum	Sj	OBJECTIVE: To study the protective immunity against Schistosoma japonicum (Sj) cercariae challenge in mice immunized with FhGST or AsGST. METHODS: There groups of Kunming mice were immunized three times with rSjGST, FhGST and AsGST, respectively. Then 30 cercariae of Schistosoma japonicum were given per mouse by abdominal skin inoculation. Six weeks later, all mice were killed to collect adult worms, liver, spleen and large intestine for worm count and egg count. RESULTS: The worm burden was reduced by 27.8%-36.4% in the three immune groups compared with the two control groups (P < 0.05). rSj26GST, FhGST and AsGST significantly decreased the number of eggs deposited in the tissues. CONCLUSION: FhGST and AsGST could induce protection against S. japonicum cercariae infection.
monozygotic	MZ	Analysis of the presence of psoriasis in all first-degree relatives of psoriatic twin probands, 38 monozygotic (MZ) and 24 dizygotic (DZ), has been performed in order to clarify if genetic heterogeneity might be present (the twin-family method). The probands were derived from a population based sample of like-sexed twin pairs. An almost identical frequency of psoriasis in parents, siblings and children, with no sex difference, was found. By comparisons of empirical risk figures for psoriasis in first-degree relatives of concordant as compared with discordant MZ probands and HLA-B 13 and/or HLA-B 17 positive MZ probands compared with MZ probands lacking these antigens, no clue to the presence of genetic heterogeneity was found. An almost identical risk in co-twins and ordinary siblings of DZ-probands was found. The data were incompatible with autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but not incompatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance or with multifactorial inheritance.

isoleucine zipper	IZ	AIM: To clone and express the recombinant human soluble CD40 ligand(CD40L) with biological activation. METHODS: The isoleucine zipper (IZ) gene was fused at N-terminal of CD40L gene coding E107-L261 contributing to form trimer. The gene coding hexahistidine was fused at the N-terminal of IZ because the sCD40L-IZ fusion protein could be purified by affinity chromatography. Then the fusion gene was amplified and cloned into expression plasmid pET30a. RESULTS: The protein sCD40L-IZ with His-tag at the N-terminal was effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies and a denaturation and refolding procedure was performed to acquire soluble sCD40L-IZ. The fusion protein sCD40L-IZ was conveniently purified using HiTrap affinity column with above 95% purity. The gel filtration chromatography and non-reduced SDS-PAGE identified the trimeric structure of the recombinant protein. The microscope analysis showed the sCD40L-IZ interacted with the membrane CD40 on XG2, a multiple myeloma cell line. CONCLUSION: The recombinant human trimeric CD40L-IZ was expressed in prokaryotic cells successfully, which has provided a basis for further study of the relationship between CD40L and apoptosis, CD40L and pathogenesis of illness. It is also useful to clinical treatment.
NTERA-2 cl.D1	NT2/D1	Monoclonal antibodies were used in indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot studies to examine the expression of four different classes of intermediate filaments, namely, neurofilaments, glial filaments, cytokeratin, and vimentin, in NTERA-2 cl.D1 (NT2/D1) pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, and in the neurons derived from these cells by differentiation induced with retinoic acid. In the EC cell cultures, grown in the absence of retinoic acid, cytokeratin was the predominant intermediate filament detected by immunofluorescence; only a few cells expressed vimentin, and none expressed glial filament protein or any of the three neurofilament proteins (NF195, NF170, and NF70). Immunoblot analyses of cytoskeletal extracts of these cells supported these data. Two days after exposure to retinoic acid, all three neurofilament subunits were detected in a few cells with a non-neuronal morphology and, by double indirect immunofluorescence, were observed to colocalize with cytokeratin. The number of neurofilament-positive cells increased with time after initial exposure to retinoic acid, and although 95% of these cells contained cytokeratin initially, less than 5% of the neurofilament-positive cells retained cytokeratin 2 weeks later. By this time, many of the cells expressing all three neurofilaments but no cytokeratin exhibited a neuronal morphology. Vimentin was evident in a large number of cells in the cultures, but it was not detected in the neurofilament-positive cells. Also, many of the neurofilament-negative cells continued to express cytokeratin. No cells expressing glial filament proteins were found. Immunoblot analysis of the differentiated cultures also revealed all three neurofilament subunits, and vimentin and cytokeratin, but no glial filament protein. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity	SLI	Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) has been demonstrated by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in rat serum using an antiserum specific for somatostatin and cross-reacting maximally with the biologically important area on the peptide. The RIA has a sensitivity of 35 pg/ml. SLI dilutes in parallel with synthetic somatostatin standard in the RIA and shows characteristics similar to synthetic somatostatin on Sephadex G-25 (f) gel chromatography eluting largely as a single peak with 1 M acetic acid. Significant regional differences in serum SLI are present. A positive gradient was found in paired samples from aorta (mean+/-SEM, 0.304+/-0.024 ng/ml) and portal vein (0.495+/-0.047 ng/ml) consistent with the known presence of somatostatin in gut and pancreas, and a negative gradient was noted between paired samples from portal vein (0.523+/-0.076 ng/ml) and hepatic vein (0.290+/-0.048 ng/ml) indicating hepatic clearance. No significant differences were demonstrated between aorta and confluence of cerebral venous sinuses or between aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC). After intragastric glucose, a significant and marked elevation of portal SLI was observed, maximal at 5 min (0.416+/-0.137 vs. 1.55+/-0.30 ng/ml at 5 min). A significant biphasic elevation of portal SLI also occurred after intravenous glucose. After both routes of glucose administration, the patterns of portal SLI followed closely those of portal glucose and insulin. By contrast, IVC SLI failed to reflect these changes. Thus, SLI in the rat shows chromatographic similarity with synthetic somatostatin. Regional differences in serum levels are marked; the highest concentrations being found in the portal venous effluent of pancreas and gut. Furthermore, glucose causes elevation of portal SLI in a pattern similar to portal insulin and glucose and without concomitant elevation in IVC. This differential elevation of SLI after glucose is consistent with a hormonal action within the portal system as a direct effect of somatostatin on the liver has previously been demonstrated. In addition, the liver is important in the clearance of portal SLI, possibly to prevent extraportal effects in response to gut and pancreatic stimulation. Finally, it is clear that regional sampling of serum for SLI measurement may be critical in the investigation of the putative physiological roles for somatostatin.

ventricular tachyarrhythmia	VT	Death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) remains an important public health problem; patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) constitute the largest identifiable population for prophylactic interventions. Targeting of progressively higher-risk subgroups of post-MI survivors carries inevitable tradeoffs with respect to the global impact of interventions on overall mortality. Therapy with aspirin, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors comprise the benchmark against which all additional interventions, including implantable defibrillators, must be measured. Initial enthusiasm for empiric amiodarone therapy has been tempered by the limited benefit demonstrated in recent randomized trials. Trials of other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, including both d,l-sotalol and d-sotalol, have also failed to demonstrate survival benefit. The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) demonstrated significantly improved survival associated with defibrillators in a small subgroup of post-MI survivors with a high short-term risk of death. The ultimate number and optimal criteria for selection of patients who may benefit from prophylactic defibrillator therapy after MI will undergo continued evolution as new data from current and ongoing trials become available.

acute anterior uveitis	AAU	Serum levels of immunoglobulin A, G, and M were examined in 99 patients with acute anterior uveitis (AAU). The mean level of serum IgA was raised (p less than 0.001) in AAU patients when compared with healthy control subjects. The levels of serum IgG and IgM were not significantly different from those in the control group. The raised levels of serum IgA were found to occur predominantly in the HLA-B27 positive group of patients (p less than 0.001) and were highest in HLA-B27 positive patients with sacroiliitis or associated spondylarthritic diseases (p less than 0.001). The HLA-B27 negative group of AAU patients did not have a significantly raised mean serum IgA. The raised level of serum IgA in HLA-B27 positive AAU patients suggests that there has been a response to an environmental or infectious agent(s) acting across a mucosal tissue in these patients. This agent could be responsible for the initiation of the acute ocular inflammation.
cyclooctadiene	cod	The use of diolefin-containing rhodium precatalysts leads to induction periods in asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral olefins. Consequently, the reaction rate increases in the beginning. The induction period is caused by the fact that some of the catalyst is blocked by the diolefin and thus not available for hydrogenation of the prochiral olefin. Therefore, the maximum reaction rate cannot be reached initially. Due to the relatively slow hydrogenation of cyclooctadiene (cod) the share of active catalysts increases at first, and this leads to typical induction periods. The aim of this work is to quantify the hydrogenation of the diolefins cyclooctadiene (cod) and norborna-2,5-diene (nbd) for cationic complexes of the type [Rh(ligand)(diolefin)]BF(4) for the ligands Binap (1,1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diylbis(phenylphosphine)), Me-Duphos (1,2-bis(2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene, and Catasium in the solvents methanol, THF, and propylene carbonate. Furthermore, an approach is presented to determine the desired rate constant and the resulting respective pre-hydrogenation time from stoichiometric hydrogenations of the diolefin complexes via UV/Vis spectroscopy. This method is especially useful for very slow diolefin hydrogenations (e.g., cod hydrogenation with the ligands Me-Duphos, Et-Duphos (1,2-bis(2,5-diethylphospholano)benzene), and dppe (1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane).

reversible round-off linear transformation	RROLT	Error propagation and word-length-growth are two intrinsic effects influencing the performance of wavelet-based ECG data compression methods. To overcome these influences, a non-recursive 1-D discrete periodized wavelet transform (1-D NRDPWT) and a reversible round-off linear transformation (RROLT) theorem are developed. The 1-D NRDPWT can resist truncation error propagation in decomposition processes. By suppressing the word- length-growth effect, RROLT theorem enables the 1-D NRDPWT process to obtain reversible octave coefficients with minimum dynamic range (MDR). A non-linear quantization algorithm with high compression ratio (CR) is also developed. This algorithm supplies high and low octave coefficients with small and large decimal quantization scales, respectively. Evaluation is based on the percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) performance measure, the maximum amplitude error (MAE), and visual inspection of the reconstructed signals. By using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the experimental results show that this new approach can obtain a superior compression performance, particularly in high CR situations.

anti-I-Ak antibody	AB	A single injection of anti-I-Ak antibody (AB) into H-2k mice resulted in abrogation of splenic antigen-presenting cell (APC) function for protein antigen-primed T cells or alloantigen-specific T cells. Spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated mice are not inhibitory in cell mixing experiments when using cloned antigen-specific T cells as indicator cells, thus excluding a role for suppressor cells in the observed defect. Also, nonspecific toxic effects and carry-over of blocking Ab were excluded as causes for the defect. Experiments with anti-I-Ak Ab in (H-2b X H-2k)F1 mice showed abrogation of APC function for T cells specific for both parental I-A haplotypes. In homozygous H-2k mice, anti-I-Ak treatment not only abrogated APC function for I-Ak-restricted cloned T cells but also for I-AekE alpha k-restricted cloned T cells. FACS analysis of spleen cells from anti-I-Ak-treated (H-2b X H-2k)F1 mice revealed the disappearance of all Ia antigens (both I-A and I-E determined), whereas the number of IgM-bearing cells was unaffected. The reappearance of APC function with time after injection was correlated with the reappearance of I-A and I-E antigen expression. In vitro incubation of spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated mice led to the reappearance of Ia antigen expression and APC function within 8 hr. Thus, it appears that B cells (as determined by FACS analysis) and APC (as determined by functional analysis) behave similarly in response to in vivo anti-I-A Ab treatment. We interpret these findings as suggesting that in vivo anti-I-A treatment temporarily reduces the expression of Ia molecules through co-modulation on all Ia-bearing spleen cells, thereby rendering them incompetent as APC. Such modulation of Ia molecules does not occur when spleen cells are incubated in vitro with anti-I-A antibodies. These results imply that a primary defect purely at the level of APC in anti-I-A-treated mice may be responsible for the observed T cell nonresponsiveness when such mice are subsequently primed with antigen.

In vitro incubation of spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated mice led to the reappearance of Ia antigen expression and APC function within 8 hr. Thus, it appears that B cells (as determined by FACS analysis) and APC (as determined by functional analysis) behave similarly in response to in vivo anti-I-A Ab treatment. We interpret these findings as suggesting that in vivo anti-I-A treatment temporarily reduces the expression of Ia molecules through co-modulation on all Ia-bearing spleen cells, thereby rendering them incompetent as APC. Such modulation of Ia molecules does not occur when spleen cells are incubated in vitro with anti-I-A antibodies. These results imply that a primary defect purely at the level of APC in anti-I-A-treated mice may be responsible for the observed T cell nonresponsiveness when such mice are subsequently primed with antigen.
Bangladesh Integrated Nutritional Program	BINP	The impact of food supplementation on infant weight gain in rural Bangladesh; an assessment of the Bangladesh Integrated Nutritional Program (BINP).
Bangladesh Integrated Nutritional Program	BINP	OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficiency of the Bangladesh Integrated Nutritional Program (BINP) in identifying which infants should be supplemented, whether full supplementation was given for the stipulated period of time, and whether the correct exit criteria from the supplementation programme were used. To test whether targeted food supplementation of infants between 6-12 months of age resulted in enhanced weight gain. SETTING: Mallickbari Union, Bhaluka, a rural area located about 100 km north of Dhaka, Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and twenty-six infants followed for 6 to 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 526 infants studied, 368 should have received supplementation based on BINP criteria but only 111 infants (30%) did so, while a further 13% were incorrectly given supplementation. So in total over half (52.8%) of the sample was incorrectly identified for supplementation. In addition, less than a quarter of the infants received the full 90 days of supplementation and close to half of the infants exited the programme without the requisite weight gain. Infants were assigned to one of four groups: correctly supplemented, correctly non-supplemented, incorrectly supplemented or incorrectly non-supplemented. This classification provided natural controls; the correctly supplemented infants versus the incorrectly non-supplemented infants, and the correctly non-supplemented infants versus the incorrectly supplemented infants. There were no significant differences in weight gain between the correctly supplemented group and the incorrectly non-supplemented group or between the correctly non-supplemented and the incorrectly supplemented groups, nor was there any evidence of growth faltering in the incorrectly non-supplemented group. CONCLUSIONS: This study found serious programmatic deficiencies - inability to identify growth faltering in infants, failure to supplement for the full time period and incorrect exit procedures. There was no evidence that food supplementation had any impact on improving infant weight gain.
disease modifying antirheumatic drugs	DMARD	As effective antiinflammatory agents have been added to our armamentarium, 2 major treatment strategies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis have developed. The traditional pyramid strategy is based on initial, conservative measures, followed by more aggressive therapy as the disease progresses. The step-down bridge approach is an alternative, more aggressive strategy that favors earlier use of more potent agents. The longterm effects of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and combination second line therapy on disease progression remain unclear. Advances in the development of more specific DMARD and in human recombinant proteins offer promising future therapies.
Cytochrome P450	CYP	Cytochrome P450 (CYP) involved in the two major pathways of imipramine (IMI) was reappraised using human liver microsomes phenotyped for S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation in vitro and 11 recombinant human CYP isoforms. Individual Eadie-Hoffstee plots for IMI N-demethylation and 2-hydroxylation showed a monophasic profile in microsomes obtained from three putative S-mephenytoin poor metabolizer (PM) livers, whereas the plots gave a biphasic relationship (except for one case in 2-hydroxylation) in those from the three extensive metabolizer (EM) livers. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitor/substrate probes on the two metabolic reactions were examined at the two IMI concentrations (2 and 400 microM) with microsomes obtained from the two PM and three EM livers. S-mephenytoin inhibited IMI N-demethylation by 50% at the low concentration in microsomes from the EM livers with no discernible effect on this pathway in those from the PM livers. Furafylline inhibited the N-demethylation by about 60% at the low and high substrate concentrations in microsomes from both the EM and PM livers. Quinidine abolished the 2-hydroxylation at the low and high concentrations in microsomes from both the EM and the PM livers. Among the recombinant human CYPs, CYP2C19, 2C18, 2D6, 1A2, 3A4 and 2B6 in rank order catalyzed the N-demethylation, whereas CYP2D6, 2C19, 1A2, 2C18 and 3A4 catalyzed the 2-hydroxylation. The Km values obtained from recombinant CYP2C19 and 1A2 approximated those of the high- and low-affinity components from human liver microsomes for IMI N-demethylation, respectively. For IMI 2-hydroxylation, the respective Km values obtained from recombinant CYP2D6 and 2C19 were close to those of the high- and low-affinity components from human liver microsomes. Our human liver microsomal study using the near-therapeutic IMI concentration (2 microM) suggests that 1) CYP2C19 and 1A2 are involved in the N-demethylation and the 2-hydroxylation is mediated exclusively by CYP2D6 and partially by CYP2C19 in the EM livers, and 2) CYP1A2 and 2D6 play a major role in IMI N-demethylation and 2-hydroxylation, respectively, in the PM livers. Our recombinant human CYP isoform study, in general, supports this conclusion.

atrioventricular	AV	To investigate mechanisms of ventricular impulse formation in response to sympathetic stimulation in the healthy canine heart in situ, we compared the patterns of ventricular activation during the idioventricular rhythms arising after complete atrioventricular (AV) block and ventricular tachycardias induced by RSG or LSG stimulation. Isochronal maps were generated by computer from 116-127 unipolar electrograms recorded from the entire ventricular epicardium in 15 open chest, anesthetized dogs. In eight of these, bipolar electrograms were recorded with plunge electrodes from 11 selected endocardial sites located below epicardial breakthrough areas. Intracardiac recordings from the His-Purkinje system were made with electrode catheters. After electrograms were recorded during sinus rhythm, complete AV block was induced by injecting formaldehyde into the AV node and idioventricular rhythms occurred spontaneously at a rate of 37 +/- 12 beats/min (mean +/- SD, n = 25). During idioventricular rhythms, endocardial activation preceded the earliest epicardial breakthrough, which occurred in either the right anterior paraseptal region, antero-apical left ventricle, or postero-apical left ventricle. These sites were consistent with a focal origin in the subendocardial His-Purkinje system. Total epicardial activation times lasted for 47 +/- 13 msec (n = 40). Idioventricular rhythms were suppressed by overdrive pacing (intermittent trains of ten beats with decremental cycle length from 500 to 200 msec) or by intravenous calcium infusion (to plasma levels of 10.1-15.2 mM). Right or left stellate ganglion stimulation increased idioventricular rhythm rates (to 52 +/- 13 beats/min, n = 28) and also induced, in all preparations, ventricular tachycardias that had significantly faster rates (189 +/- 55 beats/min, n = 27, P less than 0.005). Ventricular fibrillation was induced after brief runs of ventricular tachycardia in five of the preparations. During ventricular tachycardias, epicardial activation occurred on the right ventricular outflow tract or the postero-lateral wall of the left ventricle, and preceded endocardial activation in 50% of cases. Total epicardial activation times (103 +/- 29 beats/min) were significantly longer than during idioventricular rhythms (P less than 0.005). Ventricular tachycardias displayed overdrive excitation at critical pacing cycle lengths (360-280 msec) and were not suppressed by calcium infusion. Thus, differential mechanisms of impulse formation with distinct localizations can be elicited from healthy ventricular myocardium.
diazepam	DAP	This article reports a highly sensitive method specific for determination of clozapine(CLP) and its N-demethylated metabolite (DCLP) in serum by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. A 0.5 mL serum was alkalized with 0.5 mL 1.0 mol/L sodium hydroxide and was extracted with 5 mL ether, then the organic phase was transferred to another tube containing 1 mL 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid. After being shaken and centrifuged, the organic phase was discarded, and 10 microL 100 micrograms/L diazepam (DAP) was added to the water phase as internal standard, then 0.5 mL 1.0 mol/L sodium hydroxide and 5 mL ether were added. The extract was evaporated to dryness and then was acylated with 50 microL trifluoroacetic anhydride under 50 degrees C for 45 min. The excess of the reagent was evaporated and the residue was disolved in 20 microL acetone. Take 2 microL for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Chromatographic conditions were: column DB-1 (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 microns), injector 260 degrees C, interface 250 degrees C, column oven with temperature program: [equation: see text] Helium carrier gas flow rate was 1.8 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was adjustd to record the ion m/z352 for CLP and DCLP, and m/z 256 for DAP in quantitation. The minimum detection limits were 0.1 microgram/L for CLP and 0.2 microgram/L for DCLP. The standard curves of CLP and DCLP were linear between 1-128 micrograms/L (rCLP = 0.998, rDCLP = 0.999). Recoveries of two substances were better than 83%, and the RSD values were less than 10%. This method has been successfully used in clinical pharmacokinetic study of CLP before and after CYP1A2 inhibitor used. The results indicate that the metabolism of clozapine is strongly affected by CYP1A2 activity.
supine systolic blood pressure	BP	Sibutramine treatment in obesity results in significantly greater weight reduction compared with placebo, although weight loss with sibutramine may be accompanied by small but statistically significant mean increases in blood pressure (BP). This 52-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study investigated the effects of sibutramine 20 mg once daily or placebo on body weight in 220 obese (body mass index (BMI) 27-40 kg/m2), hypertensive patients. At randomisation, hypertension was well controlled (< or = 95 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy. Therapy for hypertension continued for the 52 weeks of the study. Sibutramine 20 mg produced significantly greater weight loss compared with placebo: 4.5 kg with sibutramine compared with 0.4 kg with placebo (last observation carried forward (LOCF); P < or = 0.05). A total of 62 patients (42.8%) treated with sibutramine lost < or = 5% of their body weight compared with six patients (8.3%) treated with placebo; 19 patients (13.1%) treated with sibutramine lost > or = 10% of their body weight compared with two patients (2.8%) treated with placebo (LOCF; P < or = 0.05 for both comparisons). Hypertension remained well controlled for the 52 weeks of the study with both sibutramine and placebo treatment. After 52 weeks, the differences between placebo treatment and sibutramine treatment for both mean supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were approximately 3 mm Hg: mean DBP was 82.8 mm Hg with placebo treatment compared with 85.5 mm Hg with sibutramine treatment (LOCF; P = 0.004) and mean SBP was 130.4 mm Hg with placebo compared with 133.1 mm Hg with sibutramine (LOCF; P = 0.0497; both comparisons, sibutramine vs placebo). The mean increases in SBP and DBP did not appear to change the overall risk category for coronary heart disease end points. Changes in pulse rate at week 52 were a decrease of 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) for placebo treatment compared with an increase of 5.7 bpm for sibutramine treatment (P < 0.001). Mandated withdrawals from the study due to protocol-defined changes in BP were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Greater favourable changes in lipid profile, serum glucose, and uric acid could be accounted for by greater weight losses occurring in the sibutramine treatment group. Sibutramine was well tolerated. This study indicates that in obese patients whose hypertension is well controlled at the outset with an ACE inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy, sibutramine safely and effectively achieves weight loss without compromising good BP control.

Hypertension remained well controlled for the 52 weeks of the study with both sibutramine and placebo treatment. After 52 weeks, the differences between placebo treatment and sibutramine treatment for both mean supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were approximately 3 mm Hg: mean DBP was 82.8 mm Hg with placebo treatment compared with 85.5 mm Hg with sibutramine treatment (LOCF; P = 0.004) and mean SBP was 130.4 mm Hg with placebo compared with 133.1 mm Hg with sibutramine (LOCF; P = 0.0497; both comparisons, sibutramine vs placebo). The mean increases in SBP and DBP did not appear to change the overall risk category for coronary heart disease end points. Changes in pulse rate at week 52 were a decrease of 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) for placebo treatment compared with an increase of 5.7 bpm for sibutramine treatment (P < 0.001). Mandated withdrawals from the study due to protocol-defined changes in BP were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Greater favourable changes in lipid profile, serum glucose, and uric acid could be accounted for by greater weight losses occurring in the sibutramine treatment group. Sibutramine was well tolerated. This study indicates that in obese patients whose hypertension is well controlled at the outset with an ACE inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy, sibutramine safely and effectively achieves weight loss without compromising good BP control.
beats per minute	bpm	Sibutramine treatment in obesity results in significantly greater weight reduction compared with placebo, although weight loss with sibutramine may be accompanied by small but statistically significant mean increases in blood pressure (BP). This 52-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study investigated the effects of sibutramine 20 mg once daily or placebo on body weight in 220 obese (body mass index (BMI) 27-40 kg/m2), hypertensive patients. At randomisation, hypertension was well controlled (< or = 95 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy. Therapy for hypertension continued for the 52 weeks of the study.

Polyglucosan bodies	PGBs	Polyglucosan bodies (PGBs) in the brain of a 12-year-old Holstein cow exhibiting no signs of neurological abnormality were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. PGBs were disseminated throughout the brain, especially in the pallidum, thalamus and cerebellum. Cow PGBs were found in the neuronal perikaryon and in the neuropil. These were round, slightly to severely basophilic, and were strongly positive for the periodic acid-Schiff reaction. The cow PGBs were immunoreactive for monoclonal antibodies raised against human polyglucosan. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that they were composed of branching filaments, glycogen granules and electron-dense material. These findings indicate that cow PGBs closely resemble human or canine PGBs in Lafora's disease and PGBs found in aged animals that have been reported previously.
uterine papillary serous carcinoma	UPSC	Improved survival in surgical stage I patients with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) treated with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.
Uterine papillary serous carcinoma	UPSC	OBJECTIVE: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive form of endometrial cancer characterized by a high recurrence rate and a poor prognosis. Prior studies evaluating treatment of UPSC have been limited by small numbers of patients and inclusion of partially staged patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and vaginal cuff radiation in a large cohort of surgical stage I UPSC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 74 stage I patients with UPSC who underwent complete surgical staging at our institution between 1987 and 2004. RESULTS: Stage IA patients were divided into two groups: patients with no cancer in the hysterectomy specimen (defined as no residual uterine disease) and patients with cancer in the hysterectomy specimen (defined as residual uterine disease). Stage IA patients with no residual uterine disease had no recurrences, regardless of adjuvant therapy (n = 12). Stage IA patients with residual uterine disease who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy had no recurrences (n = 7). However, 6 of 14 (43%) stage IA patients with residual uterine disease who did not receive chemotherapy recurred. The 15 patients with stage IB UPSC who received platinum-based chemotherapy had no recurrences but 10 of the 13 (77%) stage IB patients who did not receive chemotherapy recurred. One of the 7 patients with stage IC UPSC who received platinum-based chemotherapy recurred and 4 of the 5 (80%) stage IC patients who did not receive chemotherapy recurred. Overall platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with improved disease-free survival (P < 0.01) and improved overall survival (P < 0.05) in patients with stage I UPSC. None of the 43 patients who received radiation to the vaginal cuff recurred locally, but 6 of the 31 (19%) patients who were not treated with vaginal radiation recurred at the cuff. CONCLUSIONS: Platinum-based chemotherapy improves the disease-free and overall survival of patients with stage I UPSC and vaginal cuff radiation provides local control. Stage IA UPSC patients with no residual uterine disease can be observed but concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy and vaginal cuff radiation (referred to as chemoradiation) should be offered to all other stage I UPSC patients.
mean blood pressure	mbp	'Damping' of an intra-arterial pressure waveform theoretically affects systolic and diastolic blood pressure whilst mean blood pressure (mbp) continues to be reliable. We assessed changes in mbp associated with 79 episodes of damping in 30 infants. The average mbp in the hour just before damping occurred was compared with that in the first hour of damping. The mean change in mbp was -0.845 mmHg. In 50% of cases this change was < 2 mmHg and in 24% of episodes > or = 4.1 mmHg. Damping may produce clinically significant changes in mbp which computer trend data may help to differentiate.
major histocompatibility complex II	MHC-II	It has been reported that tracheal tissue treated by cryopreservation can be used for tracheal replacement in the absence of immunosuppressants. However, the mechanism of reduced antigenicity is unclear. We investigated this issue in cryopreserved rat trachea using detailed histologic evaluation. Rat tracheal segments were preserved in a cryopreservative solution at -85 degrees C. The epithelium of tracheal segments (n = 6 in each group) was subjected to light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic examination before freezing and after cryopreservation for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The expression of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) was determined using frozen sections. Ultrastructure of dendritic cells (DCs) was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Tracheal epithelium was partially intact even after 6 months in cryopreservation, although cellularity decreased with time. MHC-II antigen expression was detected even at 6 months, although expression was lower than that measured on fresh tissue. Tracheal tissue DCs displayed dilatations of perinuclear cisterna and degeneration of vacuoles. Density of the mitochondrial matrix was increased. These results suggest that damage to the epithelium and DCs during cryopreservation and concomitant loss of MHC-II expression might explain the reduction of antigenicity.

subarachnoid hemorrhage	SAH	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to better clarify the risks associated with cigarette smoking and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: The study included 432 incident cases of SAH frequency matched to 473 community SAH-free controls to determine dose-dependent associations of active and passive smoking (at home) and smoking cessation with SAH. RESULTS: Compared with never smokers not exposed to passive smoking, the adjusted odds ratio for SAH among current smokers was 5.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 8.1); for past smokers, 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.0); and for passive smokers, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5). Current and lifetime exposures showed a clear dose-dependent effect, and risks appeared more prominent in women and for aneurysmal SAH. Approximately 1 in 3 cases of SAH could be attributed to current smoking, but risks decline quickly after smoking cessation, even among heavy smokers. CONCLUSIONS: A strong positive association was found between cigarette smoking and SAH, especially for aneurysmal SAH and women, which is virtually eliminated within a few years of smoking cessation. Large opportunities exist for preventing SAH through smoking avoidance and cessation programs.

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty	PTCA	Restenosis is the usual mechanism of recurrent myocardial ischaemia in the months following successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Control coronary arteriography may occasionally show another cause: the constitution of a new stenosis near the dilated segment or in the left main coronary stem after angioplasty in a branch of this artery. The authors report 4 cases of patients who developed new coronary stenoses within a few weeks of PTCA, interpreted as traumatic complications of the initial procedure due to a lesion of the intima with a secondary fibrotic reaction and luminal narrowing. The guiding catheter was probably responsible for the trauma to the left main coronary stem whereas the tips of either the balloon catheter or the guide wire were thought to have been responsible for the endothelial effraction of the dilated vessels.
paramedian pontine reticular formation	PPRF	Spatio-temporal recoding of rapid eye movement signals in the monkey paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF).
paramedian pontine reticular formation	PPRF	The integrity of the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) is necessary for the generation of rapid eye movements. The main saccade-related population is of the burst type with latencies between 0 and 40 ms preceding a saccade, and they can be divided into medium- and long-lead burst neurons. Burst neurons have predominantly spatially coded movement fields in the rostral PPRF, while in the caudal PPRF they increase their burst strength in temporal coding approximately in the pulling directions of extraocular eye muscles (i.e. almost horizontal or vertical). Both neuronal populations have ipsilateral on-directions and contain long-lead burst neurons. In a quantitative analysis the firing patterns of long-lead burst neurons are compared to those of medium-lead burst neurons, which form the predominant output of the saccadic pulse generator to the motoneurons. The firing patterns of temporally coded long-lead bursters are similar to those of medium-lead bursters, except for earlier on-latencies, larger statistical fluctuations, and specializations for small or large saccades in oblique directions. The spatially coded burst neurons form a motor map of saccadic vectors. The diameter of their movement field is often about the size of the saccade vector, and they encode saccadic onset and duration. These results are consistent with a model for visual saccades in eye displacement coordinates, where the spatio-temporal recording of horizontal eye movements is effected by long-lead burst neurons in the PPRF.
Clinical Evaluation Tool	CET	This article describes an approach to the evaluation of students' clinical performance. Specifically, the paper describes: (a) the history of the evaluation of clinical performance in nursing education; (b) the development of the Clinical Evaluation Tool (CET), an instrument designed to measure the clinical performance of nursing students across settings; and (c) the relationships between basic baccalaureate nursing students' scores on the CET and the following variables: age, college credits earned prior to entry to the program, grade point average at entry, college aptitude, and moral reasoning.
(-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol	Cyp	The distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in slide-mounted sections of guinea-pig kidney has been examined by the technique of in vitro labelling combined with autoradiography. Binding of (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (Cyp) to kidney sections equilibrated and dissociated slowly, was saturable and stereoselective with respect to the isomers of propranolol and pindolol. These characteristics were appropriate for binding to beta-adrenoceptors. Delineation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was achieved by use of betaxolol (beta 1-adrenoceptors) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenoceptors) and computer assisted curve fitting techniques. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in the proportions 1:2. 3H-Ultrofilm images of (-)-[125I]-Cyp binding to guinea-pig kidney sections showed localized patches of binding in the cortex and concentrated binding in the outer stripe of the medulla. Cortical receptors were of the beta 1 subtype and those associated with the outer stripe of the medulla were of the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. beta 1-Adrenoceptors were concentrated over glomeruli and beta 2-adrenoceptors over the straight portion of the proximal tubule.
Alpha coma	AC	Alpha coma (AC), theta coma (TC) and alpha-theta coma (ATC) are transient clinical-electroencephalographic phenomena which do not differ from each other in etiology or outcome and are indicative of a severe disturbance in thalamo-cortical physiology. Although most patients do poorly, these patterns are not reliably predictive of outcome, regardless of etiology. We found that AC, TC or ATC usually change to a more definitive pattern by 5 days from coma onset. EEG reactivity in subsequent patterns is relatively favorable, while a burst-suppression pattern without reactivity is unfavorable in anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

magnetic resonance imaging	MRI	Cellular volume of hepatocytes entrapped in alginate gel beads were evaluated under in vivo conditions in samples having different cell densities by applying mathematical models to the diffusion data obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The calculated average volume is in good agreement with the values from the literature-- being closer to the data relative to living tissue than to isolated cells. The non invasive characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging make this method particularly well suited to obtain information from the intact system.
ornithine transcarbamylase	OTC	Two DNA markers, a random DNA fragment 754 and the cDNA sequence encoding the gene for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) have been studied in kindreds segregating for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 754 and OTC are located close physically to the mutation in the region Xp21 below the breakpoints in two Duchenne females. The genetic distance was found to be approximately 10cM between 754 and DMD (two crossovers in 26 meioses) and to be approximately 10cM between OTC and DMD (two crossovers in 26 meioses). Physical data suggest the order DMD-754-OTC. The frequency of recombination compared to physical distance between these markers and DMD suggests that there may be a hot spot of recombination. The relevance of these observations for the isolation of the DMD mutation and clinical use of these probes is discussed.
encephalomyocarditis virus	EMCV	To investigate the epitope(s) on encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) involved in neutralization, two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAs) (MA UM 21.1 and MA UM 21.2) were tested in a competition binding assay (CBA), a mixed neutralization test and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with specificity for the detection of idiotypes on MAs. With a CBA in cell culture, using EMCV infected L cell monolayers as binding antigen, strong homologous competition was observed between unlabelled MAs and horse radish peroxidase (HRPO-) labelled MAs but considerable heterologous competition did also occur, especially between the unlabelled MA UM 21.1 and HRPO-labelled MA UM 21.2. In the mixed neutralization test (50% plaque reduction) preincubation with slightly neutralizing or nonneutralizing doses of MA UM 21.2 had no diminishing effect on the neutralizing capacity of MA UM 21.1, the PRT50 value remains in all cases -10log titre of 5.8. Furthermore rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the idiotypes of MAs UM 21.1 and UM 21.2 did not cross react in the EIA. In conclusion both MAs recognize different viral determinants as indicated by the results obtained with a CBA, a mixed neutralization test and an EIA for detection of idiotypes on MAs.

acute type-A dissection of the aorta	AADA	The natural course of acute type-A dissection of the aorta (AADA) implies a mortality of 50% within the initial 2 days. Preoperative diagnostic tests have to be expeditious while avoiding hypertension and direct manipulation of the aneurysm to prevent aortic rupture. Since 1979, 51 patients have been operated upon for AADA. The diagnosis was established by one or more of the following methods: transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); conventional angiography (CA); intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA); and computed tomography with bolus injection of contrast medium (CT). TTE (n = 26) showed a dissection in 72%, suggested an intimal flap in 25%, and missed the diagnosis in 1 case. CT (n = 15) and DSA (n = 10) failed to indicate dissection in 1 case each. CA (n = 27) demonstrated dissection in every case but was the most time-consuming and stressful method. Since the introduction of combined transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, no other diagnostic methods have been used. On the basis of this experience, we propose the following diagnostic plan: 1. in AADA, the demonstration of an intimal flap in the ascending aorta by TTE/TEE is an indication for immediate surgery without further diagnostic measures (10 patients: no false-positive findings); 2. if a dissection is suggested by TTE/TEE, then DSA is performed if the supra-aortic branches are suspected to be compromised; CT is preferred if an extrapericardial aortic rupture is suspected; 3. the time-consuming and stressful diagnostic approach of conventional angiography is no longer indicated.

TTE (n = 26) showed a dissection in 72%, suggested an intimal flap in 25%, and missed the diagnosis in 1 case. CT (n = 15) and DSA (n = 10) failed to indicate dissection in 1 case each. CA (n = 27) demonstrated dissection in every case but was the most time-consuming and stressful method. Since the introduction of combined transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, no other diagnostic methods have been used. On the basis of this experience, we propose the following diagnostic plan: 1. in AADA, the demonstration of an intimal flap in the ascending aorta by TTE/TEE is an indication for immediate surgery without further diagnostic measures (10 patients: no false-positive findings); 2. if a dissection is suggested by TTE/TEE, then DSA is performed if the supra-aortic branches are suspected to be compromised; CT is preferred if an extrapericardial aortic rupture is suspected; 3. the time-consuming and stressful diagnostic approach of conventional angiography is no longer indicated.
computed tomography with bolus injection of contrast medium	CT	The natural course of acute type-A dissection of the aorta (AADA) implies a mortality of 50% within the initial 2 days. Preoperative diagnostic tests have to be expeditious while avoiding hypertension and direct manipulation of the aneurysm to prevent aortic rupture.

diethylstilbestrol	DES	A study comparing Zoladex 3.6 mg depot with diethylstilbestrol (DES) 3 mg/day was initiated in August 1985. One hundred ninety-three patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer T3/4 or M1 have been randomized up to 31 March 1987: 95 to Zoladex, 98 to DES. No patient had received prior systemic therapy. There is no bias in the treatment groups in terms of baseline characteristics. Median follow-up is 11 months, and the response rate at 12 months from randomization (CR + PR) for Zoladex is 70 +/- 9.4% and 50 +/- 10.1% for DES. Median time to best response is 6 months for Zoladex and 12 months for DES (using the Kaplan-Meier life table method). Subjective responses are 56 +/- 10.2% for Zoladex and 44 +/- 10% for DES. Five increases in bone pain were found after the first Zoladex treatment, as well as one increased ureteric obstruction. None required treatment withdrawal. Seventeen patients on DES were withdrawn due to adverse reaction (chi 2 = 4.33, 1df, p less than 0.05). Overall survival at 31 March 1987 is 84% for the Zoladex group and 78% for the DES group. This study has shown that Zoladex is superior to DES in achieving early tumor response in advanced prostate cancer, without causing serious complications warranting withdrawal of treatment.
neural cell adhesion molecule	L1	The gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) has been shown to be located close to the color vision pigment genes in mouse and man. This location has been confirmed by a number of different mapping strategies in both species. With pulsed field gel electrophoresis it has been proposed that L1CAM lies between the RCP, GCP, and GDX, G6PD loci. We report here a reinterpretation of the location of this gene, based on the physical linkage of L1CAM to the more proximal locus DXS15. This places L1CAM between this marker and the color vision genes (RCP, GCP), a region very dense in CpG islands, expected to contain a large fraction of the disease genes assigned to the Xq28 region. In combination with the physical mapping data on Xq28 described previously, this closes the last remaining gap in the map of the Xq27-Xq28 region. This removes the last contradiction between the maps of this region in the genomes of man and mouse, and confirms the close similarity of order and distances of markers between these organisms.
hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction	HPV	The response of pulmonary arteries to hypoxia varies as a function of vessel diameter. Small intrapulmonary resistance arteries are thought to be the main site of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), with hypoxia causing minimal contraction or even dilatation in large, conduit vessels. This has been proposed to reflect a differential distribution of morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct pulmonary artery smooth muscle (PASM) cells. We investigated longitudinal heterogeneity in smooth muscle cells isolated from five regions of the rabbit pulmonary vasculature and could find no evidence of morphological heterogeneity at the level of the light microscope. PASM cells from main (8 mm outer diameter) and branch (5 mm) arteries and large ( 400 m) intrapulmonary arteries (IPA) were similar in shape and size, as indicated by cell capacitance (25 pF). PASM cells from medium (200-400 m) and small ( 200 m) IPA were significantly smaller (15 pF), but had the same classical spindle shape. Cells from all five regions also had similar resting membrane potentials and displayed voltage-activated K+ currents of similar amplitude when recorded in standard physiological solution. Longitudinal heterogeneity in K+ current became apparent when tetraethylammonium ions (TEA; 10 mM) and glibenclamide (10 M) were added. The remaining delayed rectifier current (IK(V)) doubled in amplitude upon moving down the pulmonary arterial tree from the main artery (9 pA pF-1 at 40 mV) to the large IPA (17 pA pF-1), but remained constant throughout the intrapulmonary vasculature. The O2-sensitive, non-inactivating K+ current (IK(N)) showed a similar trend, but was significantly reduced in the smallest IPA, where its amplitude was comparable with the main artery. Thus the IK(N)/IK(V) ratio was relatively constant, at around 0.14, from the main pulmonary artery to medium IPA, but fell by 50% in the smallest vessels. The amplitude of the TEA-sensitive K+ current was similar (16 pA pF-1 at 40 mV) at all levels of the pulmonary arterial tree, except in the medium sized vessels where it was 50% smaller. These variations in K+ current expression correlate with reported variations in sensitivity to hypoxia and may contribute to the regional heterogeneity of HPV in the rabbit lung.

ammonia	IA	The occurrence of vagally mediated afferent signaling by lung irritants is well known. However, spinal visceral afferent pathways also might be relevant to pulmonary irritation. In the present study, responses and modulation of superficial and deep T3 spinal neurons were examined using inhaled ammonia, and the peripheral afferent fibers were also characterized in part. Extracellular potentials of single thoracic (T3) spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated male rats. Ammonia vapor (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 ml) was injected into the inspiratory line of the ventilator for 20 s. Inhaled ammonia (IA, 1.0 ml) excited 5/6 neurons and inhibited one spinal neuron recorded in superficial laminae, whereas deeper neurons responded with excitatory (E, n = 20), inhibitory (I, n = 4) or biphasic patterns (6 E-I, 3 I-E). Electrical and chemical stimulation of C1-C2 spinal neurons primarily suppressed T3 neuronal responses to IA. Resiniferatoxin (2 microg/kg, i.v.), which desensitizes afferent fibers containing transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV-1), abolished excitatory responses of 8/8 neurons to IA. Bilateral cervical vagotomy did not affect IA responses in 5 superficial neurons while 7 deeper neurons showed variable responses. 82% (32/39) of the spinal neurons responding to IA also received convergent noxious inputs from somatic fields in the chest and back areas. These results suggested that superficial and deeper spinal neuronal activation by inhaled ammonia mainly depended upon pulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers expressing TRPV-1. Additionally, C1-C2 spinal neurons, supraspinal sites and vagal afferents modulated the thoracic spinal neuronal responses to lower airway irritation.

Serine proteinase inhibitor	PI	BACKGROUND: Serine proteinase inhibitor (PI)-9 with a reactive center P1 (Glu)-P1' is a natural antagonist of granzyme B and is expressed in high levels in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In view of the role of CTL in acute rejection, we explored the hypothesis that PI-9 would be hyperexpressed during acute rejection. Because PI-9 can protect CTL from its own fatal arsenal and potentially enhance the vitality of CTL, we examined whether PI-9 levels correlate with the severity of rejection as well as predict subsequent graft function. METHODS: We obtained 95 urine specimens from 87 renal allograft recipients. RNA was isolated from the urinary cells and mRNA encoding PI-9, granzyme B, or perforin and a constitutively expressed 18S rRNA was measured with the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, and the level of expression was correlated with allograft status. RESULTS: The levels of PI-9 (P=0.001), granzyme B (P<0.0001), and perforin mRNAs (P<0.0001), but not the levels of 18S rRNA (P=0.54), were higher in the urinary cells from the 29 patients with a biopsy-confirmed acute rejection than in the 58 recipients without acute rejection. PI-9 levels were significantly higher in patients with type II or higher acute rejection changes compared with those with less than type II changes (P=0.01). Furthermore, PI-9 levels predicted subsequent graft function (r=0.43, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PI-9 mRNA levels in urinary cells are diagnostic of acute rejection, predict renal allograft histology grade, and predict functional outcome following an acute rejection episode.

Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide-Magnetic Resonance Imaging	SPIO-MRI	BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear whether Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SPIO-MRI) is a clinically useful imaging modality for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study searched for the clinical usefulness and limitations of SPIO-MRI with respect to tumor detection capacity, false positive and negative rate, and early recurrence rate. METHODS: From December 1999 to February 2001, 218 patients who were surgical candidates by 3-phase dynamic helical CT (3dHCT) were enrolled. We reviewed the medical records and radiologic findings, retrospectively, and postulated the post-operative pathologic findings and the early recurrences within 3 months as the standards for the true positive lesion. RESULTS: The mean number of nodules detected by SPIO-MRI was significantly more numerous than that of 3dHCT (p<0.01). Modifications of treatment strategy due to the discordant findings between SPIO-MRI and 3dHCT for tumor resectability were observed in 22 (10.1%) out of 218 patients. Early recurrences were observed in 10 patients (7.8%). The false positive and negative rates of SPIO-MRI were 6.3% and 13.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the tumor detection rate of SPIO-MRI was better than that of 3dHCT. Given the relatively acceptable false positive and negative rates, SPIO-MRI could be an appropriate preoperative imaging modality for patients with HCCs.

resting metabolic rate	RMR	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether muscle damage caused from acute resistance exercise with an eccentric overload would influence resting metabolic rate (RMR) up to 72 h postexercise in resistance-trained (RT) and untrained (UT) subjects. METHODS: Nine RT and 9 UT male subjects (mean +/- SD; age = 20.7 +/- 2.1 yr; body mass = 79.0 +/- 1.4 kg; height = 178.4 +/- 3.1 cm; and body fat = 10.2 +/- 1.6%) were measured for RMR, creatine kinase concentration ([CK]), and rating of perceived muscle soreness (RPMS) on five consecutive mornings. To induce muscle damage, after the measurements on day 2, each subject performed leg presses that emphasized the eccentric movement for 8 sets at his six-repetition maximum (6-RM). RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the RMR (kJ x d(-1) and kJ x kg FFM(-1) x h(-1) was significantly elevated for RT and UT at 24 h and 48 h postexercise. From 24 h to 48 h to 72 h postexercise, RMR significantly decreased within both groups. The UT group had a significantly higher RMR at 24 h (9,705.4 +/- 204.5 kJ x d(-1)) and 48 h postexercise (8,930.9 +/- 104.4 kJ x d(-1)) when compared with the RT group (9,209.3 +/- 535.3 and 8,601.7 + 353.7 kJ x d(-1)). Both [CK] and RPMS showed a similar time course. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly higher [CK] for the UT group at 24 h postexercise (320.4 +/- 20.1 U x L(-1)) and for both [CK] and RPMS at 48 h (1,140.3 +/- 37.1 U x L(-1) and 4.4 +/- 0.5, respectively) and 72 h postexercise (675.9 +/- 41.7 U x L(-1) and 1.67 +/- 0.5, respectively) when compared with the RT group (24 h, 201.9 +/- 13.4 U x L(-1); 48 h, 845.4 +/- 30.7 U x L(-1) and 3.7 +/- 0.5: and 72 h postexercise, 420.2 +/- 70.2 U x L(-1) and 0.89 +/- 0.3). These data indicate that eccentrically induced muscle damage causes perturbations in RMR up to 48 h postexercise.
resistance-trained	RT	PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether muscle damage caused from acute resistance exercise with an eccentric overload would influence resting metabolic rate (RMR) up to 72 h postexercise in resistance-trained (RT) and untrained (UT) subjects. METHODS: Nine RT and 9 UT male subjects (mean +/- SD; age = 20.7 +/- 2.1 yr; body mass = 79.0 +/- 1.4 kg; height = 178.4 +/- 3.1 cm; and body fat = 10.2 +/- 1.6%) were measured for RMR, creatine kinase concentration ([CK]), and rating of perceived muscle soreness (RPMS) on five consecutive mornings. To induce muscle damage, after the measurements on day 2, each subject performed leg presses that emphasized the eccentric movement for 8 sets at his six-repetition maximum (6-RM). RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the RMR (kJ x d(-1) and kJ x kg FFM(-1) x h(-1) was significantly elevated for RT and UT at 24 h and 48 h postexercise. From 24 h to 48 h to 72 h postexercise, RMR significantly decreased within both groups. The UT group had a significantly higher RMR at 24 h (9,705.4 +/- 204.5 kJ x d(-1)) and 48 h postexercise (8,930.9 +/- 104.4 kJ x d(-1)) when compared with the RT group (9,209.3 +/- 535.3 and 8,601.7 + 353.7 kJ x d(-1)). Both [CK] and RPMS showed a similar time course. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly higher [CK] for the UT group at 24 h postexercise (320.4 +/- 20.1 U x L(-1)) and for both [CK] and RPMS at 48 h (1,140.3 +/- 37.1 U x L(-1) and 4.4 +/- 0.5, respectively) and 72 h postexercise (675.9 +/- 41.7 U x L(-1) and 1.67 +/- 0.5, respectively) when compared with the RT group (24 h, 201.9 +/- 13.4 U x L(-1); 48 h, 845.4 +/- 30.7 U x L(-1) and 3.7 +/- 0.5: and 72 h postexercise, 420.2 +/- 70.2 U x L(-1) and 0.89 +/- 0.3).

Human Figure Drawings	HFD	This study assessed the concurrent validity of Human Figure Drawings (HFD) and House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawings as measures of self-esteem. Adult subjects were requested to make HFD and HTP drawings and to complete measures of psychological adjustment which included the Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory and Tennessee Self Concept Scale. The drawings were scored using a quantitative, composite rating scale derived from HFD and HTP empirical and theoretical literature on psychological health. Results indicated that neither the HFD nor the HTP quantitative composite ratings of psychological health related to the formal measures of self-esteem.

cerebral arteriovenous malformations	AVMs	Fifty-one patients with 59 angiographically proven cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were examined by high-field MRI to detect blood breakdown products. Results were correlated with the history of intracranial bleeding. Evidence of previous episodes of haemorrhage was seen in 10 of 12 patients (83.3%) with verified bleeding, in 4 of 9 patients (44.4%) with symptoms which could suggest bleeding and in 6 of 30 patients (20%) with negative histories. Because of the known rebleeding rate and the increased risk of associated complications, identification of the subgroup who had had haemorrhage and should therefore be considered for surgery may be beneficial. MRI can make a contribution to management by demonstrating prior haemorrhage in patients with an inadequate clinical history.
central nervous system	CNS	Delivery of diagnostic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) poses several challenges as a result of the special features of CNS blood vessels and tissue fluids. Diffusion barriers exist between blood and neural tissue, in the endothelium of parenchymal vessels (blood-brain barrier, BBB), and in the epithelia of the choroid plexuses and arachnoid membrane (blood-CSF barriers), which severely restrict penetration of several diagnostic imaging agents. The anatomy of large vessels can be imaged using bolus injection of X-ray contrast agents to identify sites of malformation or occlusion, and blood flow measured using MRI and CT, while new techniques permit analysis of capillary perfusion and blood volume. Absolute quantities can be derived, although relative measures in different CNS regions may be as useful in diagnosis. Local blood flow, blood volume, and their ratio (mean transit time) can be measured with high speed tomographic imaging using MRI and CT. Intravascular contrast agents for MRI are based on high magnetic susceptibility agents such as gadolinium, dysprosium and iron. Steady-state imaging using agents that cross the BBB including (123)I- and (99m)Tc-labelled lipophilic agents with SPECT, gives a 'snapshot' of perfusion at the time of injection. Cerebral perfusion can also be measured with PET, using H(2)(15)O, (11)C- or (15)O-butanol, and (18)F-fluoromethane, and cerebral blood volume measured with C(15)O. Recent advances in MRI permit the non-invasive 'labelling' of endogenous water protons in flowing blood, with subsequent detection as a measure of blood flow. Imaging the BBB most commonly involves detecting disruptions of the barrier, allowing contrast agents to leak out of the vascular system. Gd-DTPA is useful in imaging leaky vessels as in some cerebral tumors, while the shortening of T(1) by MR contrast agents can be used to detect more subtle changes in BBB permeability to water as in cerebral ischemia. Techniques for imaging the dynamic activity of the brain parenchyma mainly involve PET, using a variety of radiopharmaceuticals to image glucose transport and metabolism, neurotransmitter binding and uptake, protein synthesis and DNA dynamics. PET methods permit detailed analysis of regional function by comparing resting and task-related images, important in improving understanding of both normal and pathological brain function.
epidermal growth factor	mEGF	Twenty-four adult Merino wethers were given mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) subcutaneously at doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.12 mg/kg body weight or intravenously in the dose range 0.10 to 0.14 mg/kg body weight for periods ranging from 3 to 48 h. Plasma concentrations of mEGF were measured by radioimmunoassay and effects of treatment on food consumption and wool growth were observed. Plasma concentrations of the protein sustained for 15-24 h at about 20 ng mEGF/ml (or exceeding this) almost invariably caused feed rejection and casting of the fleeces. This last result clearly indicated disruption of proliferative activity among the replicating cells in wool follicles which regulate wool growth. The inhibitory effects on appetite and wool growth of smaller doses of the protein and of plasma concentrations equal to those above which were sustained for shorter periods have also been examined. Approximately 10% of the dose of mEGF appeared in the urine of three sheep 1 to 3 days after the start of s.c. infusions of 5 mg for 7 h.
Mitogen-activated protein	MAP	Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been suggested as potential mediators for interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta)-induced gene activation. This study investigated the role of the MAP kinases p38 and ERK2 in IL-1beta-mediated expression of the chemokine MCP-1 by human mesangial cells. Phosphorylation of p38 kinase, which is necessary for activation, increased significantly after IL-1beta treatment. p38 kinase immunoprecipitated from IL-1beta-treated cells phosphorylated target substrates to a greater extent than p38 kinase from controls. SB 203580, a selective p38 kinase inhibitor, was used to examine the role of p38 kinase in MCP-1 expression. SB 203580 decreased IL-1beta-induced MCP-1 mRNA and protein levels, but did not affect MCP-1 mRNA stability. Because NF-kappaB is necessary for MCP-1 gene expression, the effect of p38 kinase inhibition on IL-1beta induction of NF-kappaB was measured. SB 203580 (up to 25 microM) had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation or DNA binding activity. Our previous work showed that IL-1beta also activates the MAP kinase ERK2 in human mesangial cells. PD 098059, a selective inhibitor of the ERK activating kinase MEK1, had no effect on IL-1beta-induced MCP-1 mRNA or protein levels, or on IL-1beta activation of NF-kappaB. These data indicate that p38 kinase is necessary for the induction of MCP-1 expression by IL-1beta, but is not involved at the level of cytoplasmic activation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, ERK2 does not mediate IL-1beta induced MCP-1 gene expression.

cyclopiazonic acid	CPA	Capacitative Ca2+ entry has been examined in several tissues and, in some, appears to be mediated by nonselective cation channels collectively referred to as "store-operated" cation channels; however, relatively little is known about the electrophysiological properties of these channels in airway smooth muscle. Consequently we examined the electrophysiological characteristics and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration associated with a cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)-evoked current in porcine and bovine airway smooth muscle using patch-clamp and Ca2+-fluorescence techniques. In bovine tracheal myocytes, CPA induced an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ that was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was insensitive to nifedipine (an L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor). Using patch-clamp techniques and conditions that block both K+ and Cl- currents, we found that CPA rapidly activated a membrane conductance (I(CPA)) in porcine and bovine tracheal myocytes that exhibits a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential around 0 mV. Replacement of extracellular Na+ resulted in a marked reduction of I(CPA) at physiological membrane potentials (i.e., -60 mV) that was accompanied by a shift in the reversal potential for I(CPA) toward more negative membrane potentials. In addition, I(CPA) was markedly inhibited by 10 microM Gd3+ and La3+ but was largely insensitive to 1 microM nifedipine. We conclude that CPA induces capacitative Ca2+ entry in porcine and bovine tracheal smooth muscle via a Gd3+- and La3+-sensitive, nonselective cation conductance.
Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol	THC	Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was found to reduce the infectivity of herpes simplex virus and was without effect against adenovirus type 2 or poliovirus. The effective THC concentration resulting in an 80% decrement in virus viability was dependent upon the presence or absence of serum in the incubation mixture, as a 5% serum concentration decreased the drug activity by approximately 50-fold. THC-mediated inactivation of herpes simplex virus was both time and dose dependent and did not result in virion disassembly or clumping. The THC-related effect was not influenced by the pH of the suspending medium, suggesting that the mechanism of inactivation differed from that associated with the thermal inactivation of the virus. Thus, the data suggest that THC preferentially reduces the infectivity of the enveloped herpes simplex virus, and that this activity is modulated by the presence of serum proteins.
extracellular matrix	ECM	1. Cardiac fibroblasts play an important regulatory role in cardiac remodelling by undergoing proliferation, differentiation and upregulating various gene products, including some cytokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. A highly potent mediator of cardiac remodelling is angiotensin (Ang) II. 2. In the present study, the suppression subtractive hybridization method was used to identify differentially expressed cDNAs in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts induced by AngII. 3. Following mRNA isolation of non-stimulated and AngII-stimulated cells, cDNAs of both populations were prepared and subtracted by suppression polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of the partially enriched cDNAs identified 36 genes differentially expressed, including ECM proteins (pro-alpha(1) collagen type III, fibronectin), structural protein (spectrin), enzyme (GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase), transcriptional regulators (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper, inhibitor of DNA binding 3) and proteins involved in cell division control (cdc2) or cell signalling (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, mutant p53-binding protein, grp75, CGI-121, protein phosphatase type 2A, tspan-2 and Sam68). 4. The diversity of genes identified in the present study further emphasises the central role of AngII in the regulation of cardiac remodelling.

spontaneously hypertensive	SHR	Ouabain, a cardiac glycoside, binds to the alpha-subunits of Na+, K(+)-ATPase and inhibits Na+ pump activity. It has been proposed that endogenous ouabain, by inhibiting vascular Na+, K(+)-ATPase, can increase vascular resistance and thus may contribute to hypertension. One of the consequences of inhibition of the membrane Na+ pump is enhanced responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasopressor substances. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ouabain can enhance the responsiveness of the vasculature in hypertension. In the present study 100 microM ouabain enhanced the contractile response elicited by phenylephrine in isolated, perfused tail arteries from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. The enhanced contractile response was more pronounced in the arteries of the SHR. We demonstrated that this concentration of ouabain inhibits the Na+ pump activity, measured as ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake, by about 65%, in isolated tail arteries. We conclude that ouabain can sensitize the vascular smooth muscle to the effects of vasopressor substances and this effect is more pronounced in genetically hypertensive rats. Endogenous ouabain may contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension by enhancing vascular tone.

glutamate	Glu	The underlying mechanism(s) of the glutamate (Glu)-induced membrane hyperpolarizing response in identified Euhadra neurons was investigated using the voltage-clamp technique, pressure injection method, and pharmacologic agents. Under voltage-clamp conditions, bath-applied Glu elicits a slow outward potassium current (Glu current) accompanied by an increase in membrane conductance whose amplitude is dose dependent. Of the agonists tested, the Glu current was mimicked only by quisqualate (QA); its potency was approximately 10 times greater than that of Glu. Typical antagonists for the ionotropic type of Glu receptors and G protein inhibitors do not block this current. The Glu current is markedly enhanced by a specific inhibitor of Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII), KN-62 (1-[N,O-bis (1,5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine) in a dose-dependent manner, while intracellularly injected CaM-KII suppresses the current. The potent protein kinase A inhibitors, H-8 (N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride) and H-89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide) or the specific protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and K-252b had no effect on the Glu current. These results suggest the presence of a novel subtype of Glu receptor in Euhadra neurons, which may be coupled to the activation of potassium channels normally suppressed by CaM-KII.

non-human primate	NHP	Similarity of pathology and disease progression make the non-human primate (NHP) model of Lyme neuroborreliosis appropriate and valuable. In the NHP model of Lyme neuroborreliosis, spirochetal density in the nervous system and other tissues has been measured by polymerase chain reaction and correlated to anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid and to inflammation in tissues. Despite the demonstrable presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, only minor inflammation of the central nervous system occurs, though inflammation can be demonstrated in other tissues. Infected animals also develop anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum, although increased amplitude of antibody is not predictive of higher levels of infection. The NHP model continues to provide important insight into the disease process in humans.
homozygous alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency	ATD	Primary prevention in a high-risk group: smoking habits in adolescents with homozygous alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (ATD).
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency	ATD	The serious form of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (ATD) Pi ZZ strongly predisposes the individual for pulmonary emphysema and premature death in adulthood, especially if exposed to tobacco smoking. General screening of all new-born children was conducted in Sweden during 1972-1974, the major purpose being to reduce exposure of the child to parental smoking while growing up and to prevent the child from starting to smoke. Sixty-one children with ATD neonatally identified through mass-screening, and their families, have been compared with a demographically matched control group regarding smoking habits, as studied through interviews and questionnaires on two occasions. When the children were 5-7 years old, the smoking rates among parents of the ATD children and especially among the ATD fathers exceeded smoking rates for controls. Thirteen years later no differences in parental smoking were found between the groups. At 18-20 years of age the ATD children reported smoking significantly less than the control children (p < 0.05). From the perspective of prevention, the goal of the neonatal screening to reduce the smoking rates among the parents of the ATD children was not attained, while it was achieved among the ATD children. The results indicate that a screening program with early detection of ATD effectively prevents adolescent children from starting to smoke. From ethical, medical and psychological points of view, a voluntary screening program for ATD in pre-adolescence is recommended.
soluble guanylate cyclase	sGC	Heme is a co-factor required for the stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide, and sGC activation by these agents is inhibited by superoxide. Because heme promotes oxidant generation, we examined the influence of rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) with a stable human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) transfection and heme on oxidant generation and cGMP. Culture of PMEC with low serum heme decreased cGMP and the detection of peroxide with 10 microM 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and increased HO-1 further decreased cGMP without altering the peroxide detection under these conditions. Under conditions where heme (30 microM) has been shown to stimulate cGMP production in PMECsby mechanisms involving NO and CO, heme increased the detection of peroxide in a PMEC-dependent manner and HO-1 transfection did not markedly alter the effects heme on peroxide detection. The addition of 1 microM catalase markedly inhibited the effects of heme on peroxide detection whereas increasing (0.1 mM ebselen) or decreasing (depleting glutathione with 7 mM diethylmaleate) rates of intracellular peroxide metabolism or inhibiting the biosynthesis of oxidants (with 10 microM diphenyliodonium or 0.1 mM nitro-L-arginine) had only modest effects. The detection of superoxide by 10 microM dihydroethidium from PMECs was not increased by exposure to heme. These actions of oxidant probes suggest that intracellular oxidants have a minimal influence on the response to heme. Thus, exposure of PMECs to heme causes a complex response involving an extracellular generation of peroxide-derived oxidant species, which do not appear to originate from increases in intracellular superoxide or peroxide. This enables heme and HO to regulate sGC through mechanisms involving NO and CO, which are normally inhibited by superoxide.
nitric oxide	NO	Heme is a co-factor required for the stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide, and sGC activation by these agents is inhibited by superoxide. Because heme promotes oxidant generation, we examined the influence of rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) with a stable human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) transfection and heme on oxidant generation and cGMP. Culture of PMEC with low serum heme decreased cGMP and the detection of peroxide with 10 microM 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and increased HO-1 further decreased cGMP without altering the peroxide detection under these conditions. Under conditions where heme (30 microM) has been shown to stimulate cGMP production in PMECsby mechanisms involving NO and CO, heme increased the detection of peroxide in a PMEC-dependent manner and HO-1 transfection did not markedly alter the effects heme on peroxide detection. The addition of 1 microM catalase markedly inhibited the effects of heme on peroxide detection whereas increasing (0.1 mM ebselen) or decreasing (depleting glutathione with 7 mM diethylmaleate) rates of intracellular peroxide metabolism or inhibiting the biosynthesis of oxidants (with 10 microM diphenyliodonium or 0.1 mM nitro-L-arginine) had only modest effects. The detection of superoxide by 10 microM dihydroethidium from PMECs was not increased by exposure to heme. These actions of oxidant probes suggest that intracellular oxidants have a minimal influence on the response to heme. Thus, exposure of PMECs to heme causes a complex response involving an extracellular generation of peroxide-derived oxidant species, which do not appear to originate from increases in intracellular superoxide or peroxide.

Association of Official Analytical Chemists	AOAC	A collaborative study was undertaken to assess the degree of variability in disinfectant efficacy test results among laboratories that routinely perform the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Use-Dilution Method. Eighteen laboratories tested identical samples of six EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectants (three phenolics and three quaternaries) at the manufacturers' recommended use-dilution using only those modifications of the method approved by the AOAC Use-Dilution Task Force. Each laboratory processed 60 penicylinders for each of the 6 randomly selected disinfectants and 3 test organisms. The current EPA pass criterion for a disinfectant requires a test result of less than or equal to 1 positive penicylinder/60 replicates tested When compared with the 1 positive/60 replicate criterion, the test results of the 6 disinfectants were: 86 trials (80%) passed and 22 trials (20%) failed against Salmonella choleraesuis ATCC 10708; 71 (66%) passed and 37 (34%) failed against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538; and 41 (38%) passed while 67 (62%) failed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442. Four laboratories unknowingly tested their own product, and three of the four failed their product against one or more of the test organisms. These results show the inability to reproduce the manufacturers' bactericidal label claims for 6 disinfectants against the 3 AOAC test bacteria. In addition, extreme variability of test results among laboratories testing identical products questions the use of the AOAC Use-Dilution Method for enforcement action.
bronchoalveolar lavage	BAL	Hyperoxia and infused granulocytes act synergistically in producing a nonhydrostatic high-permeability lung edema in the isolated perfused rabbit lung within 4 h, which is substantially greater than that seen with hyperoxia alone. We hypothesized that the interaction between hyperoxia and granulocytes was principally due to a direct effect of hyperoxia on the lung itself. Isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were preexposed to 2 h of hyperoxia (95% O2-5% CO2) prior to the infusion of unstimulated granulocytes (under normoxic conditions) developed significant nonhydrostatic lung edema (P = 0.008) within 2 h when compared with lungs that were preexposed to normoxia (15% O2-5% CO2) prior to granulocyte perfusion. The edema in the hyperoxic-preexposed lungs was accompanied by significant increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein, BAL granulocytes, BAL thromboxane and prostacyclin levels, perfusate chemotactic activity, and lung lipid peroxidation. These findings suggest that the synergistic interaction between hyperoxia and granulocytes in producing acute lung injury involves a primary effect of hyperoxia on the lung itself.
Progesterone	P	Progesterone (P) to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of ovariectomized (OVX), estradiol benzoate (EB)-primed rats and hamsters produces female sexual behavior similar to that seen in proestrous, receptive rodents. Because P's 5alpha-reduced metabolites can have facilitative effects on female sexual receptivity through actions at GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs), the role of 5alpha-reductase and GBRs in the VMH and the VTA was investigated. In Experiment 1, 5alpha-reductase immunoreactivity (5alpha-red-IR) and GBR immunoreactivity (GBR-IR) in the VMH and the VTA of OVX, EB (10 microg) and P (500 microg)-primed rats and hamsters was examined. More 5alpha-red-IR and GBR-IR was seen in the VMH and the VTA of receptive (EB and P-primed) compared to non-receptive (sesame oil vehicle) rodents. In Experiment 2, OVX, EB and P-primed rats and hamsters received implants of finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, or no implants to the VMH and the VTA and were tested for sexual receptivity with a male. Ovariectomized EB and P-primed rats and hamsters receiving finasteride to the VMH and the VTA had decreased lordosis compared to rodents receiving control implants to the VMH and the VTA. In Experiment 3, OVX, EB and P-primed rats and hamsters received infusions of picrotoxin, a GBR antagonist, or vehicle infusion to the VMH and the VTA and were tested for sexual receptivity with a male. Ovariectomized EB and P-primed rats and hamsters receiving picrotoxin to the VMH and the VTA had decreased lordosis compared to rodents receiving vehicle infusions to the VMH and the VTA. These data suggest that 5alpha-reductase and GBRs are present in the VMH and VTA, and that inhibiting 5alpha-reductase activity or blocking GBRs in the VMH and the VTA attenuates EB+P-primed sexual receptivity of OVX rats and hamsters.

National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators	NDNQI	The valid measurement of nurses' job satisfaction is critical because job satisfaction is important for the retention of qualified nurses to provide patient care in hospitals. Two studies were conducted to adapt the Stamps Index of Work Satisfaction (1997b) to measure work satisfaction at the patient care unit level for use by the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). In Study 1 (n = 918 RNs) exploratory factor analysis of data obtained using the NDNQI-Adapted Index replicated the conceptual dimensions of the Stamps measure. Associations with scores on Job Enjoyment were evidence that the Index measured the intended construct. Using theta, the reliability of the composite subscales was .91. The adapted Work Satisfaction subscale scores explained 46% of the variance in Job Enjoyment, with each subscale contributing uniquely (p < .001). In Study 2 (n = 2277 RNs) confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling supported the 7-subscale structure for the Adapted Index (CFI [719] = .88; RMR = .05). Replication of associations between scores on the Index subscales and Job Enjoyment provided further evidence regarding validity of the data, since the Work Satisfaction subscales explained 56% of the variance in Job Enjoyment. The feasibility of using an on-line version of the Adapted-Index for data collection was demonstrated. The findings from the two studies indicate that the adapted Index of Work Satisfaction has a structure similar to the original instrument and is a reliable and valid measure of work satisfaction at the patient care unit level.
adenosine triphosphate	ATP	Adenine nucleotide pools and their energy charge were measured during balanced and unbalanced growth of photoheterotrophic Chromatium cultures. The methods used involved rapid sampling, accurate to within 1 s, from isotopically labeled cultures followed by chromatographic separation of individual nucleotides. During balanced growth, both energy charge and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations, whether expressed as a function of cell protein or intracellular water, were slightly higher in limiting light intensities than in cultures growing at their maximal rate in bright light. The ATP found corresponded to 4.67 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg of protein or 1.34 +/- 0.57 mM for low-light cells and to 4.41 +/- 0.58 mmol/mg of protein or 0.85 +/- 0.12 mM for high-light cells. Corresponding energy charges were 0.85 +/- 0.02 and 0.81 +/- 0.02. Illumination shifts caused differential synthesis of photosynthetic pigments lasting 2 to 3 h without corresponding perturbation of adenine nucleotide levels. Cultures in intermittent illumination were severely affected by some cycle durations; they had abnormal morphology and very high bacteriochlorophyll-to-protein ratios. In such cultures, energy charge and nucleotide concentrations were within normal limits and relaxed to the dark steady state during the dark periods. Arsenate at AsO(4) (3-) to PO(4) (3-) ratios of 10:1 in the medium retarded growth, but no abnormality of charge or quantity of phosphate-containing nucleotides was found. These experiments therefore suggest that, within experimental error, neither the size nor the charge of the adenylate pools governs growth rate in Chromatium. Moreover, these parameters do not appear to be concerned in regulating the synthesis of photosynthetic apparatus in this organism.
Protease-activated receptor 2	PAR 2	BACKGROUND: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2) has been shown to be responsible for trypsin and mast cell tryptase-induced airway inflammation. Here, the present study aimed to explore the expression of PAR 2 in the nasal mucosa of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: Study subjects were recruited for the study by medical history, physical examination and laboratory screening tests. Using immunohistochemistry, laser-assisted cell picking and subsequently real-time PCR, nasal mucosa biopsies of SAR patients were investigated for PAR 2 gene and protein expression in complex tissues of the nasal mucosa. RESULTS: Gene and protein expression of PAR 2 was firstly detected in nasal mucosa of SAR patients. The relative gene expression level of PAR 2 was significantly increased in complex tissues of the nasal mucosa of SAR (6.21+/-4.02 vs. controls: 1.38+/-0.86, P=0.004). Moreover, PAR 2 mRNA expression in epithelial cells (SAR: 4.78+/-4.64 vs. controls: 0.84+/-0.61, P=0.003) but not in mucus (SAR: 1.51+/-1.15 vs. controls: 1.35+/-1.02, P=0.78) and endothelial cells (SAR: 1.20+/-0.57 vs. controls: 1.73+/-1.30, P=0.5) was found to be significantly changed in the nasal mucosa in SAR. Using double immunohistochemistry the present study demonstrated that the total numbers of mast cells (P=0.0003) and eosinophils (P=0.03) and the numbers of eosinophils expressing PAR 2 (P=0.006) were significantly elevated in the nasal mucosa of SAR compared with the controls. CONCLUSION: The abundant presence and distribution of gene and protein expression of PAR 2 in different cell types in the nasal mucosa under normal situation, the increased expression of PAR 2 in epithelial cells and the increased number of eosinophils with PAR 2 suggest that PAR 2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as SAR.

isolated central nervous system	CNS	A comparison was made of neurite growth across spinal cord lesions in the isolated central nervous system (CNS) of newborn opossums (Monodelphis domestica) at various stages of development. The aim was to define the critical period at which growth after injury ceases to occur, with emphasis on growth-inhibitory proteins, myelin and glial cells. In postnatal opossums 3-6 days old (P3-6), repair was observed 5 days after lesions were made in culture at the cervical level (C7) by crushing with forceps. Through-conduction of action potentials was re-established and axons stained by Dil grew into and beyond the crush. In a series of 66 animals 29 showed repair. In 28 animals at P11-12 with comparable lesions repair was observed in five preparations. At P13-14, the CNS was still viable in culture, but none of the 25 preparations examined showed any axonal growth into the crush or conduction through it. The rostro-caudal gradient of development permitted lesions to be made in mature cervical and immature lumbar regions of P11-12 spinal cord. Growth across crushes occurred in lumbar but not in cervical segments of the same preparation. The development of glial cells and myelin was assessed by electron microscopy and by staining with specific antibodies (Rip-1 and myelin-associated glycoprotein) in cervical segments of neonatal P6-14 opossums. At P8, oligodendrocytes and thin myelin sheaths started to appear followed at P9 by astrocytes stained with antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein. By P14, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and well-developed myelin sheaths were abundant. The cervical crush sites of P12 cords contained occasional astrocytes but no oligodendrocytes. Specific antibodies (IN-1) to neurite growth-inhibiting proteins (NI-35/250) associated with oligodendrocytes and myelin in the rat CNS cross-reacted with opossum proteins. Assays using the spreading of 3T3 fibroblasts and IN-1 showed that by P7 inhibitory proteins became apparent, particularly in the hindbrain and cervical spinal cord. The concentrations of NI-35/250 thereafter increased and became abundant in the adult opossum. Our finding of a well-defined critical period, encompassing only 5 days, in CNS preparations that can be maintained in culture offers advantages for analysing mechanisms that promote or prevent CNS repair.
deoxynivalenol	DON	The influence of heating temperature and time on deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV) and zearalenone (ZEA) contents in naturally co-contaminated barley and wheat was investigated intending to establish the basis for a decontamination model of Fusarium mycotoxins in cereals. The standard toxins and whole barley powder samples were heated in a convection oven at 140, 160, 180, 200, or 220 degrees C, and kernel subsamples (200 g each) were roasted in an experimental rotary gas-fired roaster at 150, 180 or 220 degrees C. All treatments resulted in a time-temperature-dependent decomposition of the toxins; the logarithm of the toxin remaining % presented a linear relationship with heating time. The lines equations were used to estimate the half (H) and decimal (D) decomposition times (time required to destroy 50 or 90% of the toxin, respectively). DON and NIV H and D decomposition times were similar and 50% shorter for heated standards than for whole barley powder. ZEA standard values were considerably longer, while whole barley powder values were comparable with those of DON and NIV. At 220 degrees C, D decomposition times of DON, NIV and ZEA heated standards were 11, 10 and 85 min, respectively, while the values obtained in whole barley powder were the same for the three toxins (25 min). The determination of H and D decomposition values constitutes a basis to understand the heating stability nature of each toxin.

botulinum toxin-A	BtA	This paper provides a review of the research literature that reports on the effectiveness of botulinum toxin-A (BtA) to reduce tone and improve functional use of the upper limbs of children who have cerebral palsy. Evaluation of the findings suggest that injections of BtA have demonstrated promising short-term results by reducing tone and increasing active range of motion in some children. Positive changes in function were also reported, however, only four studies used valid functional outcome measures. Children appropriate for BtA injections may be those with moderate tone, adequate grip strength, some distal voluntary control, intact sensation, and motivation to participate in postinjection training. Future research examining functional outcomes and the effect of repeated injections is needed. Active involvement of occupational therapists in the development and investigation of the most appropriate postinjection upper-limb training may help ensure optimal outcomes for children with cerebral palsy.
wireless capsule endoscopy	WCE	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic yield of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) and enteroclysis in evaluating the extent of small-bowel involvement in Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Thirty-one patients (20 men; mean age, 43 y) with endoscopically and histologically proven CD underwent enteroclysis as their initial examination, followed by WCE. The radiologist who performed the small-bowel enema was blinded to the results of standard index endoscopy, which included retrograde ileoscopy. Gastroenterologists were blinded to the results of enteroclysis at the time of interpretation of the WCE video. RESULTS: Abnormal findings were documented in 8 of 31 patients by using enteroclysis and in 22 of 31 patients by using WCE (25.8% vs. 71%, P < .001). In 16 patients with known involvement of the terminal ileum, the diagnostic yield of WCE vs enteroclysis was significantly superior (89% vs 37%, P < .001). In 15 patients without lesions in the terminal ileum, abnormal findings in the proximal small bowel were detected in 7 (46%) patients by WCE and only in 2 (13%) patients by enteroclysis (P < .001). The capsule detected all but 2 lesions diagnosed by enteroclysis. WCE detected additional lesions that were not detected by enteroclysis in 45% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: WCE is superior to enteroclysis in estimating the presence and extent of small-bowel CD. WCE may be a new gold standard for diagnosing ileal involvement in patients with CD without strictures and fistulae.

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias	IIPs	Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) are a collection of pulmonary fibrotic diseases of unknown etiopathogenesis. CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is expressed in IIP biopsies and primary fibroblast lines, but its role in pulmonary fibrosis was not previously examined. To study the in vivo role of CCR7 in a novel model of pulmonary fibrosis, 1.0 x 10(6) primary fibroblasts grown from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, or histologically normal biopsies were injected intravenously into C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/beige (bg) mice. At days 35 and 63 after idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia fibroblast injection, patchy interstitial fibrosis and increased hydroxyproline were present in the lungs of immunodeficient mice. Adoptively transferred nonspecific interstitial pneumonia fibroblasts caused a more diffuse interstitial fibrosis and increased hydroxyproline levels at both times, but injected normal human fibroblasts did not induce interstitial remodeling changes in C.B-17SCID/bg mice. Systemic therapeutic immunoneutralization of either human CCR7 or CC ligand 21, its ligand, significantly attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis in groups of C.B-17SCID/bg mice that received either type of IIP fibroblasts. Thus, the present study demonstrates that pulmonary fibrosis is initiated by the intravenous introduction of primary human fibroblast lines into immunodeficient mice, and this fibrotic response is dependent on the interaction between CC ligand 21 and CCR7.

phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen	pPE	The Zellweger syndrome is a lethal hereditary disease characterized by the absence of peroxisomes (microbodies) in liver and kidney, and variable abnormalities in mitochondria. We show here that tissues from five infants that had died of this syndrome contain less than 10% of the normal levels of phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (pPE), a major phospholipid component of cellular membranes. Heart and muscle, but not other tissues, also contain a substantial fraction of phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen (pPC), and this fraction is also strongly reduced in the Zellweger patients. No other abnormalities in cellular phospholipids were detected. Key enzymes of the biosynthesis of plasmalogens have previously been shown to be exclusively located in the peroxisomes of rodent liver and the microperoxisomes of rodent brain. We infer that the corresponding enzymes are also located in peroxisomes in man and that the absence of peroxisomes in Zellweger patients leads to their inability to synthesize plasmalogens. Our results support the notion that the biosynthetic role of peroxisomes in mammals has thus far been underestimated. We suggest that the defect in plasmalogen synthesis and possibly as yet unknown peroxisomal reactions are responsible for the diverse abnormalities observed in Zellweger patients.

localized tumor hyperthermia	LTH	Prostate adenocarcinoma, treated with localized tumor hyperthermia (LTH), can potentially serve as a source of tumor antigen, where dying apoptotic/necrotic cells release tumor peptides slowly over time. In addition, LTH-treated cells can release heat shock proteins that can chaperone antigenic peptides to antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. We attempted to discern whether sequential LTH and intratumoral dendritic cell and/or systemic granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) would activate antitumor immune response in a syngeneic murine model of prostate cancer (RM-1). Palpable RM-1 tumors, grown in the distal appendage of C57BL/6 male mice, were subjected to LTH (43.7 degrees C for 1 h) x 2, separated by 5 days. Following the second LTH treatment, animals received either PBS or dendritic cells (2 x 10(6)) intratumorally (every 3 days for three injections). Separate cohorts also received i.v. injection of recombinant adenovirus-expressing murine GM-CSF (AdGMCSF), 1 day after LTH. Control animals received AdenoLacZ or AdenoGFP. Intratumoral dendritic cell injection induced tumor-specific T-helper cell activity (IFNgamma ELISPOTS) and CTL activity, which was further augmented by AdGMCSF, indicating amplification of tumor-specific TH1 immunity. The combination of LTH, AdGMCSF, and intratumoral dendritic cell injection resulted in significant tumor growth delays when compared with animal cohorts that received LTH alone. These results support an in situ autovaccination strategy where systemic administration of GM-CSF and/or intratumoral injection of autologous dendritic cells, when combined with LTH, could be an effective treatment for local and systemic recurrence of prostate cancer.

sleep-disordered breathing	SDB	Patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) suffer from repetitive upper airway occlusion. Various techniques have been described to assess the site of upper airway collapse. In most cases the soft palate or the base of tongue, or both, are the major levels of obstruction; rarely, the larynx, including the epiglottis, are found to be involved. We present five cases in which sleep videoendoscopy finally revealed the true mechanism of the inspiratory airway behavior. Two patients were sent to our service because of inefficacy of nasal ventilation therapy. One had a floppy epiglottis that was being sucked into the glottis. The other had a normal larynx during videoendoscopy. Instead, common pharyngeal collapse could be detected. Increasing the pressure normalized sleep, breathing, and videoendoscopy. The third patient showed apneas due to the adduction of the lateral parts of his omega-shaped epiglottis. In another case, inspiratory fluttering of the vocal cords caused snoring and arousals. The last case came in for bilateral vocal cord palsy with heavy nocturnal desaturations suggesting airway closure. Yet, the pharynx and larynx remained open throughout the night. Sleep videoendoscopy is a convenient method to define the level and mechanism of occlusion in obstructive SDB, particularly if the larynx is involved. It is useful to rule out airway compromise in case of recurrent nocturnal hypoxemias. Thus the results of sleep videoendoscopy have a strong therapeutical impact.
prostate-specific antigen	PSA	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to examine safety and tolerability data from a number of recently completed clinical trials with the novel, dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride. METHODS: Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted on data for dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for drug-related adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels derived from four large, randomised, double-blind clinical trials (n=5655). Further data were derived from a randomised, double-blind combination study of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day (n=327), and several safety studies conducted in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Data from two-year blinded clinical studies demonstrate that dutasteride is well tolerated, with a profile comparable with that of placebo. The exception is a modestly elevated incidence of impotence, decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, and gynaecomastia. Clinical laboratory test abnormalities were reported by <1% of patients treated with dutasteride, and abnormal values occurred with similar frequency versus placebo-treated patients. In a healthy volunteer study, when dutasteride was administered daily for 1 year, it did not significantly affect bone metabolism markers, bone mineral density or lipid profiles. Dutasteride reduced total serum PSA concentrations by approximately 50% following 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment but had no effect on free-to-total PSA levels. The safety profile of dutasteride did not differ from that of finasteride in a large, parallel-group, comparator trial. Additionally, when dutasteride was used in combination with an alpha(1)-blocker, the drug-related adverse event profiles were as would be expected for the individual agents. CONCLUSIONS: Considered together, these data demonstrate dutasteride to be well-tolerated.
Deese, Roediger, and McDermott	DRM	Do participants in the Deese, Roediger, and McDermott (DRM) procedure demonstrate false memory because they think of nonpresented critical words during study and confuse them with words that were actually presented? In two experiments, 160 participants studied eight visually presented DRM lists at a rate of 2 s or 5 s per word. Half of the participants rehearsed silently: the other half rehearsed overtly. Following study, the participants' memory for the lists was tested by recall or recognition. Typical false memory results were obtained for both memory measures. More important, two new results were observed. First, a large majority of the overt-rehearsal participants spontaneously rehearsed approximately half of the critical words during study. Second, critical-word rehearsal at study enhanced subsequent false recall, but it had no effect on false recognition or remember judgments for falsely recognized critical words. Thinking of critical words during study was unnecessary for producing false memory.
tobacco etch potyvirus	TEV	The tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) polyprotein is processed by three virus-encoded proteinases, termed Nla, HC-Pro, and the 35-kDa proteinase. The 35-kDa proteinase is derived from the amino-terminal region of the polyprotein. Analysis of polyproteins containing beta-glucuronidase fused to the expected carboxy terminus of the 35-kDa proteinase confirmed the previously identified Tyr304-Ser305 dipeptide as the cleavage site between the 35-kDa proteinase and HC-Pro. The 35-kDa proteinase of TEV was unable to catalyze proteolysis when synthetic substrate polyproteins were supplied in a bimolecular or trans reaction, suggesting that processing occurs by an autolytic mechanism. The results of a mutational analysis within the 35-kDa proteolytic domain indicated that His214, Asp223, Ser256, and Asp288 were required for optimal autoproteolytic activity. Replacement of Ser256 with either Thr or Cys resulted in low but detectable proteinase activity, as did substitution of Asp223 and Asp288 with Glu. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the 35-kDa proteinase resembles cellular serine-type proteinases, with Ser256 functioning as the nucleophilic residue within the active site. Cleavage mediated by the 35-kDa proteinase has been shown previously to occur after polyprotein synthesis in wheat germ extracts and transgenic plants, but not in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We were able to demonstrate that processing in vitro may require a heat-labile factor present in wheat germ extracts.
human androgen receptor	hAR	The human androgen receptor (hAR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor. We have previously proposed that c-Jun mediates the transcriptional activity of this receptor. The modular nature of hAR was used in this study to generate several fusions with the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 in an attempt to identify the c-Jun-responsive domains within the receptor. Our results suggest that the target of c-Jun action is the amino terminus (AB region) of the receptor and that hAR amino acids 502-521 are critical for the c-Jun response. Additionally, amino acids 503-555 were shown to harbor an autonomous transactivation that is stimulated by c-Jun. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transcription intermediary factor-2 (TIF-2), a coactivator that acts on the activation function-2, stimulates the full-length hAR. These results suggest that c-Jun and TIF-2 can work together as coactivators on the hAR by targeting distinct portions of the receptor.

upstream activation sites	UASs	Transcription of the genomic PHO5, PHO81 and PHO84 genes of the PHO regulon requires Pho4p and Pho2p activity, whereas transcription of PHO8 is directed by Pho4p alone. Pho4p binds to two 9-bp motifs, 5'-GCACGTGGG-3' (type 1. e.g. UASp2 of PHO5 and site D of PHO84) and 5'-GCACGTTTT-3' (type 2, e.g. UASp1 of PHO5 and site E of PHO84) in the PHO promoter. Experiments were performed to evaluate the ability of these 9-bp motifs to function as upstream activation sites (UASs) by insertion of various 36-bp fragments bearing the 9-bp motif in a CYC1-lacZ fusion gene. No expression of the lacZ gene was detected with the 36-bp fragment bearing UASp2 of PHO5, whereas similar 36-bp fragments bearing UASp1 of PHO5 and sites D and E of PHO84 showed UAS activity in response to Pi concentration in the medium and to the pho2 mutation. The Pho2p-responsive UASs are flanked by one or two copies of an A/T-rich segment, whereas UASp2 is not. Gel retardation and competition experiments performed using a T7-Pho2p-His chimeric protein showed that Pho2p binds to the 36-bp fragments bearing A/T-rich segment(s) but not appreciably to the 36-bp fragments not bearing such segment(s). Thus, the A/T segments flanking the PHO UASs are Pho2p binding sites and play an important role in PHO regulation.
non-aqueous-phase-liquid	NAPL	In this study, an attempt has been made to model a real field scenario, whereby an initially almost saturated clay liner in a waste site is gradually drying, due to evaporation at its lower boundary. A detailed conceptual model that deals with the penetration and breakthrough of non-aqueous-phase-liquid (NAPL) in clay liners is introduced. Water content of clay samples was monitored during ambient evaporation through apertures at the base of sample holders. Clay drying rate served as the primary parameter for the NAPL breakthrough study. The interconnection between drying rates, structural damage formation (cracks and suction) and NAPL penetration is especially addressed. The processes taking place in the clay samples during drying appear to be associated with the capillary effects between the different fluid phases in the vicinity of either the NAPL-clay or the clay-air boundaries. A conceptual model of NAPL penetration and breakthrough of the clay layer has been considered, based on both indirect and direct observations of structural damages produced on either clay boundaries. A mutual interaction between these two boundaries is suggested and discussed. NAPL breakthrough is suggested to take place through cracks initiated on the upper soil surface.
heart rate	HR	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of exercise training on meal-induced thermogenesis in 30 female subjects with an average age of 26 years, an average weight of 53.5 kg, and an average height of 162.4 cm. Three groups of 10 subjects were formed with an average maximum aerobic capacity (VO2max) of 57.5 mL X kg-1 X min-1 and a percent body fat of 17.5% for group 1 (competition athletes), of 49.9 mL X kg-1 X min-1 and 21.2% for group 2 (moderately active), and 38.9 mL X kg-1 X min-1 and 22.2% for group 3 (sedentary subjects). Oxygen uptake (VO2), respiratory quotient (R), and heart rate (HR) were measured at intervals for 45 min before and 120 min after a standard meal containing 800 kCal (1 kCal = 4.184 kJ). The increases in VO2 produced by the meal were significantly smaller (P less than 0.05) in group 1 than in group 3. Following the meal, R was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) from its initial value in the three groups, but it remained significantly lower in the well-trained subjects than in the nontrained. HR, which was initially higher (P less than 0.01) in group 3, was slightly increased after the meal, but the response was the same for all groups. These results show a diminished meal-induced thermogenesis in exercise-trained female subjects associated with reduced carbohydrate oxidation.
silacyclobutane	SCB	The gas-phase reaction products of silacyclobutane (SCB) and 1, 1-dideuterio-silacyclobutane (SCB-d(2)) from a hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) chamber were diagnosed in situ using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser single-photon ionization (SPI) coupled with time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. The SCB molecule was found to decompose at a filament temperature as low as 900 degrees C. Both Si- (silylene, methylsilylene, and silene) and C-containing (ethene and propene) species were produced from the SCB decomposition on the filament. Ethene and propene were detected by the mass spectrometer. It is demonstrated that the formation of ethene is favored over that of propene. The experimental study of hot-wire decomposition of SCB-d(2) shows that propene is most likely produced by a process that is initiated by a 1,2-H(D) migration to form n-propylsilylene, followed by an equilibration with silacyclopropane, which then decomposes to propene. The detection of ethene in our experiment indicates that a competitive route of fragmentation exists for SCB decomposition on the filament. It has been shown that this competitive route occurs without H/D scrambling. The highly reactive silylene, silene, and methylsilylene species produced from SCB decomposition underwent either insertion reactions into the Si-H bonds of the parent molecule or pi-type addition reaction across the double and triple CC bonds. The dimerization product of silene, 1,3-disilacyclobutane, at m/z = 88 was also observed.

Epstein-Barr virus	EBV	The application of a new screening procedure which utilizes the synergistic effect of short-chain fatty acids and tumor-promoting diterpene esters enabled rapid and easy detection of environmental substances with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-activating/tumor-promoting potency. Over 500 samples were tested and more than 30 substances with such activities were identified. Most, if not all, were plant diterpene esters derived from Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families and a few were indole alkaloids of microbial origin. We attempted to link these laboratory findings with those of epidemiological field studies on three virus-associated diseases, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which are known to have a peculiar geographical distribution. Our hypothesis was that EBV-activating/tumor-promoting substances might be present in the abundant areas where such diseases are endemic. We noticed that many active diterpene ester-containing plants are widely used as herbal medicaments in Africa and China and determined many plant species that had such activities. One example is Aleurites fordii, a plant commonly grown in Southern China for industrial purposes which yielded a potent promoter substance (12-O-hexadecanoyl-16-hydroxyphorbol-13-acetate, HHPA). The active diterpene esters were purified and their possible mechanism was studied from the view of receptor-binding, protein kinase C activation and transmembrane signaling.

protein kinase C	PKC	In a rat model of morphine tolerance, we examined the hypotheses that thermal hyperalgesia to radiant heat develops in association with the development of morphine tolerance and that both the development and expression of thermal hyperalgesia in morphine-tolerant rats are mediated by central NMDA and non-NMDA receptors and subsequent protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine was developed in rats utilizing an intrathecal repeated treatment regimen. The development of morphine tolerance and thermal hyperalgesia was examined by employing the tail-flick test and paw-withdrawal test, respectively. Intrathecal MK 801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; a non-NMDA receptor antagonist), or GM1 ganglioside (an intracellular PKC inhibitor) treatment was given to examine the effects of these agents on the development and expression of thermal hyperalgesia in morphine-tolerant rats. Tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine was reliably developed in rats following once daily intrathecal (onto the lumbosacral spinal cord) injection of 10 micrograms of morphine sulfate for 8 consecutive days as demonstrated by the decreased analgesia following morphine administration on day 8 as compared to that on day 1. In association with the development of morphine tolerance, thermal hyperalgesia to radiant heat developed in these same rats. Paw-withdrawal latencies were reliably decreased in morphine-tolerant rats as compared to nontolerant (saline) controls when tested on day 8 before the last morphine treatment and on day 10 (i.e., 48 hr after the last morphine treatment). The coincident development of morphine tolerance and thermal hyperalgesia was potently prevented by intrathecal coadministration of morphine with MK 801 (10 nmol) or GM1 (160 nmol), and partially by CNQX (80 nmol). MK 801 (5, 10 nmol, not 2.5 nmol) and CNQX (80, 160 nmol, not 40 nmol), but not GM1 (160 nmol), also reliably reversed thermal hyperalgesia in rats rendered tolerant to morphine when tested 30 min after each drug treatment on day 10 (48 hr after the last morphine treatment). The data indicate that thermal hyperalgesia develops in association with the development of morphine tolerance and that the coactivation of central NMDA and non-NMDA receptors is crucial for both the development and expression of thermal hyperalgesia in morphine-tolerant rats. Furthermore, intracellular PKC activation plays a critical role in the development of thermal hyperalgesia in morphine-tolerant rats. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Mirizzi syndrome	MS	BACKGROUND: The role of laparoscopic procedures in the treatment of Mirizzi syndrome (MS) is not well-defined and remains controversial. We evaluated the preoperative diagnosis and efficacy of laparoscopic procedures in treatment of MS. STUDY DESIGN: Preoperative diagnosis and cholecystectomy were attempted on 2,012 consecutive patients at a single center and 24 (1.2%) were finally diagnosed with MS. Patients without preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography underwent preoperative spiral CT after IV infusion cholangiography (IVC-SCT). RESULTS: Fourteen patients had McSherry type I MS (MS I) and 10 had type II MS (MS II). Open operation was performed on patients with MS II or a preoperative suspicion of gallbladder cancer. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was performed successfully on 10 of 14 patients with MS I and the remaining 4 patients with MS I were converted to open procedure. At preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (n = 3) or IVC-SCT (n = 11) on patients with MS I, 3 of 4 (75%) patients who were converted to open operation had a nonvisualized cystic duct, and 9 of 10 (90%) patients with LC had a visualized cystic duct. CONCLUSIONS: MS I with a visualized cystic duct can be considered to be an indication for laparoscopic operation. IVC-SCT can be a useful tool for correct preoperative diagnosis and assessment of the feasibility of LC in patients with MS I.

hepatocyte nuclear factor 4	HNF-4	We identified a human hypoxic signal transduction pathway acting through a signature motif in the carboxyl terminal of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), by functional comparison of the transcriptional and protein-protein interaction activities of the wild type and mutants. It was previously shown that HNF-4 functions as a tissue-specific and hypoxia-activated transcription factor for the erythropoietin (Epo) gene. Human HNF-4 (465 amino acid residues) has DNA-binding, ligand-binding, and transactivation domains. The deletion mutant without the carboxyl terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 369-465) has been shown to be a dominant-negative mutant that repressed Epo transcriptional activity in hypoxia. Further characterization of the hypoxia-responsive domain by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a TKQE motif of the carboxyl terminal (amino acids 460-463) in HNF-4 was essential for hypoxia-inducible Epo gene expression. We also found, by means of immunoprecipitation and a mammalian two-hybrid system, direct interactions between HNF-4 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits. HNF-4 was observed to interact with HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta (arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, ARNT) during hypoxia. In addition, the TKQE motif of HNF-4 was essential for protein-protein interactions with HIF-1alpha and ARNT. These results indicate that the human hypoxic signal of HIF-1 is transduced through interactions with the signature TKQE motif of the carboxyl terminal of HNF-4, resulting in Epo gene expression as a response to hypoxia.

sucrose permeability-surface area product	PA	Using an in situ perfusion technique, we measured the [14C]sucrose permeability-surface area product (PA) in endoneurial capillaries of 48 frog sciatic nerves, as 6.6 +/- 0.6 (S.E.M.) X 10(-5) s-1, and the vascular space as 1.31 +/- 0.10%. Assuming A = 30 cm2/g, P = 2.2 X 10(-6) cm/s. P for sucrose was greater than P in some barrier tissues with tight junctions, but was less than P in all capillaries examined so far except rat cerebral capillaries. These observations demonstrate that endoneurial capillaries are an effective part of the blood-nerve barrier to water-soluble non-electrolytes. The findings are consistent with capillary impermeability to microperoxidase and with capillary ultrastructure.
tick-borne encephalitis	TBE	Detection of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in Liechtenstein.
tick-borne encephalitis	TBE	In this study, we present the first detection of a focus of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus-infected ticks in Liechtenstein. The focus is located on a much-used forest path near Vaduz, the capital of the principality. The virus isolated is a representative of the Western subtype of the TBE virus. It is thus closely related to or identical with the other strains isolated in western Europe.
Fuji Computed Radiography	FCR	A 33-year-old female was evaluated for abnormality of her chest roentgenogram which showed diffuse fine granular micronodulation in the lower two thirds of both lung fields. The bone image (soft tissue cancelled image) of dual-energy subtraction radiography obtained with Fuji Computed Radiography (FCR) demonstrated that the abnormal shadows were characterized by calcified deposits.
fluoxetine	FLU	A selective and sensitive liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of fluoxetine (FLU) in plasma. FLU was isolated from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was performed on an analytical 250 x 3.9 mm id Novapak C18 column (4 microm particle size) with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer-acetonitrile-methanol -triethylamine (58 + 30 + 10 + 2, v/v) adjusted to pH 7. Using UV detection at 226 nm, the detection limit for FLU in plasma was 3 ng/mL. No interferences were found with tricyclic antidepressant drugs, which allows this method to be used in clinical studies. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range of 10-200 ng/mL. The average recovery was about 80% for plasma. The inter- and intraday assay coefficients of variation were <8%.
magnetic resonance imaging	MRI	Sixty consecutive patients were staged clinically by digital rectal examination, acid phosphatase and bone scan prior to radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Twenty-one patients also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvic. The surgical specimens were step-sectioned for pathologic staging. Understaging was documented in 0% of A2 patients, 27% of B1 patients and 67% of B2 patients. Capsular invasion was found in 12% of B1 and 52% of B2 patients, while seminal vesicle extension was documented in 18% of B1 and 52% of B2 patients. Lymph node metastases occurred in 3% of B1 and 29% of B2 patients. Clinical staging error was related to tumor size, tumor grade and history of prior TURP or radiotherapy. Neither CT scan nor MRI improved the accuracy of the digital rectal examination.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	HCM	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common primary cardiac disorder with an increased risk of sudden death, affects all population groups in South Africa. Distinct causal mutations in multiple sarcomeric protein-encoding genes correlate with the risk of sudden death. Such genotype/phenotype correlations cannot be extrapolated geographically or ethnically, necessitating the generation of South African-specific data. We used DNA-based techniques to search for the causal mutations in a panel of South African HCM-affected subjects (37 with unequivocal HCM, 47 with HCM-like disease). Mutations detected were traced in family members and carriers assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiography. Nine different HCM-causing mutations (5 unique to South Africa, 3 showing a founder effect) were identified in 3 genes in 24 index cases (57% HCM group, 6% HCM-like group). The different mutations were associated with variable hypertrophy, independent of the risk of sudden death. The disease was generally familial and many at-risk mutation carriers did not meet clinical diagnostic criteria for HCM. Rigorous diagnosis of index cases facilitates detection of causal mutations, which allows for unequivocal DNA-based diagnosis of at-risk family members, regardless of age or clinical status. This permits focused patient management, informed prognostication and realistic counselling for this insidious disease, as well as time and cost savings.
Cancer Prevention Study	CPS	Several studies have found an inverse relationship between parity and risk of pancreatic cancer. However, most of the studies of pancreatic cancer in relation to parity and other reproductive factors have been small and the results inconsistent. Most recently, a well-conducted, prospective cohort study found a linear inverse association between parity and pancreatic cancer. To clarify the relationship between parity and other reproductive factors and risk of pancreatic mortality, we examined these associations among 387,981 postmenopausal U.S. women in the Cancer Prevention Study (CPS)-II cohort. CPS-II participants completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1982 and were followed for mortality through 2000. During follow-up, 1959 pancreatic cancer deaths occurred. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, we calculated rate ratios (RR) adjusted for age, race, education, personal history of diabetes, body mass index, height, exercise, family history of pancreatic cancer, and cigarette smoking status, frequency, and duration. Overall, we did not observe a significant association between parity and pancreatic cancer mortality (trend p = 0.07). However, women who had five or more births had lower death rates from pancreatic cancer than nulliparous women (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96). We observed no association between any other reproductive factors examined (age at first birth, menarche, or menopause; type of menopause; diethylstilbestrol (DES) use; or duration of oral contraceptive or estrogen replacement therapy use) and pancreatic cancer mortality. In summary, our results support the observation that high parity is associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer but do not show a linear trend with increasing parity. Furthermore, we find no evidence that other reproductive factors are associated with pancreatic cancer mortality.

Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, we calculated rate ratios (RR) adjusted for age, race, education, personal history of diabetes, body mass index, height, exercise, family history of pancreatic cancer, and cigarette smoking status, frequency, and duration. Overall, we did not observe a significant association between parity and pancreatic cancer mortality (trend p = 0.07). However, women who had five or more births had lower death rates from pancreatic cancer than nulliparous women (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96). We observed no association between any other reproductive factors examined (age at first birth, menarche, or menopause; type of menopause; diethylstilbestrol (DES) use; or duration of oral contraceptive or estrogen replacement therapy use) and pancreatic cancer mortality. In summary, our results support the observation that high parity is associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer but do not show a linear trend with increasing parity. Furthermore, we find no evidence that other reproductive factors are associated with pancreatic cancer mortality.
diethylstilbestrol	DES	Several studies have found an inverse relationship between parity and risk of pancreatic cancer. However, most of the studies of pancreatic cancer in relation to parity and other reproductive factors have been small and the results inconsistent. Most recently, a well-conducted, prospective cohort study found a linear inverse association between parity and pancreatic cancer. To clarify the relationship between parity and other reproductive factors and risk of pancreatic mortality, we examined these associations among 387,981 postmenopausal U.S. women in the Cancer Prevention Study (CPS)-II cohort.

cimetidine	CM	An in vivo micronucleus assay using Balb/C male mice was used to examine antigenotoxic effects of cimetidine (CM) on benzene (BZN) induced genotoxic effects. CM not only has therapeutic and immunomudolatory role, but it has also been shown to protect bone marrow stem cells from radiation induced clastogenic effects. Therefore, in the present study we attempt to investigate the protective effects and possible mechanisms involved in the effects of CM. An 8-week-old male Balb/C mice (22+/-4 g weight) were treated with different doses of BZN (400, 600 and 800 mg/kg body weight), i.p. and sampled at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment by cervical dislocation. Various doses of CM (10, 15, 30 mg/kg) were used in association with BZN and 1-2 h prior to BZN treatment. Results show that BZN effectively induced micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs). Application of CM led to a significant reduction of micronuclei in PCEs, i.e. 2-fold after 10 mg/kg and 3-fold after 30 mg/kg CM treatment. Results also indicate CM was more effective when used in combination with BZN. Therefore, results indicate that CM could reduce clastogenic effects of BZN. Although further investigations are needed to reveal the mechanistical background behind the effect, the most probable mechanism involved might be free radical scavenging. This mechanism might be associated with amplification of glutathione system and cytochrome P-450 inhibition.

polycystic ovarian syndrome	PCOS	To investigate the relationship between elevated LH, hyperinsulinemia and neuropeptides in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), we measured the endogenous levels of insulin, somatostatin (SS), beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and dynorphin A (Dyn A) before and after a glucose load in three groups: group 1 (LH/ FSH > or = 3, n = 30); group 2 (LH/FSH < 3, n = 25), and controls (n = 15). In the basal state, significantly negative correlations were found between LH and SS (r = -0.51, p < 0.05) in group 1 and between LH and beta-EP (r = -0.49, p < 0.05) in group 2. After a glucose load, PCOS women had greater beta-EP and Dyn A responses in group 1 and impaired SS response in group 2 as compared with the control. The data suggest endogenously lower SS, higher beta-EP and Dyn A may contribute to the elevation of LH and insulin secretions in PCOS.

3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA	HMG-CoA	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme and the first committed step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol in mammals. We have determined the crystal structures of two nonproductive ternary complexes of HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA/NAD+ and mevalonate/NADH, at 2.8 A resolution. In the structure of the Pseudomonas mevalonii apoenzyme, the last 50 residues of the C terminus (the flap domain), including the catalytic residue His381, were not visible. The structures of the ternary complexes reported here reveal a substrate-induced closing of the flap domain that completes the active site and aligns the catalytic histidine proximal to the thioester of HMG-CoA. The structures also present evidence that Lys267 is critically involved in catalysis and provide insights into the catalytic mechanism.
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia	PIN	High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is the most likely precursor of prostatic carcinoma. PIN has a high predictive value as a marker for carcinoma, and its identification in biopsy specimens warrants repeat biopsy for concurrent or subsequent carcinoma. The only methods of detection are biopsy and transurethral resection; PIN does not significantly elevate serum PSA concentration or its derivatives, nor does it induce a palpable mass, and cannot be detected by ultrasound. Androgen deprivation therapy decreases the prevalence and extent of PIN, suggesting that this form of treatment may play a role in chemoprevention. Radiation therapy is also associated with a decreased incidence of PIN.
single nucleotide polymorphisms	SNPs	BACKGROUND: Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can serve as gene markers, polymorphism profiles may help scientists to identify the full collection of genes that contribute to the development of complex diseases such as cancer. The distribution of interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter polymorphisms in Chinese Han ethnic patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in this study. METHODS: The polymorphisms of IL-10 promoter region were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. Sixty-six health controls, 42 patients with HBV infection, 30 HCC patients, and cell line SMMC-7721 were examined this way. RESULTS: Polymorphisms of T/C or T/N on -872 site occurred frequently in Han ethnic population. Polymorphisms were detected in HBV and HCC patients and cell line SMMC-7721. The hotspot among the polymorphisms was inserting base A between -1058 and -1057. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of IL-10 promoter in HBV and HCC patients may be associated with HBV infection and HCC development.

parasitized red blood cells	pRBCs	Opsonin-independent macrophage phagocytosis was investigated as a possible mechanism of controlling early blood-stage Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection. Early during infection, peritoneal macrophages from resistant C57BL/6 (B6) mice exhibited increased phagocytosis of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) and free merozoites, which was absent in mice with deficient interferon (IFN)-gamma production during infection, including susceptible A/J, interleukin (IL)-12 p40, and IFN-gamma gene knockout mice. IFN-gamma treatment of macrophages collected from B6 and A/J mice early during infection enhanced phagocytosis of pRBCs, but IL-10 treatment inhibited this function. In vitro and in vivo studies in which type I and II class A scavenger receptor-deficient mice and inhibitors of scavenger and mannose receptors were used revealed that scavenger receptors other than class A type I and II and mannose receptors may play a role in malaria parasite uptake. These results indicate that opsonin-independent phagocytosis contributes to the IFN-gamma-dependent control of acute blood-stage malaria infection.

(multiplicity of infection).	M.O.I.	This study reports the successful growth suppression of a rat glioblastoma model (RT-2) both in vitro and in vivo by the insertion of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a negative cell cycle regulatory gene, into the tumor cells. Greater than 95% of the tumor cells expressed p21 protein after being infected with pCL based p21 retrovirus at 4x M.O.I. (multiplicity of infection). The p21-infected cells showed a 91% reduction in colony forming efficiency and a 66% reduction in growth rate. More prominent p21 staining was found in cells exhibiting histologic evidence of senescence. Intracranial implantation of the infected cells showed complete disappearance of the p21-infected cells at day 10 and long-term survival of the animals compared to controls. Injection of pCLp21 virus into tumor established in situ showed tumor necrosis and gene expression. In a clonogenic radiation survival assay, a 93% reduction of surviving colonies of p21-infected cells was seen in comparison to vector-infected control cells and to p53-infected cells after exposure to 8 Gy (800 rads).
nitric oxide synthase	NOS	The cerebral microcirculation undergoes specific biochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have compared the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity of brain microvessels isolated from Alzheimer and control brains. L-[3H]-citrulline, the stable co-product generated with nitric oxide (NO) from L-[3H]-arginine, was measured as an indicator of NOS activity. The results indicated a significant increase in NOS activity in microvessels isolated from Alzheimer brains. In addition, using antibodies to both the endothelial and inducible NOS isoforms, we demonstrated a significant increase in enzyme level in Alzheimer-derived vessels. Elevated vascular production of NO, a potentially neurotoxic mediator in the CNS, may contribute to the susceptibility of neurons to injury and cell death in Alzheimer's disease.

non-heart-beating donors	NHBD	BACKGROUND: In lung transplantation using non-heart-beating donors (NHBD), the postmortem period of warm ischemia exacerbates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (NO) would reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, and thus ameliorate the viability of the lung graft. METHODS: A blood-perfused, isolated rat lung model was used. Lungs were flushed and harvested from non-heart-beating donors after 30 minutes of in situ warm ischemia. The lung was then stored for 2 hours at 4 degrees C. Inhaled NO at 30 ppm was given either during the period of warm ischemia, during reperfusion, or during both periods. Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury was assessed after 1 hour of reperfusion by measuring pulmonary vascular resistance, coefficient of filtration, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, and myeloperoxidase activity. RESULTS: A severe IR injury occurred in lungs undergoing ischemia and reperfusion without NO as evidenced by high values of pulmonary vascular resistance (6.83 +/- 0.36 mm Hg. mL-1.min-1), coefficient of filtration (3.02 +/- 0.35 mL.min-1.cm H2O-1 x 100 g-1), and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (8.07 +/- 0.45). Lower values (respectively, 3.31 +/- 0.44 mm Hg.mL-1.min-1, 1.49 +/- 0.34 mL.min-1.cm H2O-1 x 100 g-1, and 7.44 +/- 0.43) were observed when lungs were ventilated with NO during ischemia. Lung function was further improved when NO was given during reperfusion only. All measured variables, including myeloperoxidase activity were significantly improved when NO was given during both ischemia and reperfusion. Myeloperoxidase activity was significantly correlated with coefficient of filtration (r = 0.465; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inhaled NO significantly reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury in lungs harvested from non-heart-beating donors. This effect might be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil sequestration in the reperfused lung.

quality of life	QOL	STUDY DESIGN: Review. OBJECTIVES: To explore the concept of quality of life (QOL), critique the practice and problems of assessing QOL following spinal cord injury (SCI) and to review the findings of studies into QOL for people with SCI both below and above the level of C4. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified from the Medline and CINAHL databases for approximately the period 1990-2003, cross-indexing 'spinal cord injury' or 'quadriplegia/tetraplegia' with 'quality of life', 'life satisfaction', 'social adjustment' or 'psychological adaptation'. This search was augmented through papers identified in reference lists. Articles were excluded if they were designed solely to examine the impact of a specific intervention upon QOL; or if they examined satisfaction with various life domains without explicitly linking these to perceptions of QOL. Papers were also accessed that addressed the philosophical and epistemological issues involved in QOL conceptions and assessment. RESULTS: Review of the literature highlights the philosophical and methodological difficulties associated with the quantitative measurement of a qualitative experience; and with the assessment of life domains chosen by researchers. Analysis of QOL research undertaken among people with all levels of SCI demonstrates that dissatisfaction with life following injury arises primarily from social disadvantage. However, little research has been conducted specifically to ascertain perceptions of QOL among people with high SCI. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring the relevance of future research into QOL following high SCI requires qualitative methodology and mixed methods. Further research is needed to determine how rehabilitation professionals can act on the findings of their QOL assessments and enhance the QOL experienced by people with spinal cord injury in the context of their environments. SPONSORSHIP: The early phase of this study was supported by: University of British Columbia Graduate Fellowship; Rick Hansen Man in Motion Foundation (studentship); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: doctoral fellowship.

ethylene diamine dihydrochloride	NEDC	A procedure has been developed for the automated measurement of conjugated bilirubin in serum with a centrifugal analyzer. The conjugated bilirubin is measured by a fixed time kinetic method which monitors the reaction between conjugated bilirubin and diazotized sulfanilic acid at 550 nm. Results are calculated based on a comparison of the reagent blank-corrected absorbance changes between 15 seconds and 75 seconds for sample vs changes in an empirical standard. The standard used is N-(1-naphthyl) ethylene diamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) which reacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid at a rate comparable to conjugated bilirubin. The standard is calibrated by comparison with a modified Jendrassik and Grof procedure using a serum blank-corrected centrifugal analyzer reference method. The method is linear to 150 mg per 1 with a sensitivity of 3.0 milliabsorbance units per 1.0 mg per 1 of conjugated bilirubin using a 35 mul sample volume. Within-run precision is 1 percent for elevated concentrations of bilirubin. Hemolysis introduces a negative interference, the nature of which is discussed.
small-cell lung cancer	SCLC	The treatment of choice for limited small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is platinum-based chemotherapy combined with early, concurrent thoracic radiotherapy with a hyperfractionated regimen. The standard chemotherapy for extensive SCLC in Japan is the combination of irinotecan and cisplatin. There are expectations for new and effective molecular-target-based drugs for SCLC.
homologous recombination repair	HRR	The role of homologous recombination processes in the repair of severe forms of DNA damage is reviewed, with particular attention to the functions of members of the recA/RAD51 family of genes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several of the gene products involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR) have been studied in detail, and a picture is beginning to emerge of the repair mechanism for DNA double-strand breaks. Knowledge is fragmentary for other eukaryotic organisms and for other types of DNA damage. In mammalian cells, while it has been known for some years that HRR occurs, the relative importance of the process in repairing DNA damage is unknown and very few of the gene products involved have been identified. Very recently, a number of RAD51-like genes have been identified in mammals, either through cloning genes complementing cell lines sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (XRCC2, XRCC3), or through homology searches (RAD51L1, RAD51L2, RAD51L3). As yet the role of these genes and their possible functions are speculative, although the combination of sequence conservation and gene expression patterns suggest that they function in HRR pathways.
Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer	MASCC	BACKGROUND: Oral-based antibiotic therapy is the standard of care in the management of cancer patients with low-risk neutropenic fever. Nevertheless, to the authors' knowledge, the best antibiotic regimen and the feasibility of ambulatory treatment have not been clearly defined. METHODS: The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin as outpatient treatment in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia who were selected according to the recently proposed Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk assessment model. Moxifloxacin was given at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients with solid and hematologic malignancies, the majority of whom (84%) had advanced disease, were included in the current study. The median neutrophil count at the time of study entry was 340/mm3 (range, 20-950/mm3) and the median duration of neutropenia was 4 days (range, 3-14 days). Of 55 neutropenic episodes, 50 (91%) had a successful outcome with a median time to defervescence of 2 days (range, 1-5 days). A multivariate analysis indicated that severe neutropenia (an absolute neutrophil count of < 100 mm3) was the only independent factor associated with treatment failure (P < 0.04). Moxifloxacin was found to be well tolerated and there were no infectious deaths reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that moxifloxacin was a highly effective and safe regimen in the outpatient treatment of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.
headspace solid-phase microextraction	SPME	A new solvent-free analytical procedure based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography employing an electron capture detector (GC/ECD) or alternatively a mass spectrometric detector (GC/MSD) has been developed for the determination of phthalic acid esters (dimethyl-[DMP], diethyl-[DEP], di-n-butyl-[DnBP], butylbenzyl-[BBP], di-2-ethylhexyl-[DEHP] and di-n-octyl [DnOP] phthalate) in vegetable oils. Four different fiber coatings were evaluated, among them polydimethylsiloxane with a thickness of 100 microm appeared to be the best choice for allowing extraction of the whole group of analytes. Various solvents were tested as sample matrix modification agents with the aim to facilitate the transfer of esters with low vapour pressure (DEHP and DnOP) from oil matrix into the headspace. The addition of methanol resulted in optimal set-up applicable for all phthalate esters. Temperature control and the way of sample stirring were recognized as critical points of the whole procedure. Primarily, because shaking rather than stirring of the sample is carried out using a CombiPal multipurpose sampler, the automation of the SPME method employing this instrument was found to be not fully suitable for efficient stripping of phthalates from the oil matrix into the sample headspace. Nevertheless, the optimized manual SPME method, encompassing GC/ECD or GC/MSD for the separation and detection of target analytes, offers a unique solution and showed acceptable performance characteristics: linear response in the range of 0.5-2 mg kg(-1) and repeatability expressed as R.S.D. between 14 and 23% at the spiking level of 2 mg kg(-1).

relative humidity	RH	We examined the evolutionary response of wing area (a trait highly correlated with other measures of body size) to relative humidity (RH), temperature, and their interaction in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines that had been allowed to evolve at low or high humidity at 18 degrees C or at 25 degrees C. We found that after 20 weeks of selection (5-10 generations), low RH lines had significantly greater wing areas than high RH lines in both sexes. This evolutionary response may have resulted from selection of larger flies with a smaller surface area for water loss relative to their weight, or as a correlated response to selection on some other unidentified trait. There were no evolutionary effects of temperature on wing area or cell density. This may have been due to the short duration of the selection experiment, and/or counteracting selection pressures on body size at warm temperature.
Tight skin	TSK	Tight skin (TSK) mouse skin has previously been shown to contain increased amounts of collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). We now report on the GAG composition of TSK mouse skin. Using an electrophoretic and an enzymatic HPLC method, skin from 99 TSK and control mice (newborn, 1 month-old, and 6 months-old) were analyzed for GAG composition. There was no significant difference between TSK and control GAG.

elongation factor G	EF-G	A key event in ribosomal protein synthesis is the translocation of deacylated tRNA, peptidyl tRNA and mRNA, which is catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G) and requires GTP. To address the molecular mechanism of the reaction we have studied the functional role of a tRNA exit site (E site) for tRNA release during translocation. We show that modifications of the 3' end of tRNAPhe, which considerably decrease the affinity of E-site binding, lower the translocation rate up to 40-fold. Furthermore, 3'-end modifications lower or abolish the stimulation by P site-bound tRNA of the GTPase activity of EF-G on the ribosome. The results suggest that a hydrogen-bonding interaction of the 3'-terminal adenine of the leaving tRNA in the E site, most likely base-pairing with 23S rRNA, is essential for the translocation reaction. Furthermore, this interaction stimulates the GTP hydrolyzing activity of EF-G on the ribosome. We propose the following molecular model of translocation: after the binding of EF-G.GTP, the P site-bound tRNA, by a movement of the 3'-terminal single-stranded ACCA tail, establishes an interaction with 23S rRNA in the adjacent E site, thereby initiating the tRNA transfer from the P site to the E site and promoting GTP hydrolysis. The co-operative interaction between the E site and the EF-G binding site, which are distantly located on the 50S ribosomal subunit, is probably mediated by a conformational change of 23S rRNA.

nitrogen	N	The purpose of this investigation was 1) to determine the apparent and true digestibilities in mice of nitrogen (N) and amino acids (AA) in commercially refined protein sources, and 2) to estimate metabolic fecal nitrogen (MFN) excretion. Each protein source was fed to adult female mice at 15 and 30% of a purified diet. A protein-free diet was included. Nutrient digestibility was determined by a fecal balance method with chromic oxide as a marker. Apparent digestibility of N in each protein source reflected the dietary N concentration and AA digestibility showed a similar trend. True digestibility (TD) of N was 97-98% for Animal Nutrition Research Council reference protein, casein, gelatin and gliadin, 94-96% for lactalbumin and soy protein and 81% for zein. TD of AA generally reflected TD of N. MFN excretion (g/100 g dry matter consumed) was 0.146 when the protein-free diet was fed and 0.151 by extrapolation to zero N intake. It was concluded that when commercially refined proteins are fed to mice, MFN excretion can be determined by either method, but this may not apply when the protein source contains antinutritive substances.

Short interfering RNA	siRNA	Short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules with good gene-silencing properties are needed for drug development based on RNA interference (RNAi). An initial step in RNAi is the activation of the RNA-induced silencing complex RISC, which requires degradation of the sense strand of the siRNA duplex. Although various chemical modifications have been introduced to the antisense strand, modifications to the Argonaute2 (Ago2) cleavage site in the sense strand have, so far, not been described in detail.In this work, novel 2'-F-purine modifications were introduced to siRNAs, and their biological efficacies were tested in cells stably expressing human tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP). A validated siRNA that contains both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides at the putative Ago2 cleavage site was chemically modified to contain all possible combinations of 2'-fluorinated 2'-deoxypurines and/or 2'-deoxypyrimidines in the antisense and/or sense strands. The capacity of 2'-F-modified siRNAs to knock down their target mRNA and protein was studied, together with monitoring siRNA toxicity. All 2'-F-modified siRNAs resulted in target knockdown at nanomolar concentrations, despite their high thermal stability. These experiments provide the first evidence that RISC activation not only allows 2'-F modifications at the sense-strand cleavage site, but also increase the biological efficacy of modified siRNAs in vitro.

endothelial cells	ECs	Completely biological tissue-engineered vascular graft is an upcoming substitute for damaged blood vessel, but its clinical use is currently limited due to poor mechanical strength. Therefore, at present, polymeric small-diameter vascular grafts lined with endothelial cells (ECs) to reduce graft thrombosis may be a more viable option. Successful construction of EC-seeded artificial grafts faces some challenges such as (i) retention of endothelial lining; and (ii) availability of differentiated autologous cells. Biomaterial surfaces that are modified by depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) components may stabilize cells in the lumen against forces of blood flow. Adult stem cells such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) circulate in the blood and they usually attach to the exposed matrix at the injured blood vessel site. Depending on the signaling capabilities of ECM, cells may differentiate into ECs,, and if a similar composition of the matrix is provided in vitro, EPCs isolated from blood might get differentiated and thus autologous cells for tissue engineering may be obtained. In this in vitro study, ECM scaffold consisting of biomolecules such as fibrin, fibronectin, and gelatin along with growth factors is found to have supported differentiation of EPC into EC. Further, the ECM precoated on Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene is found to have supported the formation of EC monolayer that synthesized nitric oxide, and resisted shear stress. Thus, biomimetic fibrin composite is found to be suitable not only to seed cells on currently available artificial grafts but also to obtain differentiated EC from EPC.

captive health maintenance	HMO	OBJECTIVE: To assess early patient dropout rates during infertility treatment as a potential measure of wasted resources. METHODS: The study involved multifaceted population cohorts, including a prospectively observed captive health maintenance organization (HMO) population and retrospectively selected preferred provider organization (PPO) patients. One hundred twenty-eight HMO couples were followed prospectively for 6 months. The insurance carrier retroactively selected 96 couples from their PPO population who were believed to be infertility patients. They were matched by date, age, and time of hysterosalpingography to infertility patients in the carrier's HMO population. Patients were considered treatment dropouts if they either requested their provider to abandon further work-up or treatment, or if they failed to return for an appointment for 3 months. RESULTS: Forty-six of 128 (36%) HMO patients followed prospectively discontinued care within 180 days, with only eight (6.3%) providing defined reasons. Preferred provider organization patients uniformly demonstrated significantly higher dropout rates than HMO patients, a finding already apparent at 60 days (P < .002; odds ratio [OR] 3.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47-9.97) and 120 days of treatment (P = .002; OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.39-6.06). Among PPO patients, dropout rates were especially pronounced if infertility care was provided by generalists. At billing levels of at least $2000, HMO patients also demonstrated less dropout than PPO patients (P < .001; OR 6.14, 95% CI 2.72-14.79), with generalists again demonstrating a significantly larger patient loss than infertility specialists (P < .001; OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.66-0.49). CONCLUSION: Infertility patients demonstrate a surprisingly large early dropout rate, which is significantly larger if patients receive infertility care from generalists rather than specialists. Newly presenting infertility patients should be carefully evaluated, especially in indemnity situations, before expensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are ordered.

mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells	PBPCs	The recent observation that mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) can be used as a source of hematopoietic support has had a major effect on the cost and morbidity associated with bone marrow transplantation in patients with breast cancer. The pharmacoeconomic impact of this new technology is especially evident when secondary costs are analyzed. We see a reduction in hospital stay, decreased use of resources such as platelet transfusions and antibiotics, and long-term quality life-years gained for those patients benefiting from this therapy. Experienced transplant centers have found that the direct cost of high-dose chemotherapy using filgrastim and PBPC support is reduced as much as 50% to the patient or their insurance company. Pharmacists will play a key role in optimizing the benefits of PBPC transplantation, particularly because this therapy is moving to the outpatient arena. This article will review the pharmacoeconomic impact of PBPC transplantation primarily in terms of secondary cost measures and quality of life and discuss the limited direct cost data available and the impact of this therapy on pharmacy practice.

Streptococcus Pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is one of the most important bacteria in tonsillitis and pharyngitis. The mode of the adherence of S. pyogenes to pharyngeal epithelial cells and the morphology of S. pyogenes were observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The adherence of S pyogenes to pharyngeal epithelial cells was mediated by the fimbriae radiating from the surface of the bacteria. The M protein-negative (M-) strain had smooth, bare cell walls, whereas the M protein-positive (M+) strain had an exterior covered by hair-like fimbriae.

regular dialytic treatment	R.D.T.	The plasma kinetics of some antibiotics (pivampicillin, cephaloridine, streptomycin) has been studied in patients with chronic renal failure. The oral administration of pivampicllin promptly increases the plasma levels of the antibiotic, without any toxic side effect: this antibiotic is to be chosen in chronic uremic patients, also during regular dialytic treatment (R.D.T.). Cephaloridine has some renal toxic effects in high concentration; in the renal failure it is advisable to calculate the exact dose of the antibiotic by the use of nomograms when the creatinine clearance is known. These nomograms must absolutely be employed when administrating some toxic antibiotics, as gentamycin and streptomycin in chronic uremic patients. Some formulas have been experimentally determined, which allow a calculation of the exact dose of the antibiotic, also during R.D.T. If a kidney or urinary tract infection is present in patients with low G.F.R. (creatinine-clearance less than 30 ml/min.), it is necessary to administer only those antibiotics which can reach an active urinary concentration (i.e. penicillin and derivatives, cephaloridine).
rat/human CRF	r/hCRF	Two CRF receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2, have recently been cloned and characterized. CRFR1 shares 70% sequence identity with CRFR2, yet has much higher affinity for rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) than CRFR2. As a first step toward understanding the interactions between rat/human CRF and its receptor, the regions that are involved in receptor-ligand binding and/or receptor activation were determined by using chimeric receptor constructs of the two human CRFR subtypes, CRFR1 and CRFR2, followed by generating point mutations of the receptor. The EC50 values in stimulation of intracellular cAMP of the chimeric and mutant receptors for the peptide ligand were determined using a cAMP-dependent reporter system. Three regions of the receptor were found to be important for optimal binding of r/hCRF and/or receptor activation. The first region was mapped to the junction of the third extracellular domain and the fifth transmembrane domain; substitution of three amino acids of CRFR1 in this region (Val266, Tyr267, and Thr268) by the corresponding CRFR2 amino acids (Asp266, Leu267, and Val268) increased the EC50 value by approximately 10-fold. The other two regions were localized to the second extracellular domain of the CRFR1 involving amino acids 175-178 and His189 residue. Substitutions in these two regions each increased the EC50 value for r/hCRF by approximately 7- to 8-fold only in the presence of the amino acid 266-268 mutation involving the first region, suggesting that their roles in peptide ligand binding might be secondary.
bluetongue virus	BTV	After the incursion of bluetongue virus (BTV) into European Mediterranean countries in 1998, vaccination was used in an effort to minimize direct economic losses to animal production, reduce virus circulation and allow safe movements of animals from endemic areas. Vaccination strategies in different countries were developed according to their individual policies, the geographic distribution of the incurring serotypes of BTV and the availability of appropriate vaccines. Four monovalent modified live virus (MLV) vaccines were imported from South Africa and subsequently used extensively in both cattle and sheep. MLVs were found to be immunogenic and capable of generating strong protective immunity in vaccinated ruminants. Adverse side effects were principally evident in sheep. Specifically, some vaccinated sheep developed signs of clinical bluetongue with fever, facial oedema and lameness. Lactating sheep that developed fever also had reduced milk production. More severe clinical signs occurred in large numbers of sheep that were vaccinated with vaccine combinations containing the BTV-16 MLV, and the use of the monovalent BTV-16 MLV was discontinued as a consequence. Abortion occurred in <0.5% of vaccinated animals. The length of viraemia in sheep and cattle that received MLVs did not exceed 35 days, with the single notable exception of a cow vaccinated with a multivalent BTV-2, -4, -9 and -16 vaccine in which viraemia persisted at least 78 days. Viraemia of sufficient titre to infect Culicoides insects was observed transiently in MLV-vaccinated ruminants, and natural transmission of MLV strains has been confirmed. An inactivated vaccine was first developed against BTV-2 and used in the field. An inactivated vaccine against BTV-4 as well as a bivalent vaccine against serotypes 2 and 4 were subsequently developed and used in Corsica, Spain, Portugal and Italy. These inactivated vaccines were generally safe although on few occasions reactions occurred at the site of inoculation. Two doses of these BTV inactivated vaccines provided complete, long-lasting immunity against both clinical signs and viraemia, whereas a single immunization with the BTV-4 inactivated vaccine gave only partial reduction of viraemia in vaccinated cattle when challenged with the homologous BTV serotype. Additional BTV inactivated vaccines are currently under development, as well as new generation vaccines including recombinant vaccines.

monoamine oxidase	MAO	A monoclonal antibody has been generated to human liver monoamine oxidase (MAO) B by fusion of mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with a mixture of semi-purified MAO A and MAO B. The antibody, 3F12/G10, an immunoglobulin G1, reacts with its antigen in cryostat sections of human liver, showing an intracellular particulate distribution as demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining. The antibody indirectly precipitates [3H]pargyline-labelled human MAO B both from liver and platelet extracts but fails to precipitate MAO A from liver extracts. The antibody does not recognise rat liver MAO B, showing that the determinant is not universally expressed on MAO B. The antibody has no effect on the catalytic activity of MAO B. Other monoclonal antibodies were generated but they are directed to a protein with a subunit Mr of 54 000, a contaminant of the MAO preparation. One of these antibodies, A8/C2, an IgG2a, reacts with the same protein in both rat and human liver extracts.
Ivanovas-Sieve colony	IVA-SIV	Sprague-Dawley male rats from the Ivanovas-Sieve colony (IVA-SIV) show higher plasma triglyceride levels compared to the standard Charles River (CR) rats. The triglyceride enrichment occurs primarily in the very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), otherwise of a normal % composition, suggesting that the number of particles is increased, rather than their triglyceride (TG) content. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, corresponding to HDL1, appear to be increased in the IVA-SIV rats, as confirmed by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation. The apoprotein composition of isolated lipoproteins (apo B content and isoelectric focusing pattern), does not differ in the two strains. The IVA-SIV rats are remarkably more TG inducible, compared to the standard CR. This can be shown with fructose loading and with a cholesterol-cholic acid diet. The plasma TG increase, after Triton administration, indicative of the VLDL-TG production, is fourfold higher in the IVA-SIV, compared to the CR rats. These findings provide evidence for some similarities between the IVA-SIV rat and human endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, and suggest an increased TG biosynthesis in this model.

continuous renal replacement therapy	CRRT	Both the choice of vascular access and anticoagulant regimen for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are a major determinant of not only circuit life span but also affect solute clearance. This evidence-based review critically examines the published rature on different vascular access sites, access types, and anticoagulation regimens, to provide clinical guidelines for good working practices and to direct future studies.
Perfadex	PER	BACKGROUND: Low-potassium-dextran preservation solution Perfadex (PER) may provide better outcome of transplanted lungs than high-potassium Euro-Collins (EC) solution. However, there are no comparative studies of the recipient inflammatory response to the graft. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare EC versus PER as preservation solutions with respect to the functional performance and inflammatory response in single-lung transplantation from heart-beating donors in pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The donor left lung flushed with the corresponding cold preservation solution was stored at 3 degrees C for 3 hours. We assessed hemodynamic values and pulmonary function in the recipient over a 2-hour reperfusion period calculated as percent of basal values, and expressed as mean of the reperfusion period. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentration in the donor was estimated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 2 hours after recipient reperfusion. Biopsies of the donor right lung and the transplanted lung were obtained to measure myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. IL-8 and MPO values were expressed as percent of the donor value. We evaluated the wet/dry pulmonary weight ratio (W/D), polymorphonuclear neutrophil count (PMN), and a score of histological damage in the transplanted graft. RESULTS: Pulmonary function evaluated by % static: 66.6 +/- 6.8 (EC), 82.3 +/- 10.2 (PER), and dynamic: 74.0 +/- 7.3 (EC), 89.3 +/- 7.7 (PER) compliances, as well as % IL-8: 562.5 +/- 168.6 (EC), 232.3 +/- 148.7 (PER), % MPO: 485.9 +/- 194.9 (EC), 140.8 +/- 21.1 (PER), W/D: 9.9 +/- 3.1 (EC), 6.8 +/- 1.4 (PER), PMN 13.5 +/- 6.8 (EC), 5.5 +/- 3.3 (PER) and the histological damage score: 3.0 +/- 1.5 (EC), 0.7 +/- 0.4 (PER) showed significant differences between the EC and the PER (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: PER affords good lung preservation with early graft function and modest evidences of inflammation, lung injury, and edema compared with the EC perfused lung.

fluorescent-antibody	FA	Jablon, J. M. (University of Miami, Miami, Fla.), and D. D. Zinner. Differentiation of cariogenic streptococci by fluorescent antibody. J. Bacteriol. 92:1590-1596. 1966.-Eight strains of streptococci were isolated from human carious lesions by the fluorescent-antibody (FA) technique. Seven of these strains produced experimental caries in hamsters or rats maintained on a high sucrose diet. The eighth strain was noncariogenic in animals but possessed some antigenic components in common with the cariogenic strains. On the basis of antigen-antibody reactions by microprecipitin and agar-gel diffusion patterns, the strains were divided into four groups; these groups differed with regard to their cariogenic activity in hamsters. Fluorescein-conjugated antisera, prepared against the human strains, showed some cross-reactions which interfered with the efficacy of the FA technique in differentiating between the related streptococcal groups. To eliminate these cross-reactions, a small amount of related-strain antisera was added to the fluorescein-conjugated antisera to the cariogenic strains. This technique is effective in blocking cross-reactions and should be tried wherever cross-reactions are encountered in the FA technique.
secundum atrial septal defects	ASD	OBJECTIVE: To discuss the initial experience with the use of a new double disc occluding device, the Amplatzer septal occluder in transcatheter occlusion of secundum atrial septal defects (ASD). METHODS: Transvenous sizing of secundum ASD was performed in five children under general anaesthesia using transoesophageal echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance. An Amplatzer septal occluder equal to or minimally larger than the stretched diameter of the ASD was used for transcatheter occlusion of the defect in three suitable patients. Pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty with a 18 mm x 3 cm Mansfield balloon catheter was carried out in one patient with associated pulmonary valvar stenosis in the same procedure setting. RESULTS: Stretched diameters of the defects in the three patients ranged from 14 to 17 mm. Devices of sizes 14, 17 and 17 were deployed through 7F and 8F sheaths, respectively. The upper and lower rims of interatrial septum were more than 8 mm in all patients. All patients had successful occlusion with complete obliteration of the atrial left to right shunting. Simultaneous pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty for the valvar stenosis reduced pressure gradient from 53 mmHg to 22 mmHg across the valve prior to septal occlusion in one patient. No intraprocedural or short-term complication was encountered. CONCLUSIONS: The design of the Amplatzer septal occluder permits ease in loading, delivery, deployment and stable seating of the device. This initial experience shows that Amplatzer device occlusion is feasible, relatively safe and effective and appears to be a viable alternative to surgical closure of secundum atrial septal defects in properly selected patients.
phospholipase A2	PLA2	The effects of snake venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) toxins (beta-bungarotoxin, notexin) and PLA2 enzymes (Naja nigricollis, Naja naja atra) on aminophospholipid asymmetry in rat cerebrocortical synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) were examined. Incubation of intact synaptosomes with 2 mM 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) for 40 min, under non-penetrating conditions, followed by SPM isolation, allowed us to calculate the percentage of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the SPM, while incubation with disrupted synaptosomes provided total labeling values with the difference representing labeling of the inner leaflet. We found that 30% of the PE and 2% of the PS were in the outer leaflet, with 54% of the PE and 80% of the PS in the inner leaflet; 16% of the PE and 18% of the PS was inaccessible to TNBS. PLA2 toxins and enzymes increased in a concentration-dependent manner the percentage of PS and, to a lesser extent, the percentage of PE in the outer leaflet of the SPM, due to a redistribution from the inner to the outer leaflet. There was no correlation between the PLA2 enzymatic activities and the increased percentage of PS in the outer leaflet of the SPM induced by the PLA2 toxins and enzymes. Alteration of aminophospholipid asymmetry does not explain the greater presynaptic specificity and potencies of the PLA2 toxins as compared to the PLA2 enzymes, but may be associated with the increased acetylcholine release from synaptosomes induced by both the toxins and enzymes.

2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid	TNBS	The effects of snake venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) toxins (beta-bungarotoxin, notexin) and PLA2 enzymes (Naja nigricollis, Naja naja atra) on aminophospholipid asymmetry in rat cerebrocortical synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) were examined. Incubation of intact synaptosomes with 2 mM 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) for 40 min, under non-penetrating conditions, followed by SPM isolation, allowed us to calculate the percentage of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the SPM, while incubation with disrupted synaptosomes provided total labeling values with the difference representing labeling of the inner leaflet. We found that 30% of the PE and 2% of the PS were in the outer leaflet, with 54% of the PE and 80% of the PS in the inner leaflet; 16% of the PE and 18% of the PS was inaccessible to TNBS. PLA2 toxins and enzymes increased in a concentration-dependent manner the percentage of PS and, to a lesser extent, the percentage of PE in the outer leaflet of the SPM, due to a redistribution from the inner to the outer leaflet.

relative risk	RR	The favourable effects of exogenous progestagen on the endometrium are well known, but have not been adequately quantified with respect to endometrial cancer. The benefits of progestagen need to be weighted against its possible untoward effects on the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. A population-based case-control study of endometrial cancer was undertaken to evaluate the benefits of progestagen use. 158 incident cases were identified between 1985 and 1987 among women aged 40-64 years who were residents of King County, Washington. Detailed interviews were conducted and the responses were compared with those of 182 controls selected by random telephone digit dialling. The risk of endometrial cancer among women who had used unopposed oestrogen for more than 3 years was over five times that of women who had used no hormones (relative risk [RR] 5.7, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 2.5-12.8), whereas those who had also used a progestagen for at least six months of that time had an RR of only 1.6 (95% Cl 0.6-3.9). The RR differed according to days per month that progestagen was used: 2.4 (0.6-9.3) for progestagen use of less than 10 days per month versus 1.1 (0.4-3.6) for use of 10 or more days per month. These results provide additional evidence that the use of progestagen for 10 or more days per cycle can reduce the excess risk of endometrial cancer associated with long-term postmenopausal oestrogen use.
childhood sexual abuse	CSA	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to describe patterns of forgetting and remembering childhood sexual abuse (CSA) in a nationally representative sample of US adult women. METHOD: The respondents were a national probability sample of 711 women, aged 26 years to 54 years, residing in noninstitutional settings in the contiguous 48 states. In a 1996 face-to-face interview survey, trained female interviewers asked each respondent whether she had experienced any sexual coercion by family members or nonfamily members while growing up; whether she believed that she had been sexually abused (by family members or others); and whether she had ever forgotten the CSA experiences and, if so, how she had subsequently remembered them. RESULTS: Twenty-one and six-tenths percent of respondents reported having sexually coercive experiences while growing up; of these, 69.0% indicated that they felt they had been sexually abused. More than one-fourth of respondents who felt sexually abused reported that they had forgotten the abuse for some period of time but later remembered it on their own. Only 1.8% of women self-described as sexually abused reported remembering the abuse with the help of a therapist or other professional person. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that, among women who report CSA, forgetting and subsequently remembering abuse experiences is not uncommon. According to the women surveyed, however, very few (1.8%) of those who felt abused recovered memories of CSA with help from therapists or other professionals. As one of the few studies of CSA memories in a nationally representative sample, this study suggests that therapist-assisted recall is not a major source of CSA memories among women in the US general population.
patent foramen ovale	PFO	A 38-year-old man with a history of migraine headaches with aura and one episode of ischemic stroke was found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO). After percutaneous closure with the nickel-containing Amplatzer PFO occluder, the patient developed pericarditis, atrial fibrillation, and increased migraine headaches with aura that abated with oral prednisone. He tested positive for nickel hypersensitivity, which we conclude is the likely etiology of his pericarditis.
parathyroid hormone-related protein	PTHrP	Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy may reflect the synthesis and secretion of biologically active parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by a given tumor. In the present study we investigated 25 human non-endocrine carcinomas which were clinically associated with hypercalcemia (Ca > 11 mg%). By applying PTHrP-specific immunocytochemistry, PTHrP could be detected in all tumors. The intra-tumorous distribution was heterogeneous with strong positivity in relatively few cells or weak positivity in the majority of cells. Surprisingly, in the PTHrP producing cells none of the marker proteins typical of endocrine cells (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 antigen, chromogranin, synaptophysin and endocrine granule constituent) was found. On the other hand, PTHrP producing cells of endocrine origin, such as medullary cancer, or normal and adenomatous parathyroid glands, all produce these endocrine markers. Thus for the first time, the existence of peptide hormone producing tumor cells is reported without expression of endocrine markers. This indicates a special mechanism of PTHrP secretion.
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices	IUDs	Hysterectomy specimens were obtained from ten adult female rhesus monkeys treated with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) for a period of three, six and twelve months. The effect of levonorgestrel on the endometria, ovaries and fallopian tubes of removed uteri was examined in luteal phase of cycle. A uniform suppression of endometrium with glandular atrophy and pseudodecidualization of stromal cells was observed in endometrial biopsies, whereas ovaries and tubal epithelium exhibited normal physiological changes as evidenced by presence of ovulatory stigma along with well formed corpus luteum and secretory activity of tubal epithelium.
human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	The immune dysfunction and cell destruction that occur in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected host appear to result from the direct cytopathic effects of viral infection and the effects of viral proteins on uninfected bystander cells. Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins. In the current study, it was observed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) undergo apoptosis after their treatment with the HIV-1 envelope proteins gp120/160. Anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody decreased HIV-1 gp120/160-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the CXCR4 chemokine receptor mediates the apoptotic effects of these HIV envelope glycoproteins. Further studies revealed that caspases play an important role in this process because the pretreatment of cells with a general caspase enzyme inhibitor decreased the extent of HUVEC apoptosis induced by gp120/160. In addition, it was found that caspase-3 was activated on HIV-1 gp120/160 treatment of these cells. It was also observed that gp120/160 treatment slightly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax. These results suggest that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins can disrupt endothelial integrity through the interaction with CXCR4, thereby facilitating virus transit out of the bloodstream and contributing to the vascular injury syndromes seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Mallory body	MB	Mallory body (MB) experimental induction takes 10 weeks of drug ingestion. Therefore, it is difficult to study the dynamics and mechanisms involved in vivo. Consequently, an in vitro study was done using primary tissue culture of hepatocytes from drug-primed mice livers in which MBs had already formed. The hypothesis to be tested was that MBs are cytokeratin aggresomes, which form when hepatocytes have a defective ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by which turnover of cytokeratin proteins is prevented. To test this hypothesis, primary tissue cultures of the hepatocytes from normal and MB-forming livers were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 and then the cytokeratin filaments and the filament connecting proteins, that is, beta-actin, and ZO1, were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. PS-341 caused detachment of the cytokeratins from the cell surface plasma membrane. The cytokeratin filaments retracted toward the nucleus and cytokeratin aggresomes formed. In human livers, MBs showed colocalization of cytokeratin-8 (CK-8) with ubiquitin but not with beta-actin or ZO1. Mouse hepatoma cell lines were studied using PS-341 to induce cytokeratin aggresome formation. In these cell lines, the cytokeratin filaments first retracted toward the nucleus then formed cytokeratin-ubiquitin aggresomes polarized at one side of the nucleus. At the same time, the cells became dissociated from each other, however. The results simulated MB formation. MBs differ from cytokeratin aggresomes both morphologically and in ultrastructure.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	COPD	Evidence supporting or refuting the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has only recently become available, and evidence is still missing for a number of important clinical issues. Results from four large studies on the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on COPD and other controlled studies on the more short-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids provide evidence that regular treatment with these drugs is only appropriate for a limited group of patients with COPD. These include symptomatic COPD patients with documented spirometric response to inhaled corticosteroids or those with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) less than 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations requiring treatments with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids.

Creola bodies	CrBs	Creola bodies (CrBs) have been shown to be present specifically in the sputum of adults with asthma, and are clinically useful in the estimation of airway hyper-responsiveness through correlation with the levels of eosinophil cationic protein in the sputum. Our aim was to investigate whether CrBs can be detected in the sputum of wheezing infants, and the clinical significance of CrBs in wheezing infants in the development of asthma. Twenty-three wheezing infant patients, mean age 5.3 months, were studied. The presence of CrBs in the sputum was determined by Papanicolau's stain. The patients were divided into two groups: CrB positive [CrB(+)] and CrB negative [CrB(-)]. In addition, we examined the relationship between the presence of CrBs and the asthma symptom scores that occurred during a 1-month post-discharge period. The following results were obtained: (i) CrBs were detected in 15 of 23 (65%) wheezing infants; (ii) the asthma symptom scores after discharge was significantly higher in the CrB(+) group than in the CrB(-) group (p < 0.001); (iii) in the infants experiencing their first episode of wheezing, the asthma symptom scores during the post-discharge period was also significantly higher in the CrB(+) group than in the CrB(-) group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, infantile asthma was diagnosed in 12 (80.0%) infants in the CrB(+) group during the following 2-yr period, but none in the CrB(-) group. These findings suggest that CrBs detected in the sputum of wheezing infants may be used to identify the progression to infantile asthma.

acute renal failure	ARF	It is well known that acute renal failure (ARF) after surgery has a high mortality rate. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the renal tubular damage following surgery. Urinary beta 2 microglobulin (u-BMG) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (u-NAG) activities, thought to be the sensitive indicators of renal tubular impairment, were measured in 48 patients treated surgically in our clinic. Three out of 48 patients developed ARF. Remaining 45 showed normal values in conventional renal function tests, while u-BMG and u-NAG revealed abnormally high levels in many cases. Bleeding amount during surgery, operative time, postoperative complications, especially circulatory shock, and preoperative hypotention were the factors which correlated closely to the elevation of u-BMG and u-NAG. Administration of urinastatin prevented the u-NAG elevation postoperatively, while it had no effect on u-BMG.

hemolytic uremic syndrome	HUS	Escherichia coli O157 infections are the cause of sporadic or epidemic cases of often bloody diarrhea that can progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a systematic microvascular syndrome with predominantly renal and neurological complications. HUS is responsible for most deaths associated with E. coli O157 infection. From March 2002 to February 2004, approximately 13,000 fecal pat samples from 481 farms with finishing/store cattle throughout Scotland were examined for the presence of E. coli O157. A total of 441 fecal pats from 91 farms tested positive for E. coli O157. From the positive samples, a point estimate for high-level shedders was identified using mixture distribution analysis on counts of E. coli O157. Models were developed based on the confidence interval surrounding this point estimate (high-level shedder, greater than 10(3) or greater than 10(4) CFU g(-1) feces). The mean prevalence on high-level-shedding farms was higher than that on low-level-shedding farms. The presence of a high-level shedder on a farm was found to be associated with a high proportion of low-level shedding, consistent with the possibility of a higher level of transmission. Analysis of risk factors associated with the presence of a high-level shedder on a farm suggested the importance of the pathogen and individual host rather than the farm environment. The proportion of high-level shedders of phage 21/28 was higher than expected by chance. Management-related risk factors that were identified included the type of cattle (female breeding cattle) and cattle stress (movement and weaning), as opposed to environmental factors, such as water supply and feed.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy	XAS	Electronic structural changes in LiTi(2)O(4) spinel compounds upon electrochemical lithium insertions were investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements and first principles calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory. Ti K-edge, O K-edge XAS spectra and theoretical calculations indicate that oxide ions as well as titanium ions are involved in electronic structural changes caused by electrochemical lithium ion insertions. The considerable effect of the oxide ions in the early 3d transition metal (titanium) oxide system is discussed in this article.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha	TNF-alpha	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been expected to be a promising new antitumor agent, but toxic side effects by the systemic administration of TNF-alpha limit its clinical application. In this study, we attempted to improve the therapeutic potency of TNF-alpha by using our protein-drug innovation systems. Among phage libraries displaying various mutant TNF-alphas, we isolated some lysine-deficient super mutant TNF-alphas, typified by mTNF-alpha-K90R, with higher TNF-receptor affinities and stronger bioactivity in vitro, in spite of the importance of lysine residues for trimer formation and receptor binding. mTNF-alpha-K90R showed more than 10 times stronger in vivo antitumor effects and 1.3 times less toxicity than wild-type TNF-alpha (wTNF-alpha). Site-specifically mono-PEGylated mTNF-alpha-K90R (sp-PEG-mTNF-alpha-K90R) at N-terminus showed higher in vitro bioactivity than unmodified wTNF-alpha, whereas randomly mono-PEGylated wTNF-alpha at a lysine residue (ran-PEG-wTNF-alpha) had less than 6% of the bioactivity of wTNF-alpha. The antitumor therapeutic window of sp-PEG-mTNF-alpha-K90R was extended by about 5 times, 60 times and 18 times compared with those of mTNF-alpha-K90R, wTNF-alpha and ran-PEG-wTNF-alpha, respectively. sp-PEG-mTNF-alpha-K90R may, thus, be a potential systemic anti-tumor therapeutic agent. These data suggested that our fusion protein-drug innovation system composed of a creation system of functional mutant proteins based on phage display technique and a site-specific PEGylation system may open up a new avenue to the optimal protein therapy.

Hamilton Depression Scale	HAM-D	An association between depression and physical dependency arising from a recent illness has been generally accepted. To clarify this relationship over time, 30 medical rehabilitation patients aged 54 to 94 years were assessed 1 week after admission and at discharge to quantify symptoms of depression, physical dependency, and cognitive functioning using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Barthel Index for physical function, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Significant depressive symptomatology was found by HAM-D in 25 patients on admission and 14 on discharge. No significant associations were present between either admission or discharge depression scores and all other variables. The HAM-D change score was significantly correlated with the Barthel change score (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001) and with the MMSE change score (r = 0.48, P = 0.01). All patients whose mood improved also improved in physical functioning, whereas 75% of those whose mood did not improve failed to make headway in physical functioning. This implies that it is not the degree of physical incapacity but rather the failure to regain prior abilities which is strongly associated with persisting depression following a catastrophic illness. Furthermore, characteristics found commonly in the group whose mood did not improve included physicians' failure to diagnose and treat depression or a setback from a significant medical or surgical complication.

Significant depressive symptomatology was found by HAM-D in 25 patients on admission and 14 on discharge. No significant associations were present between either admission or discharge depression scores and all other variables. The HAM-D change score was significantly correlated with the Barthel change score (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001) and with the MMSE change score (r = 0.48, P = 0.01). All patients whose mood improved also improved in physical functioning, whereas 75% of those whose mood did not improve failed to make headway in physical functioning. This implies that it is not the degree of physical incapacity but rather the failure to regain prior abilities which is strongly associated with persisting depression following a catastrophic illness. Furthermore, characteristics found commonly in the group whose mood did not improve included physicians' failure to diagnose and treat depression or a setback from a significant medical or surgical complication.
Multiple sclerosis	MS	Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) have been found to occur in combination. Based on an extensive literature search and on a clinical analysis of 55 LHON pedigrees (103 patients) and 40 patients with definite MS, this study concludes that the association of LHON and MS is more than a coincidence, and that carrying a primary LHON mutation is a risk factor for developing MS. All three primary LHON mutations occurring in the European and North American populations have been found to be associated with an MS-like syndrome. The neurological characteristics of MS associated with LHON are indistinguishable from those of MS in general, but the severe and bilateral visual symptoms and signs justify considering these patients as a clinical subgroup of MS and screening them for LHON mutations. However, screening LHON patients for MS appears to be more rewarding.

high-energy ultraviolet A	UVA	Aim: To evaluate the ability of high-energy ultraviolet A (UVA) light-emitting diode (LED) to inactivate bacteria in water and investigate the inactivating mechanism of UVA irradiation. Methods and Results: We developed a new disinfection device equipped with high-energy UVA-LED. Inactivation of bacteria was determined by colony-forming assay. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli DH5alpha were reduced by greater than 5-log(10) stages within 75 min at 315 J cm(-2) of UVA. Salmonella enteritidis was reduced greater than 4-log(10) stages within 160 min at 672 J cm(-2) of UVA. The formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in UVA-LED irradiated bacteria was 2.6-fold higher than that of UVC-irradiated bacteria at the same inactivation level. Addition of mannitol, a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (OH( )), or catalase, an enzyme scavenging hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to bacterial suspensions significantly suppressed disinfection effect of UVA-LED. Conclusion: This disinfection system has enough ability to inactivate bacteria and OH( ) and H(2)O(2) participates in the disinfection mechanism of UVA irradiation. Significance and Impact of the Study: We newly developed UVA irradiation system and found that UVA alone was able to disinfect the water efficiently. This will become a useful disinfection system.

2'deoxycoformycin	2'dCF	A flow-limited physiologic mathematical model has been developed to describe the time course of 2'deoxycoformycin (2'dCF) concentrations in the plasma and tissues of mice following iv and ip doses. Urinary excretion is modeled as a linear involving filtration and secretion, since kidney clearance exceeded estimated glomerular filtration rate. Intracellular binding is described as the sum of linear nonspecific binding plus strong saturable binding to adenosine deaminase. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined by a sequential optimization scheme in which each tissue is studied by means of a hybrid model. The model has been used to predict pharmacokinetic behaviour of 2'dCF in both normal and leukemic mice, and model simulations are compared with published data.
Telomerase activity	TA	PURPOSE: Telomerase activity (TA) has been extensively studied in tumors of many organs, but not the parathyroid gland. Therefore, we investigated TA in parathyroid tumors, and examined the mRNA expression of its catalytic subunits. METHODS: We examined 17 single adenomas, one hyperplastic parathyroid gland, and one metastatic parathyroid cancer and quantified TA by fluorescence-based TRAP analysis. We also studied the expression of telomerase catalytic subunits in nine adenomas and one cancer by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Telomerase activity was not detected in any of the adenomas or the hyperplastic gland; however, the metastatic cancer was highly positive for TA. Both human telomerase RNA ( hTR) and human telomerase-associated pretein (hTEP-1) mRNA were detected universally in every specimen tested. Conversely, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA was not detected by the conventional electrophoresis-based technique. Faint expression of hTERT mRNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR only in the sample of parathyroid cancer. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that TA plays a role in the malignant transformation of parathyroid disease and suggest that hTERT mRNA expression could be the key step for TA as in other malignancies. Telomerase activity and hTERT may be useful molecular targets of parathyroid cancer.

2,7-bis	BCECF	The pH-sensitive, fluorescent, cytoplasmic-trapped dye 2,7-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) has been used to measure intracellular (pHi) and pH electrode to measure extracellular pH (pHo) in suspensions of gastric glands isolated from rabbit stomachs. The fluorescence of BCECF-loaded glands was calibrated in terms of pHi by equilibrating pHo and pHi using ionophores or digitonin and titrating pHo to different values. An APPENDIX is included that covers details of dye calibration and interpretation of fluorescence signals. Glands incubated in NaCl Ringer solution had pHi 7.11. Na+-free Ringer solution caused pHi to decrease reversibly to 6.80. Na+-dependent alkalinization of pHi followed a similar time course to the acidification of pHo. These changes were blocked by 1 mM amiloride. When gland cells were acidified (using two different techniques) realkalinization was completely Na+ dependent but was independent of the presence of Cl-; also, neither high extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) nor high [K+]o plus 10(-5) M valinomycin affected the rates of Na+-dependent alkalinization. A neutral Na+-H+ exchanger was implicated. Glands also exhibited Cl(-)-dependent changes of pHi that were blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (2 X 10(-4) M). A Cl(-)-OH-(HCO3-) exchanger was indicated. Other studies showed that intracellular buffering capacity was approximately 45 mM (pH-1) and that the apparent proton conductance of gland cell membranes was small.

Erythema nodosum leprosum	ENL	Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a serious complication of lepromatous leprosy, affecting skin and peripheral nerves in a large percentage of these patients, and is presumed to result from spontaneous immunologic changes. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, although histopathologic features have suggested immune complex (IC)-mediated injury. Abundant circulating antibody is present but no convincing correlation has been established between circulating IC and ENL. We have examined cutaneous leprosy lesions in vivo using blisters induced by prolonged gentle suction to determine whether or not IC are demonstrable in lesions with or without ENL, using an IC assay based on monoclonal rheumatoid factor binding. We also examined whether antibodies involved in such IC are produced locally or reach the skin via the circulation. Surprisingly large quantities of IC were found in ENL lesions, and in some cases the quantities were significantly higher than in matching serum. Total IgG, IgA, and IgM in the skin were not higher than expected, however. Attempts to demonstrate increases in intracutaneous levels of specific anti-Mycobacterium leprae antibodies were unsuccessful. This is the first report of the demonstration of IC in suction blister fluid. The results indicate that large quantities of IC may be present in cutaneous leprosy lesions and are consistent with the hypothesis that they are formed in situ when circulating antibody combines with antigen in the skin. The nature of the antigen in these IC remains undefined.

Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy	TPEFM	Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (TPEFM) permits the investigation of the topology of intercellular events within living animals. TPEFM was used to monitor the distribution of mitochondrial reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(P)H) in murine skeletal muscle in vivo. NAD(P)H fluorescence emission was monitored ( approximately 460 nm) using 710-720 nm excitation. High-resolution TPEFM images were collected up to a depth of 150 microm from the surface of the tibialis anterior muscle. The NAD(P)H fluorescence images revealed subcellular structures consistent with subsarcolemmal, perivascular, intersarcomeric, and paranuclear mitochondria. In vivo fiber typing between IIB and IIA/D fibers was possible using the distribution and content of mitochondria from the NAD(P)H fluorescence signal. The intersarcomeric mitochondria concentrated at the Z-line in the IIB fiber types resulting in a periodic pattern with a spacing of one sarcomere (2.34 +/- 0.17 microm). The primary inner filter effects were nearly equivalent to water, however, the secondary inner filter effects were highly significant and dynamically affected the observed emission frequency and amplitude of the NAD(P)H fluorescence signal. These data demonstrate the feasibility, and highlight the complexity, of using NAD(P)H TPEFM in skeletal muscle to characterize the topology and metabolic function of mitochondria within the living mouse.
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry	ICP-MS	Provenance and authenticity of wines can be recognized on the basis of typical mineral and trace element patterns by means of chemometric methods. Therefore analytical methods were developed for the determination of As, Be, Co, Cs, Ga, Li, Nb, Ni, Rb, Te, Ti, W, Y, and Zr as well as Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl, U, and the rare earth elements in wines by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For low risk of contamination or loss of analyte as well as depletion of sample amount and an easy sample pretreatment, direct measurement of diluted wines was studied. The accuracy of the analytical results was proven by recovery experiments by method comparison with standard addition methods and measurement of digested wines. In addition to applying statistical methods for characterizing the precision of the methods, the uncertainty of the measurements was estimated. Results for the elements mentioned above and additional 16 elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mg, P, Pb, Si, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn) were evaluated by data analytical methods. Due to a specific choice of the analytes for multivariate statistical investigation a prediction rate by cross validation of 88.6% could be achieved.
low density lipoproteins	LDL	By photoaffinity labeling human low density lipoproteins (LDL) with [125I]T4 we confirmed our previous observation that of the three T4 binding sites of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) one is in its 26% NH2-terminal portion [apoB-26, the 140 kDa fragment, residues 1-1297] and two in the remaining 74% COOH portion (apoB-74, 410 kDa, residues 1298-4536). We now show that of these two sites one is in the NH2 portion of apoB-74 (apoB-44, 240 kDa, residues 1298-3249) and the other in the nonoverlapping COOH portion (apoB-30, 170 kDa, residues 3250-4536). ApoB-100 contains 13 binding sites for heparin, a known inhibitor of T4 binding to the major T4 carrier plasma proteins; however, heparin failed to inhibit T4 binding to apoB-100 and fragments thereof. The same failure was seen with three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 4G3, 5E11, and 43 that block totally or partially LDL binding to the LDL receptor [respective epitopes at residues 2980-3084 (apoB-44), 3441-3569, and 4027-4081 (apoB-30)]. Of the other 3 MAbs, all without effect on LDL binding to the LDL receptor, [1D1, 2D8, and 16, respective epitopes at residues 474-539 (apoB-26), 1438-1481 (apoB-44), and 4154-4189 (apoB-30)], only two (MAbs 1D1 and 2D8) inhibited T4 binding (21 to 39%). We conclude that the three T4-binding sites of apoB-100 are outside the LDL receptor binding domain, distant from the heparin binding sites and, assuming no allosteric effects, in the vicinity of residues 474-539 (T4 site of apoB-26), 1438-1481 (T4 site of apoB-44), and in the C terminal quarter of apoB-30.

Growth hormone-stimulated insulin-like growth factor	IGF	Growth hormone-stimulated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and IGF-binding protein-3 in liver cirrhosis.
insulin-like growth factor	IGF	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the liver's potential to generate insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), following stimulation by human recombinant growth hormone, as a possible marker for liver functional reserve in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: In a pilot study, 15 patients (mean age 56 years) with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis were divided into two groups according to disease severity (Child-Pugh score): Group 1 (n=8) with scores of 5-8 and Group 2 (n=7) with scores of 9-12. Five age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Human recombinant growth hormone (0.06 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously on 2 consecutive days. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured before and up to 48 h after human recombinant growth hormone injection. Nutritional status was assessed by the creatinine-height index and was compared to lymphocyte count, body mass index, and muscle arm circumference. RESULTS: Baseline IGF-I levels were significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than in controls, while no differences were noted between the two patient groups. IGF-I levels increased significantly after rhGH administration to the healthy controls, to a lower degree in Group 1, while no change occurred in Group 2. IGF-I levels at 24 h and beyond correlated significantly with the nutritional status, the Child-Pugh score, and the basal levels of GH-binding protein and IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 serum levels did not change after rhGH stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: IGF-I generation after GH stimulation may provide a new dimension in the assessment of liver function and nutritional status in patients with liver cirrhosis.

sulbactam/cefoperazone	SBT/CPZ	Fundamental and clinical studies on sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), a combination drug of sulbactam and cefoperazone, were carried out in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The following results were obtained: Transfer into female genital organ tissues Following 1 hour intravenous drip infusion of SBT/CPZ, favourable transfers of both of SBT and CPZ to female genital organ tissues and pelvic dead space exudate were observed. Clinical evaluation A total of 12 cases comprising 6 with intrauterine infection, 1 with pyometra, 1 with abscess of portio vaginalis, 2 with parametritis, 1 with pelvioperitonitis and 1 with purulent lymphocyst was treated with SBT/CPZ. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 6 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, with overall efficacy rate of 92%. The bacteriological efficacy was judged as eradicated in 3, and as decreased in 2 out of 5 evaluable cases. In all of the 5 cases, isolated organisms were beta-lactamase producing organisms. No notable side effects or abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 1 case with elevations of GOT and GPT.
Human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA in plasma as the preferred target for therapy in patients with HIV infection: a critique.
human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	The measurement of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA copies in plasma establishes the prognosis for HIV-infected patients and provides a rapid method of assessing the efficacy of a new antiretroviral agent. However, whether or not periodic measurement of plasma HIV RNA will aid physicians in the long-term treatment of infected patients remains to be proven. Dr. Fessel has reviewed the available literature and suggests that the enthusiasm for this technique of managing HIV infection may be premature. Dr. Fessel emphasizes that solid evidence is needed to prove that prolonged suppression of plasma levels of HIV RNA reflects suppression of viral replication in the lymphoreticular tissue and prevents selection of resistant HIV variants. With such evidence, the usefulness of the plasma HIV RNA assay in the treatment of HIV-infected patients will be more firmly established.
day one after parturition	DAP	The activity of acid phosphatase (phosphohydrolase of orthophosphate monoesters; EC. 3.1.3.2) was evaluated densitometrically in the mucosa of duodenum, jejunum and ileum of 22 conventional piglets which were experimentally infected by oocysts of the coccidiae Isospora suis (infection dose of 200,000 oocysts) on day one after parturition (DAP). The activity of the studied hydrolase was investigated in the infected piglets during days two to ten after infection (DAI) in the intestinal mucosa (enterocytes) and in goblet cells. The density of the reaction product of acid phosphatase was simultaneously determined in the same mucosal cells of different sections of the small intestine in five control conventional piglets at the age of 2-14 days. In the small intestine mucosa of control piglets the activity of acid phosphatase was demonstrated to be located especially in the supranuclear zone of enterocytes. As for goblet cells, the reaction product of acid phosphatase is distributed in all zones (supra-, para-, infranuclear zones); the lowest density of this enzyme was found in the infranuclear zone. The activity of acid phosphatase is also localized in intestinal crypts: in their cells the enzyme concentration is decreasing from duodenum to caudal sections. Important changes were revealed, in comparison with the control data, in the development of the activity of acid phosphatase in the intestinal mucosa cells in the experimentally infected piglets. In the period of investigation (DAI 2-10) there were two stages of the development of the density of the enzyme reaction product. The first stage can be characterized by an increase, the other by a decrease in the level of acid phosphatase activity. Enterocytes are influenced in both stages, but the decrease in the density of the reaction product of acid phosphatase was observed only in absorption cells, and not in goblet cells. The increase in the activity of acid phosphatase occurs in the periods of DAI 4 and 9-10. Enzymatic deviations occur mainly in the absorption cells of the mucosa of duodenum and middle jejunum; in the cells of posterior jejunum and ileum an increase in the density of the reaction product of acid phosphatase was also demonstrated, but at the lower quantitative level (especially on DAI 4). The decrease in the activity of acid phosphatase has a protracted development and it takes place on DAI 5 to 8. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
plasma noradrenaline	NA	The use of the plasma noradrenaline (NA) concentration as an index of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in the postprandial state is associated with several problems: (i) It does not take into account the contribution of alterations in clearance to the plasma NA level, (ii) when antecubital venous blood is sampled, it reflects regional forearm rather than whole body SNS activity and (iii) no insight is gained into the regional pattern of SNS activation. These potential confounders were addressed in this study performed in 17 healthy young men. The validity of plasma NA measurements in assessing postprandial changes in sympathetic nervous activation was evaluated in relation to that of whole body and regional plasma NA spillover, derived using isotope dilution methodology. Plasma clearance of NA is significantly altered following a meal, with a transient elevation in the early postprandial phase which may lead to an underestimation of SNS activation when assessed from arterial plasma NA levels. Forearm plasma NA spillover increases postprandially, such that despite significant postprandial elevations in arterial plasma NA, the plasma arterial contribution to antecubital venous plasma NA levels is maintained at less than 40%, the rest being derived locally from the forearm. This makes venous plasma samples unsuitable for the assessment of SNS activation in organs and vascular sites distant from the sampling site. The kidneys and skeletal muscle are the major regional sites of postprandial sympathetic nervous activation, while cardiac plasma NE spillover is unaltered postprandially. This regional pattern of SNS activation postprandially must be taken into account when relating increments in plasma NA levels to specific physiological events.

Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale	CES-D	OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence, persistence, and correlates of depressive symptoms in mothers of toddlers in a nationally representative sample. METHOD: The self-report components of two linked databases were used for this study, the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and the 1991 Longitudinal Followup. Depressive symptoms of 7,537 mothers were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) at both time points. Weighted bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the stability of maternal depressive symptoms across two time points and maternal and child predictors of elevated depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of mothers at time 1 (mean child age 17 months) and 17% at time 2 (mean child age 35 months) had elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D score > or =16). Thirty-six percent of those with elevated scores at time 1 also had elevated scores at time 2. Not having breast-fed, a mistimed or unwanted pregnancy, and poor child health status were related to elevated depressive symptoms but not persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated depressive symptoms are common in mothers of toddlers. Given the potential magnitude of need, a systematic clinical and public health approach may be required.
short-chain fructooligosaccharides	FOS	We aimed to study the effects of chronic ingestion of short-chain fructooligosaccharides (FOS), an indigestible carbohydrate, on hepatic glucose production, insulin-mediated glucose metabolism, erythrocyte insulin binding, and blood lipids in healthy subjects. Twelve healthy volunteers received either 20 g FOS/d or sucrose for 4 wk in a double-blind crossover design. FOS did not modify fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Mean (+/- SEM) basal hepatic glucose production was lower after FOS than after sucrose consumption (2.18 +/- 0.10 compared with 2.32 +/- 0.09 mg.kg-1, min-1, respectively; P < 0.02, paired Student's t test). However, neither insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production nor insulin stimulation of glucose uptake measured by hyperinsulinemic clamp was significantly different between the two dietary periods. Erythrocyte insulin binding was also comparable. Serum triacylglycerols, total and high-density- lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and B, and lipoprotein(a) were not modified by FOS. To try to understand why FOS did not increase serum lipids, the in vitro production of short-chain fatty acids from FOS was evaluated by using human fecal inoculum and compared with that from lactulose, which was found to increase serum lipids. FOS produced an acetate-propionate ratio two times lower than that of lactulose. We conclude that 4 wk of 20 g FOS/d decreased basal hepatic glucose production but had no detectable effect on insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in healthy subjects. The colonic fermentation pattern of undigestible carbohydrates may be relevant to predicting their metabolic effects.
Mastoparan	MP	Mastoparan (MP), a wasp venom peptide, is known both to interact with G-proteins and to alter membrane structure and function. To determine the structural requirements for these two aspects of MP action, we constructed several analogs of the peptide and characterized them using Swiss 3T3 cell membranes. The effects of these peptides were measured on: i) G-protein-mediated stimulation of phospholipase-C activity by GTP gamma S and bombesin and ii) the membrane enzyme activities, calcium-activated phospholipase-C and Na,K-ATPase. MP strongly inhibited all the above activities and caused membrane permeabilization. Substitution of one Lys residue by Gly at either the N- or C-terminal of the MP molecule resulted in peptides which selectively inhibited G-protein stimulated phospholipase-C with no or very slight membrane-perturbing effects. Introduction of additional Lys residues to MP led to the opposite effect. Thus, G-protein modulating and membrane disrupting actions of MP appear to be not necessarily linked, and may be separated.
malondialdehyde	MDA	Dietary fat, arachidonic acid metabolism and lipid peroxidation have all been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Fatty acids, prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2 alpha) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the stable end-product of lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), were studied in paired tumour and normal mucosa of 20 patients with colorectal cancer. Levels of arachidonic acid and total PUFAs were increased in the phospholipid fraction of tumours (P < 0.05). Levels of PGE2 and MDA were also higher in tumours (P < 0.001) and there was a significant correlation between MDA and PGE2 concentrations (rs = 0.69, P < 0.01). In contrast to previously reported in vitro studies, this work suggests that lipid peroxidation may be enhanced in human colorectal tumours. As PGE2 and MDA have been shown to be involved in carcinogenesis, these may be considered potential therapeutic targets for preventing or treating colorectal carcinoma.

avidin-biotin complex	ABC	The sensitivity and specificity of 3 avidin-biotin complex (ABC) immunostaining systems were compared on paraffin-embedded tissues from African swine fever virus (ASFV)-infected pigs. Results were also compared with immunofluorescent detection on cryosections of the same tissue for optimal detection of ASFV antigen. The ABC-alkaline phosphatase (ABC-AP) and ABC-peroxidase (ABC-PO) systems were at least as sensitive as direct fluorescent antibody (FA) and 10-fold more sensitive than the ABC-glucose oxidase system. Three ABC-AP and 2 ABC-PO chromagens with different counterstains were compared. In addition, 2 fixatives, 2 biotinylation procedures, 7 endogenous peroxidase blocking regimes, 6 tissue adhesives, and 3 mounting media were compared. The ABC-AP system with a red chromagen and hematoxylin counterstaining was preferred and most closely approximated routinely stained pathologic sections. Fixation in paraformalde-hydelysine-periodate fixative preserved ASFV antigen for research studies for at least 3 years. Formalin-fixed tissues retained some staining for up to 10 years.

endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography	ERCP	OBJECTIVES: Adequate patient sedation is mandatory for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In this respect it is known that the short-acting anesthetic propofol offers certain potential advantages for sedation during ERCP, but there are no controlled studies concerning the feasibility and safety of propofol sedation in elderly, high-risk patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients aged >or=80 yr with high comorbidity (ASA score >or=III: 91 %), randomly received midazolam plus meperidine (n = 75) or propofol alone (n = 75) for sedation during ERCP. Vital signs were continuously monitored and procedure-related parameters, recovery time, and quality as well as patients' cooperation and tolerance of the procedure were assessed. RESULTS: Clinically relevant changes in vital signs were observed at comparable frequencies with a temporary oxygen desaturation (<90%) occurring in eight patients in the propofol-group and seven patients receiving midazolam/meperidine (n.s.). Hypotension was documented in two patients in the propofol group and one patient receiving midazolam/meperidine. Propofol provided a significantly better patient cooperation than midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01), but the procedure tolerability was rated nearly the same by both groups. Mean recovery time was significantly shorter in the propofol group (22 +/- 7 min vs 31 +/- 8 min for midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01)) while the recovery score was significantly higher under propofol (8.3 +/- 1.2 vs 6.1 +/- 1.1(p < 0.01)). During recovery a significant lower number of desaturation events (<90%) were observed in the propofol group (12%) than in the midazolam/meperidine group (26%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Under careful monitoring the use of propofol for sedation during ERCP is superior to midazolam/meperidine even in high-risk octogenarians.
Giant cell tumor	GCT	Giant cell tumor (GCT), aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), and simple bone cyst (SBC) represent relatively common tumors and tumorlike conditions to affect bone. This article describes the clinical presentation of these lesions, as well as the characteristic radiologic and pathologic findings of each. In addition, differential diagnoses, disease course, and various treatment options are discussed.

sister chromatid exchangec	SCE	Increased rate of sister chromatid exchangec (SCE) in peripheral lymphocytes has been observed in smokers as compared to nonsmokers and in patients receiving certain cytostatic drugs. The increased SCE frequency in smokers was shown to depend on the number of cigarettes smoked per day, as well as on the duration of smoking. DNA cross-links caused by photochemotherapy against psoriasis, 8-methoxypsoralen plus UVA irradiation (PUVA), as well as by the anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent CCNU, were shown to be more effective at inducing SCE's than other types of DNA damage caused by these treatments. These observations suggest that SCE analysis may be used as an indicator of genotoxic exposure in vivo, provided that the various types of DNA damage caused by genotoxic agents and the dose, as well as the time of exposure in relation to the time of sampling, are considered.

high litter size	L+	Genetic differences in natural vs hormone-induced ovulation rates were compared in immature female mice from five lines that had undergone long-term single-trait and antagonistic index selection for litter size and(or) 6-wk BW. Lines used were control (K); high litter size (L+); high BW (W+); low litter size and high BW (L-W+); and high litter size and low BW (L+W-). Natural ovulation rate at a mean age of 34.3 d and hormone-induced (5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin followed 2 d later by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin) superovulation rate at a fixed age of 31 d were obtained. Total number of eggs ovulated was affected by line (P less than .001), treatment (P less than .001), and line x treatment interaction (P less than .001). Line differences were subsequently tested within treatment because of the significant line x treatment interaction. Line differences were important (P less than .001) for natural ovulation, hormone-induced ovulation, and response to hormones. Mean natural ovulation rates for K, L+, W+, L-W+, and L+W- were 14.1, 19.8, 15.1, 13.6, and 16.4, respectively. Selection changed ovulation rate by 40, 16, 7, and -4% in the L+, L+W-, W+ and L-W+ lines, respectively (P less than .01). Hormone-induced ovulation rates in K, L+, W+, L-W+, and L+W- were 32.3, 24.6, 19.6, 20.9, and 22.1, respectively. Exogenous hormones increased ovulation by 18.2, 4.8, 4.6, 7.3, and 5.7 ova for K, L+, W+, L-W+, and L+W-, respectively (P less than .001). Lines with lower natural ovulation rates had higher responses to superovulation. Increased ovulation rate due to treatment ranged from 24.3% in L+ to 129% in K. These results indicate significant differences among lines in ovarian response to exogenous hormones.

Interleukin-4	IL-4	Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine secreted by interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated lymphocytes. IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes also secrete two cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), which contribute to effector function and which may themselves recruit fresh, cytokine-secreting effector cells. We have now investigated whether the IL-4 induced is able to homeostatically regulate secretion of the TNF and IFN-gamma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymphocytes from normal donors and from patients with neoplastic disease were cultured in the presence of IL-2 alone, IL-4 alone or with both cytokines. IL-2 induced high levels of TNF and IFN-gamma secretion in both groups. The addition of recombinant IL-4 to these IL-2-stimulated cultures lead to significant inhibition of IFN-gamma and TNF production. IFN-gamma secretion was reduced by 50-99% in normal donors and by between 11% and 99% in patients (P less than 0.001). TNF levels induced by IL-2 were similarly reduced by IL-4 both in normal donors (P less than 0.003) and in patients (P less than 0.01). These inhibitory effects were produced by IL-4 at doses of IL-2 attainable in vivo. Inhibition appears to represent a homeostatic regulatory mechanism which may limit recruitment of fresh activated killer (AK) cells. When endogenous IL-4 activity in IL-2-activated lymphocytes was blocked by anti-IL-4 antibody, significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma and TNF were secreted (P less than 0.05). Since both TNF and IFN-gamma may contribute to the anti-neoplastic action of IL-2, manipulating the level of IL-4 activity in vivo could augment the benefits of IL-2 immunotherapy.

microvascular decompression	MVD	OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of microvascular decompression (MVD) and to identify the factors affecting outcome in patients treated for primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Only the cases with a clear-cut neurovascular conflict (vascular contact and/or compression of the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve) found at surgery and treated with "pure" MVD (decompression of the root without any additional lesioning or cutting of the adjacent rootlets) were retained. METHODS: The study included 362 patients who were followed up over a period of 1 to 18 years (median follow-up 7.2 years). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was generated at 1 and 15 years of follow-up for all of the considered factors. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate (defined as pain-free patients without any medication) was 91% at 1 year and estimated to be 73.38% after 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: None of the following patient-related factors played any significant role in prognosis: sex, patient age at surgery, history of systemic hypertension, duration of neuralgia before surgery, or history of failed trigeminal surgery. Patients with atypical neuralgia (a baseline of permanent pain) had the same outcome as those with a typical (purely spasmodic) presentation. In addition, the side and topography of the trigeminal nerve did not play a role, whereas involvement of all three divisions of the nerve had a negative effect on outcome. Concerning anatomical factors, neither the type of the compressive vessel nor its location along or around the root was found to be significant. However, the severity of compression was important-the more severe the degree of compression, the better the outcome (p = 0.002). The authors also found that presence of focal arachnoiditis had a negative influence on outcome (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pure MVD can offer patients affected by a primary TN a 73.38% probability of long-term (15 years) cure of neuralgia. The presence of a clear-cut and marked vascular compression at surgery (and possibly-although not yet reliably--on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging) is the guarantee of a higher than 90% success rate.
primary trigeminal neuralgia	TN	OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of microvascular decompression (MVD) and to identify the factors affecting outcome in patients treated for primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Only the cases with a clear-cut neurovascular conflict (vascular contact and/or compression of the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve) found at surgery and treated with "pure" MVD (decompression of the root without any additional lesioning or cutting of the adjacent rootlets) were retained. METHODS: The study included 362 patients who were followed up over a period of 1 to 18 years (median follow-up 7.2 years). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was generated at 1 and 15 years of follow-up for all of the considered factors. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate (defined as pain-free patients without any medication) was 91% at 1 year and estimated to be 73.38% after 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: None of the following patient-related factors played any significant role in prognosis: sex, patient age at surgery, history of systemic hypertension, duration of neuralgia before surgery, or history of failed trigeminal surgery. Patients with atypical neuralgia (a baseline of permanent pain) had the same outcome as those with a typical (purely spasmodic) presentation. In addition, the side and topography of the trigeminal nerve did not play a role, whereas involvement of all three divisions of the nerve had a negative effect on outcome. Concerning anatomical factors, neither the type of the compressive vessel nor its location along or around the root was found to be significant. However, the severity of compression was important-the more severe the degree of compression, the better the outcome (p = 0.002). The authors also found that presence of focal arachnoiditis had a negative influence on outcome (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pure MVD can offer patients affected by a primary TN a 73.38% probability of long-term (15 years) cure of neuralgia. The presence of a clear-cut and marked vascular compression at surgery (and possibly-although not yet reliably--on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging) is the guarantee of a higher than 90% success rate.
nerve growth factor	NGF	Inflammation induces an upregulation of sodium channels in sensory neurons. This most likely occurs as a result of the retrograde transport of cytochemical mediators released during the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the subcutaneous administration of one such mediator, nerve growth factor (NGF), on the production of sodium channels in neurons of the rat dorsal root ganglion. For this, hindpaw withdrawal from either a thermal or mechanical stimulus was measured in rats at selected intervals for up to 2 weeks following injections of NGF. Sodium channel augmentation was then examined in dorsal root ganglia using site-specific, anti-sodium channel antibodies. Both thermal and mechanical allodynia was observed between 3 and 12 h post-injection. The hyperalgesic response returned to baseline by approximately 24 h post-injection. Sodium channel labeling was found to increase dramatically in the small neurons of the associated dorsal root ganglia beginning at 23 h, reached maximum intensity by 1 week, and persisted for up to 3 months post-injection. Pre-blocking NGF with anti-NGF prevented the NGF-induced decrease in paw withdrawal latencies and significantly reduced the intensity of sodium channel labeling. The results indicate that NGF is an important mediator both in the development of acute hyperalgesia and in the stimulation of sodium channel production in dorsal root ganglia during inflammation.
cold ischemia	CI	The aim of the study was to characterize the role of cold ischemia in the process of acute rejection using an experimental renal transplant model. Syngeneic renal transplants were performed between Wistar Agouti rats and allogeneic grafts using Wistar-Agouti rats as recipients of Brown-Norway kidneys. For cold ischemia (CI), kidneys were preserved in Euro-Collins (4 degrees C/ 2.5 hours). Rats were bilaterally nephrectomized at the moment of renal transplant and did not receive any immunosuppressant. The groups were NoAR (n = 6): immediate syngeneic transplant; CI-NoAR (n = 6): syngeneic transplant with CI; AR (n = 13): immediate allogeneic graft; CI-AR (n = 6): allogeneic graft with CI. Allogeneic rats were followed for the survival study. Syngeneic rats, with mean survival time beyond 6 months, were sacrificed on the day 7 to compare grafts with those in the allogeneic groups. H&E- and PAS-stained grafts were evaluated using the Banff criteria. Tissue INF-gamma and TNF-alpha were quantified by RT-real time-PCR on the kidney grafts. Renal insufficiency did not appear in the NoAR group, but it did from the posttransplant day 5 in both acute rejection groups. While NoAR kidneys showed well-conserved renal architecture, then AR group displayed variable degrees of tubular necrosis with scarce cellular infiltration, interstitial hemorrhage, vascular damage with fibrinoid necrosis, perivascular edema, and nuclear disruption. Cold ischemia in rejecting animals increased the mortality rate due to renal insufficiency and accelerated acute rejection. Independently of CI, the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and INF-gamma were increased in both rejection groups. In conclusion, addition of CI overactivates the acute rejection process via a humoral component.
slow correcting gaze movements	SCMs	Recent experimental results show evidence for the corrective role of postsaccadic drifts. This paper addresses the modeling of these slow correcting gaze movements (SCMs). Classical arguments to explain drifts are presented, both in the head fixed condition (pulse-step mismatch) and in the head free condition (vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)). The most significant behavioral and electrophysiological experimental data related to SCMs are then briefly reported, with the conclusion that SCMs have a clear corrective role, incompatible with classical explanations of drifts. Based on these experimental data, existing models of the saccadic system are then compared. A theoretical comparison of the classical Robinson model with an alternative model is proposed. Two possible (slow and fast) pathways involved in the control of SCMs are examined, and simulation results are presented. Finally, the discussion addresses the observed species differences in SCMs. The link between natural SCMs and electrical SC stimulations, and the interactions between saccades, VOR, and SCMs are also discussed.

erythroid differentiation-related factor	EDRF	BACKGROUND: In 2001, it was demonstrated that the expression of the erythroid differentiation-related factor (EDRF) is reduced in lymphatic tissues of rodents and cattle as well as in whole blood of sheep that suffer from transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine whether the normal range of EDRF expression varies in healthy individuals, mRNA levels were measured in whole blood samples from 106 healthy blood donors by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, the correlations of transcript levels with individual physical characteristics were analyzed. In addition, EDRF expression was examined in total RNA samples from a lymph node and the intestine. RESULTS: The data show that EDRF mRNA levels in healthy persons vary within a total range of 2 log units as well as they display a weak correlation with body height. Furthermore, it was found that EDRF is also expressed in lymph nodes and the intestine. CONCLUSION: Owing to its broad range of variation, measuring the EDRF expression does not seem to be a good surrogate marker, unless an altered expression is distinctively different from the varying level in healthy humans.
Perinatal hypoxia ischemia	HI	Perinatal hypoxia ischemia (HI) is a frequent cause of neonatal brain injury. This study aimed at describing molecular changes during the first 48 h after exposure of the neonatal rat brain to HI. Twelve-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion and 90 min of 8% O2, leading to neuronal damage in the ipsilateral hemisphere only. Phosphorylated-Akt levels were decreased from 0.5 to 6 h post-HI, whereas the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)1/2 increased during this time frame. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein increased with a peak at 3 h after HI. mRNA expression for IL-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta started to increase at 6 h with a peak at 24 h post-HI. Expression of heat shock protein 70 was increased from 12 h after HI onwards in the ipsilateral hemisphere only. Surprisingly, HI changed the expression of cytokines, HIF1-alpha ,and P-Akt to the same extent in both the ipsi- as well as the contralateral hemisphere, although neuronal damage was unilateral. Exposure of animals to hypoxia without carotid artery occlusion induced similar changes in cytokines, HIF-1alpha, and P-Akt. We conclude that during HI, hypoxia is sufficient to regulate multiple molecular mediators that may contribute, but are not sufficient, to induce long-term neuronal damage.

Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome	HPS	Individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) lack platelet dense granules and have no ADP-autocrine response. Despite these platelet deficiencies, HPS patients exhibit a surprisingly mild bleeding phenotype. We hypothesize that activation of the PAR4 thrombin receptor compensates for the lack of an ADP-autocrine response by the P2Y12 ADP receptor in individuals with HPS. Here, we determine that PAR4 activation by thrombin occurs well after ADP release from dense granules in normal individuals. However, the signal from PAR4 stabilizes platelet-platelet aggregate formation in the absence of P2Y12 activation by ADP. Thus, the strong signal emanating from PAR4 during platelet aggregation would provide an explanation for the mild bleeding diathesis of HPS.
364 amino acids	aa	The korAB operon of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 encodes five genes, two of which, incC and korB, belong to the parA and parB families, respectively, of genome partitioning functions. Both korB and a third gene, korA, are responsible for coordinate regulation of operons encoding replication, transfer, and stable inheritance functions. Overexpression of incC alone caused rapid displacement of RK2. Using two different reporter systems, we show that incC modulates the action of KorB. Using promoter fusions to the reporter gene xylE, we show that incC potentiates the repression of transcription by korB. This modulation of korB activity was only observed with incC1, which encodes the full-length IncC (364 amino acids [aa]), whereas no effect was observed with incC2, which encodes a polypeptide of 259 aa that lacks the N-terminal 105 aa. Using bacterial extracts with IncC1 and IncC2 or IncC1 purified through the use of a His6 tail and Ni-agarose chromatography, we showed that IncC1 potentiates the binding of KorB to DNA at representative KorB operators. The ability of IncC to stabilize KorB-DNA complexes suggests that these two proteins work together in the global regulation of many operons on the IncP-1 genomes, as well in plasmid partitioning.
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	MRSA	OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiologic and molecular investigations that successfully contained an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). DESIGN: Isolates of MRSA were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and S. aureus protein A (spa). SETTING: A level III-IV, 45-bed NICU located in a children's hospital within a medical center. PATIENTS: Incident cases had MRSA isolated from clinical cultures (eg, blood) or surveillance cultures (ie, anterior nares). INTERVENTIONS: Infected and colonized infants were placed on contact precautions, cohorted, and treated with mupirocin. Surveillance cultures were performed for healthcare workers (HCWs). Colonized HCWs were treated with topical mupirocin and hexachlorophene showers. RESULTS: From January to March 2001, the outbreak strain of MRSA, PFGE clone B, was harbored by 13 infants. Three (1.3%) of 235 HCWs were colonized with MRSA. Two HCWs, who rotated between the adult and the pediatric facility, harbored clone C. One HCW, who exclusively worked in the children's hospital, was colonized with clone B. From January 1999 to November 2000, 22 patients hospitalized in the adult facility were infected or colonized with clone B. Spa typing and PFGE yielded concordant results. PFGE clone B was identified as spa type 16, associated with outbreaks in Brazil and Hungary. CONCLUSIONS: A possible route of MRSA transmission was elucidated by molecular typing. MRSA appears to have been transferred from our adult facility to our pediatric facility by a rotating HCW. Spa typing allowed comparison of our institution's MRSA strains with previously characterized outbreak clones.

transmission electron microscope	TEM	Phase retrieval, in principle, can be performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) using arbitrary aberrations of electron waves; provided that the aberrations are well-characterised and known. For example, the transport of intensity equation (TIE) can be used to infer the phase from a through-focus series of images. In this work an "astigmatic intensity equation" (AIE) is considered, which relates phase gradients to intensity variations caused by TEM objective lens focus and astigmatism variations. Within the paraxial approximation, it is shown that an exact solution of the AIE for the phase can be obtained using efficient Fourier transform methods. Experimental requirements for using the AIE are the measurement of a through-focus derivative and another intensity derivative, which is taken with respect to objective lens astigmatism variation. Two quasi-experimental investigations are conducted to test the validity of the solution.

temporomandibular joint	TMJ	OBJECTIVE: To study the roles of afferent sensory inputs in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and of muscle length in the modulation of the jaw-stretch reflex in humans. METHODS: Reflexes were evoked in both the masseter and temporalis muscles under standardized conditions in 11 young women. The study was performed in two sessions; experimental conditions were jaw gape and injection of local anesthetics. For jaw gape, 4, 14, and 24 mm were used in random order. One milliliter TMJ injections (carbocaine, 10 mg/ml, versus isotonic saline, 0.9%) were given in a randomized, double blind manner. When a participant received carbocaine during the first session, isotonic saline was injected during the second one. A total of 480 reflexes were evoked in every participant. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between carbocaine and isotonic saline. ANOVA and post hoc paired t tests did show, however, a significant effect of jaw gape for the left masseter and anterior temporalis muscles, with the 14 mm gape having the highest amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the afferent sensory input (including the mechanoreceptors) from the TMJ seems to have no influence on the sensitivity of the human jaw-stretch reflex. Instead, muscle spindles are the most likely receptors to be responsible for the reflex modulation that was observed in the present study.
Polygalacturonases	PGs	Polygalacturonases (PGs) have been proposed to play an important role in the process of cell separation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 69 annotated genes that by amino acid homology and transcript organization could be classified as putative PGs and these can be grouped into multiple clades. An analysis of five members located in two separate clades, using reporter fusion constructs and reverse transcription-PCR, revealed that whilst these PGs exhibit high sequence similarity they have distinct patterns of spatial and temporal expression. Sites of expression include the aleurone and endosperm cells surrounding the emerging radicle in a germinating seed, the cortical cells adjacent to the developing lateral root, the abscission zones of floral organs, the dehiscence zone of anthers and siliques, and pollen grains. Silencing of an abscission-related PG (At2g41850), using a T-DNA insertion strategy, delayed the time-course of floral organ loss but did not prevent shedding from taking place. These observations are discussed with regard to the contribution that PGs may play during the life cycle of a plant.
chronic kidney disease	CKD	BACKGROUND: Limited data exist about the effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) clinics on quality-of-care indicators in patients before initiation of dialysis. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective chart review study was conducted on all patients who initiated dialysis at the Veterans Affairs Denver Healthcare System between 2000 and 2005. Patients initiating dialysis were evaluated at the start of dialysis and 12 months after dialysis initiation, as a function of care provided by nephrologists in training (renal-hypertension clinic) vs a trained renal nurse practitioner (CKD clinic). RESULTS: Data were available for 77 patients followed in the CKD clinic and 36 in the renal-hypertension clinic. There were no major demographic differences between the cohorts at the time of clinic referral. The length of follow-up before dialysis did not differ significantly between the cohorts (10.7+/-9.8 months for the patients in the CKD clinic cohort and 13.6+/-16.0 months for the patients in the renal-hypertension clinic cohort, P=0.3299). At the initiation of dialysis, patients followed in the CKD clinic had higher haemoglobin (11.6+/-1.5 vs 10.8+/-1.7 g/dl, P=0.0239) and serum albumin (3.4+/-0.5 vs 3.0+/-0.7 g/dl, P=0.0020) concentrations. More of the CKD clinic patients had a functioning permanent vascular access (P<0.0001). The number of all-cause hospitalizations in the 12 months after initiation of dialysis was significantly lower in the CKD clinic group (P=0.0024), but no significant differences were noted in all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a single experienced renal nurse practitioner, working to a protocol, is more likely to adhere to guidelines than are multiple nephrology trainees rotating through a nephrology clinic.
chronic lymphocytic leukemia	CLL	A pilot trial of rituximab and alemtuzumab combination therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
chronic lymphocytic leukemia	CLL	The treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who fail purine analogues is sub optimal. CLL lymphocytes express two antigens, namely CD 20 and CD 52, for which monoclonal antibodies are readily available. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against CD 20, which has some activity in refractory CLL, with primary effect on nodal disease. Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD 52 antibody that is approved for the treatment of CLL in patients who fail alkylating agents and purine analogues. Alemtuzumab has better activity in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow compared to nodal disease. We investigated whether combining both antibodies is safe in refractory CLL. Both antibodies were given to a total of 12 patients divided into 3 cohorts with escalating alemtuzumab doses (3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg). The combination was proven to be safe, not toxic, feasible, and active. One patient attained PR by NCI criteria while all other patients had stable disease lasting a median of 101.5 days. All patients normalized their peripheral lymphocytosis within a median of 23.5 days. No treatment-related mortality was identified. No CMV reactivation occurred. Additional studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of such a combination in this patient population, and whether this combination can be administered safely with systemic chemotherapy. These studies are currently underway.
retinol equivalents	RE	The purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between dietary intake of vitamin A in the form of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids and the prevalence of bronchial squamous metaplasia in a sample of asbestos workers from an industrial clinic. Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 49 asbestos workers. Pulmonary function testing was done and in-person interviews were conducted to estimate dietary intake of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, tobacco exposure, and asbestos exposure. Results indicated that workers with metaplasia reported consuming a significantly lower intake of total vitamin A [2000 retinol equivalents (RE)/d] than did subjects without metaplasia (2710 RE/d, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analyses showed that higher intakes of retinol [odds ratio (OR): 0.31; 95% CI: 0.04, 2.44], provitamin A carotenoids (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.84), and total vitamin A (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.49) were associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the OR for metaplasia (highest quartile compared with lowest quartile, adjusted ORs). Current smoking (OR: 5.25; 95% CI: 0.50, 55.1) and former smoking (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 0.31, 28.1) were associated with a nonsignificant increase in the OR for bronchial metaplasia compared with never smoking. Greater airway obstruction [decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)] was associated with an increased OR for metaplasia (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.09, 7.69). These results suggest that a higher (ie, above the median) intake of vitamin A from foods decreases the risk of bronchial metaplasia in workers occupationally exposed to asbestos.

These results suggest that a higher (ie, above the median) intake of vitamin A from foods decreases the risk of bronchial metaplasia in workers occupationally exposed to asbestos.
[decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s	FEV1	The purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between dietary intake of vitamin A in the form of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids and the prevalence of bronchial squamous metaplasia in a sample of asbestos workers from an industrial clinic. Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 49 asbestos workers. Pulmonary function testing was done and in-person interviews were conducted to estimate dietary intake of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, tobacco exposure, and asbestos exposure. Results indicated that workers with metaplasia reported consuming a significantly lower intake of total vitamin A [2000 retinol equivalents (RE)/d] than did subjects without metaplasia (2710 RE/d, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analyses showed that higher intakes of retinol [odds ratio (OR): 0.31; 95% CI: 0.04, 2.44], provitamin A carotenoids (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.84), and total vitamin A (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.49) were associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the OR for metaplasia (highest quartile compared with lowest quartile, adjusted ORs).

Geographic information systems	GIS	Geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems and remote sensing have been increasingly used in public health settings since the 1990s, but application of these methods in humanitarian emergencies has been less documented. Recent areas of application of GIS methods in humanitarian emergencies include hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessments; rapid assessment and survey methods; disease distribution and outbreak investigations; planning and implementation of health information systems; data and programme integration; and programme monitoring and evaluation. The main use of GIS in these areas is to provide maps for decision-making and advocacy, which allow overlaying types of information that may not normally be linked. GIS is also used to improve data collection in the field (for example, for rapid health assessments or mortality surveys). Development of GIS methods requires further research. Although GIS methods may save resources and reduce error, initial investment in equipment and capacity building may be substantial. Especially in humanitarian emergencies, equipment and methodologies must be practical and appropriate for field use. Add-on software to process GIS data needs to be developed and modified. As equipment becomes more user-friendly and costs decrease, GIS will become more of a routine tool for humanitarian aid organisations in humanitarian emergencies, and new and innovative uses will evolve.
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome	AIDS	Six homosexual men with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC- CDC IVA/C2) were assessed with a series of neuropsychological and psychiatric tests prior to commencing treatment with zidovudine and again after 5-6 months. Significant improvements were seen in cognitive functioning, mental state and physical health at the second assessment.
gamma-aminobutyric acid	GABA	1. The effects of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine compounds on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride current (ICl) were studied in frog isolated sensory neurones by use of a concentration-jump (termed 'concentration-clamp') technique, under single-electrode voltage-clamp conditions. The drugs used were classified into four categories as follows: full benzodiazepine receptor agonists (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, midazolam, clotiazepam and etizolam), partial agonists (CL 218,872, Ro 16-6028, Ro 17-1812 and Ro 23-0364), inverse agonists (Ro 15-3505, FG 7142 and beta-CCE) and a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil). 2. All full agonists at concentrations of 3 x 10(-6) M or less increased dose-dependently the peak amplitude of ICl elicited by 3 x 10(-6) M GABA to twice to three times larger than the control. However, no further augmentation of the GABA response was observed at concentrations of 1 x 10(-5) M or higher. Partial agonists also showed a dose-dependent augmentation of the GABA response at concentrations ranging from 3 x 10(-8) M to 3 x 10(-5) M, but their efficacies of augmentation of the GABA response were only about half or less of those of full agonists. Of the inverse agonists, beta-CCE had a unique dose-dependent effect on the GABA response. Beta-CCE reduced dose-dependently the GABA response at concentrations of less than 3 x 10(-6) M, but augmented it at concentrations of 3 x 10(-5) M and 6 x 10(-5) M. The inverse agonists reduced dose-dependently the GABA response. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

embryonic day 16	ED 16	A method is presented for the isolation of defined cerebral cortical layers from the prenatal rat brain. By this procedure cells at different stages of proliferation and/or differentiation can be obtained as relatively homogeneous populations. The principle of the proposed isolation procedure consists of freezing the isolated embryonic brain in a mould which flattens the two hemispheres. The different cortical layers are then isolated by carefully cutting serial cryostat sections. On embryonic day 16 (ED 16), 3 individual layers could be sampled from the cortex: the marginal zone, the zone of DNA synthesis and the mitotic region of the ventricular germinative zone. On ED 18 and ED 20, a further 3 layers could be isolated: the cortical plate, the sub-plate region, and the intermediate zone. As an example of an application of the isolation procedure for biochemical studies, maturation-dependent changes in the protein and Concanavalin A-binding glycoprotein patterns together with the activity of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in the different cortical layers of the embryonic brain are demonstrated at different stages of brain development.
quality of life	QOL	PURPOSE: Participants' perception of quality of life (QOL) and respondent burden have significant implications for investigators' ethical responsibilities to their subjects in phase I cancer trials. To address these responsibilities, analysis was conducted on participants' views of their experiences of a phase I trial, including the associated burdens and what constitutes QOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred potential participants of the endostatin trial were surveyed. Sixteen of the 18 trial participants were interviewed extensively about their experiences on the trial. RESULTS: Participants described 'normality' as a baseline ability to function, be productive, and be free from symptoms of disease and side effects of treatment. Reflecting the relative nontoxicity of the study drug, participants contrasted their current QOL with their negative experience of previous cancer treatments and viewed their QOL as fairly good. However, participants emphasized that indirect and procedural burdens of trial participation had a significant impact on their current QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Candid descriptions of a trial's practical demands, in addition to potential physical complications in a trial, could improve the quality of informed consent.
antibiotic control programs	ACPs	Medical and surgical house physicians at three teaching hospitals with different antibiotic control programs (ACPs) were surveyed to determine their attitudes about and preferences for these programs. Questionnaires were mailed to resident physicians who had trained at all three hospitals. One hospital had no antibiotic prescribing policy (open prescribing), one employed an infectious-disease physician consultant who discussed antibiotic orders for certain reserved drugs with prescribing physicians but did not otherwise restrict access to the drugs (educational ACP), and the third hospital required approval of an infectious-disease physician for dispensing of reserved drugs by the pharmacy department (restrictive ACP). The survey response was 77% after one follow-up mailing to nonrespondents. Regardless of hospital type, physicians preferred the educational ACP to either open prescribing or the restrictive ACP. Based on personal experiences, significantly fewer physicians encountered patient-care problems with the educational ACP than with either open antibiotic prescribing or the restrictive ACP. Significantly more physicians perceived that the educational ACP was more beneficial for patient antibiotic therapy and will be more beneficial for future antibiotic prescribing than the restrictive ACP. Most respondents believed that ACPs save hospitals money, that ACPs can be implemented without compromising either patient care or physician performance, and that they would encounter similar ACPs in the future. Educational ACPs should be considered at teaching hospitals with interested infectious-disease consultants.
myocardial infarction	MI	BACKGROUND: We previously reported that depression after myocardial infarction (MI) increases the long-term risk of cardiac mortality. Other research suggests that social support may also influence prognosis. This article examines the interrelationships between baseline depression and social support in terms of cardiac prognosis and changes in depression symptoms over the first post-MI year. METHODS AND RESULTS: For this study, 887 patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at about 7 days after MI. Some 32% had BDIs > or =10, indicating mild to moderate depression. One-year survival status was determined for all patients. Follow-up interviews, including the BDI, were conducted with 89% of survivors. There were 39 deaths (35 cardiac). Elevated BDI scores were related to cardiac mortality (P=0.0006), but PSSS scores and other measures of social support were not. There was a significant interaction between depression and the PSSS (P=0. 016). The relationship between depression and cardiac mortality decreased with increasing support. Furthermore, residual change score analysis revealed that among 1-year survivors who had been depressed at baseline, higher baseline social support was related to more improvement in depression symptoms than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Post-MI depression is a predictor of 1-year cardiac mortality, but social support is not directly related to survival. However, very high levels of support appear to buffer the impact of depression on mortality. Furthermore, high levels of support predict improvements in depression symptoms over the first post-MI year in depressed patients. High levels of support may protect patients from the negative prognostic consequences of depression because of improvements in depression symptoms.

Shine-Dalgarno	SD	The purine-rich Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence located a few bases upstream of the mRNA initiation codon supports translation initiation by complementary binding to the anti-SD in the 16S rRNA, close to its 3' end. AUG is the canonical initiation codon but the weaker UUG and GUG codons are also used for a minority of genes. The codon sequence of the downstream region (DR), including the +2 codon immediately following the initiation codon, is also important for initiation efficiency. We have studied the interplay between these three initiation determinants on gene expression in growing Escherichia coli. One optimal SD sequence (SD(+)) and one lacking any apparent complementarity to the anti-SD in 16S rRNA (SD(-)) were analyzed. The SD(+) and DR sequences affected initiation in a synergistic manner and large differences in the effects were found. The gene expression level associated with the most efficient of these DRs together with SD(-) was comparable to that of other DRs together with SD(+). The otherwise weak initiation codon UUG, but not GUG, was comparable with AUG in strength, if placed in the context of two of the DRs. The +2 codon was one, but not the only, determinant for this unexpectedly high efficiency of UUG.

magnetic resonance imaging	MRI	Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to provide excellent morphological images of the body organs, particularly structures undergoing little physiologic motion. Nevertheless, the clinical usefulness of MRI has been hampered by long acquisition times, high cost of scanning because of limited patient throughput, and image artifacts due to patient motion. With recent technical developments, several ultrafast scanning techniques capable of acquiring images in a breath-hold now find their introduction into clinical use. The system improvements are potentially useful for a vast range of applications hitherto not accessible to MR imaging. Among these are functional brain imaging, realtime imaging of cardiac motion and perfusion, fast abdominal imaging, improved MR angiography, and potentially real-time monitoring of interventional procedures. Whereas some ultrafast techniques can be performed on conventional scanners, echo-planar imaging, the fastest currently available data acquisition strategy, requires specially designed hardware. This article provides an overview of the technical advances in ultrafast MRI and discusses potential applications and the possible future impact on body scanning.
Transforming growth factor beta	TGF-beta	Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) induces leukocyte recruitment and activation, events central to an inflammatory response. In this study, we demonstrate that antagonism of TGF-beta with a neutralizing antibody not only blocks inflammatory cell accumulation, but also tissue pathology in an experimental model of chronic erosive polyarthritis. Intraarticular injection of monoclonal antibody 1D11.16, which inhibits both TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 bioactivity, into animals receiving an arthropathic dose of bacterial cell walls significantly inhibits arthritis. Inhibition was observed with a single injection of 50 micrograms antibody, and a 1-mg injection blocked acute inflammation > 75% compared with the contralateral joints injected with an irrelevant isotype control antibody (MOPC21) as quantitated by an articular index (AI = 0.93 +/- 0.23 for 1D11.16, and AI = 4.0 +/- 0 on day 4; p < 0.001). Moreover, suppression of the acute arthritis achieved with a single injection of antibody was sustained into the chronic, destructive phase of the disease (on day 18, AI = 0.93 +/- 0.07 vs. AI = 2.6 +/- 0.5; p < 0.01). The decreased inflammatory index associated with anti-TGF-beta treatment was consistent with histopathologic and radiologic evidence of a therapeutic response. These data implicate TGF-beta as a profound agonist not only in the early events responsible for synovial inflammation, but also in the chronicity of streptococcal cell wall fragment-induced inflammation culminating in destructive pathology. Interrupting the cycle of leukocyte recruitment and activation with TGF-beta antagonists may provide a mechanism for resolution of chronic destructive lesions.
Gloucester Care for Elderly People at Home project	CEPH	In the United Kingdom a range of services for elderly people in the community has developed that is delivered by a variety of professionals and administered within different organisations. This has resulted in a problem of co-ordinating services to meet the individual needs of the most frail elderly people. In the United States 'case management' has been introduced as a way of improving the co-ordination of care. Despite structural differences in the provision of health and social services between the United States and the United Kingdom, the concept of case management has influenced the design of a number of innovatory schemes in the United Kingdom, including the Gloucester Care for Elderly People at Home project (CEPH). These innovatory schemes have demonstrated the need for a 'keyworker' and clarified the tasks that are involved in taking responsibility for co-ordinating services to meet the needs of elderly people at risk of failing to cope at home. There is, however, a danger of proliferating the complexity of service provision by creating a new breed of professional; an alternative might be to alter the responsibilities, attitudes and team orientation of existing professional workers so as to include taking on the keyworker role for some of their clients.
sexually transmitted disease	STD	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The advent of more sensitive diagnostic testing technologies and competition in public healthcare spending have resulted in a reevaluation of sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening practices in an attempt to target populations at greatest risk. Screening among populations with a < 2% prevalence of chlamydia and a < 1% prevalence of gonorrhea may not be cost-effective. GOAL: To identify subpopulations with a low prevalence of chlamydia or gonorrhea. STUDY DESIGN: The prevalence of genital chlamydia and gonorrhea among asymptomatic STD patients screened from 1997 to 1998 at San Francisco City Clinic was stratified by demographic and behavioral risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea was 3.4% and 1.1% among asymptomatic women and 4.0% and 1.0% among asymptomatic men, respectively. Two low-prevalence subpopulations identified among asymptomatic patients were women older than 29 years (chlamydia, 1.2%) and men who have sex with women (gonorrhea, 0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: These data identified low-prevalence subpopulations among asymptomatic STD patients. As a result, the STD screening criteria at San Francisco City Clinic were changed accordingly.
Cytochrome P450	CYP	Cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase activities with different category of substrates namely, alkanes, alkane derivatives, alcohols, aromatic compounds, organic solvents, and steroids were detected in the cells of Aspergillus terreus. High CYP specific activity was observed when methanol (5.6+/-0.017 U mg(-1)), acetone (7.76+/-0.02 U mg(-1)), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) (9.70+/-0.005 U mg(-1)), n-hexadecane (4.39+/-0.02 U mg(-1)), or n-octadecane (4.23+/-0.01 U mg(-1)) were used as substrates. Significant CYP specific activity was also detected when naphthalene (3.80+/-0.002 U mg(-1)) was used as substrate. The CYP catalysis of n-hexadecane had followed both terminal and sub terminal oxidations. The activity was localized in the cytosol of n-hexadecane grown cells, while, it was apparently distributed in light mitochondrial fraction and microsomal fraction of glucose grown cells. The substrate specificities of CYP present in all the locations were similar irrespective of the substrates used for the growth. Heme staining of the microsomal fraction containing CYP and other proteins in SDS-PAGE showed single heme protein band with corresponding molecular weight of 110 kDa.

right posterior hepatic veins	RPHV	The right posterior hepatic veins (RPHV) were investigated using the stripped specimens of 55 cadaver adult livers and the corrosion casts of portal and hepatic venous system of 45 embryos and newborns. RPHV were found in 88 livers (88%). RPHV of 6 livers (6%) was thicker than the right hepatic vein. There were 4 types of RP-HV and they could be grouped under three anatomical locations: superior, intermedial and inferior RPHV. According to our observation, RPHV with calibre more than 0.50 cm was mainly in the group of inferior RPHV (72%). RPHV in 23 (41.82%) adult livers had extrahepatic course with a Length of 1.72 +/- 0.88 cm. The application of RPHV in hepatectomy and image diagnosis was also discussed.
ileal pouch-anal anastomosis	IPAA	BACKGROUND: Pouch complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) can result in morbidity and pouch loss. Recent reports describe success with redo IPAA. This study was conducted to assess the outcome of malfunctioning pouches treated by redo IPAA. METHODS: All patients undergoing redo IPAA between 1983 and 1999 were identified and clinical records studied. Redo IPAA was defined as an operation for malfunctioning pouch with pelvic dissection and disconnection, pouch revision, and reanastomosis. Analyzed were etiology, presentation, diagnostic modalities, surgical management, pouch loss, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained by telephone or mailed survey. RESULTS: Between 1983 and 1999, 650 IPAA procedures were performed, 6 (0.9%) of which required redo IPAA. Ten referred patients required redo IPAA. These 16 cases included 7 anastomotic disruptions, 3 pouch-vaginal fistulae, 2 recurrent polyps after stapled IPAA, 2 megapouches, 1 cuff abscess, and 1 straight pullthrough. All patients underwent redo IPAA with pouch salvage 100% in this series. Twelve had the original pouch repaired and 4 new pouches. Six patients (37%) had complications and outcome was acceptable with 7.8 stools per day and nighttime incontinence "rarely" or "never" in 7 patients. Eight described results as "good," 6 as "fair.". CONCLUSION: Redo IPAA can be performed with few complications, an acceptable outcome, and should result in low pouch loss.
systemic inflammatory response syndrome	SIRS	The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to identify infected patients in the emergency room.
systemic inflammatory response syndrome	SIRS	OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the usefulness of criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) compared with the final diagnosis of infection in patients admitted to the emergency room of two university-based hospitals. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paul and Hospital General de Medellin, Medellin, Colombia. PATIENTS. Seven hundred thirty-four patients with suspected infection as main diagnosis for admittance into the emergency room. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios (LR) of SIRS criteria at admission were determined using, as gold standards, the diagnosis at the time of discharge based on clinical history and evolution, and microbiological confirmation of infection. SIRS criteria were met by 503 patients (68.5%); the discharge diagnosis of infection was found in 657 (89.4%) and 276 (37%) had microbiological confirmation. SIRS criteria exhibited a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 35%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 12% and positive LR of 1.06. There were no differences between the two gold standards. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of two or more SIRS criteria was of little usefulness for diagnosis of infection. It is necessary to work with new criteria and probably with biological markers, in order to obtain a simple, precise and operative definition of the sepsis phenomenon.

SIRS criteria exhibited a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 35%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 12% and positive LR of 1.06. There were no differences between the two gold standards. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of two or more SIRS criteria was of little usefulness for diagnosis of infection. It is necessary to work with new criteria and probably with biological markers, in order to obtain a simple, precise and operative definition of the sepsis phenomenon.

World Health Organization	WHO	INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: Medulloblastoma is a cerebellar small cell tumor, whose ancestor cell has not been yet identified in the human normal embriology: its exact origin is, in fact, still unknown. Nevertheless, one of the most acceptable possibilities facing the origin of the tumor is the remaining rests of cerebellar outer granular sheet. It is a predominantly infantile tumor, less frequent in young adults, and World Health Organization (WHO) classification has assignated grade IV of malignancy. In this publication of the WHO, medulloblastomas have been subclassified into: classic, desmoplastic, medulloblastomas with extensive nodularity and advanced neuronal differentiation and large cell medulloblastomas. Real differences dealing with survival and prognosis amidst these subvarieties have been noted in extensive series. CONCLUSION: The most frequently genetic alteration is the presence of isochromosome 17q in most of 50% of the cases.
bone mineral density	BMD	Thyrotoxicosis may cause osteopenia and lead to increased risk of fractures. From July 1988 to March 1989, 88 hyperthyroid patients and 65 age, sex matched normal controls were enrolled for lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) study. Significantly lower BMD values can be found in premenopausal hyperthyroid women (1.233 gm/cm2 vs 1.317 gm/cm2, p less than p less than 0.05). In the group of thyrotoxicosis, no linear correlation can be found between BMD and the degree of hyperthyroidism (N = 84, r = 0.01 and N = 74, r = 0.054 as comparing BMD to T4 and T3, respectively). After treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATD) for 3 months, BMD did not change significantly (1.258 gm/cm2 vs 1.242 gm/cm2, p = 0.02) in the hyperthyroid patients. Therefore, premenopausal hyperthyroid women have lower BMD than premenopausal euthyroid women. The treatment of hyperthyroidism after 3 months' course did not increase lumbar spine BMD.

hepatitis C virus	HCV	Little is known about the assembly pathway and structure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) since insufficient quantities of purified virus are available for detailed biophysical and structural studies. Here, we show that bacterially expressed HCV core proteins can efficiently self-assemble in vitro into nucleocapsid-like particles. These particles have a regular, spherical morphology with a modal distribution of diameters of approximately 60 nm. Self-assembly of nucleocapsid-like particles requires structured RNA molecules. The 124 N-terminal residues of the core protein are sufficient for self-assembly into nucleocapsid-like particles. Inclusion of the carboxy-terminal domain of the core protein modifies the core assembly pathway such that the resultant particles have an irregular outline. However, these particles are similar in size and shape to those assembled from the 124 N-terminal residues of the core protein. These results provide novel opportunities to delineate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions critical for HCV assembly, to study the molecular details of HCV assembly, and for performing high-throughput screening of assembly inhibitors.
emphysematous pyelonephritis	EPN	We conducted the study to evaluate the efficacy and roles of different imaging modalities in the diagnosis and follow-up of emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) and to correlate imaging findings with clinical outcome. Retrospective analysis of the imaging studies and clinical outcome were performed in 28 consecutive patients with EPN. They were all initially treated with CT-guided percutaneous drainage (PCD). The imaging studies performed included plain abdominal radiography (KUB) (n = 28), sonography (US)(n = 24), intravenous urography (IVU)(n = 5), retrograde pyelography (RP)(n = 20) and computed tomography (CT)(n = 28). Follow-up imaging studies included CT(n = 23) and renal scintigraphy (n = 15). The sensitivities of detecting abnormal gas in EPN on KUB and US were 66% and 88%. The mortality rate was 11%, not associated with different types, stages or renal involvement. On the follow-up CT performed within one month of PCD, type I EPN evolved into type II in 86% of the cases. On the long-term follow-up CT, renal atrophy and focal scarring were revealed in the diffuse and focal renal involvement of EPN. The mean split renal function shown on the follow-up scintigraphy was 30%. We concluded KUB and US were valuable for screening EPN, although CT was the most specific and sensitive. Follow-up CT studies not only demonstrate the response of treatment but also depict the different courses and the results of different types and renal involvement of EPN, although not associated with mortality rate.

quality of life	QOL	BACKGROUND: Psoriasis can seriously affect the quality of life (QOL) of patients and has a strong impact on social relations, psychological status and daily activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the impact of different grades of severity in psoriasis on QOL in patients in Kuwait. PATIENTS/METHODS: We used the Dermatology Quality Of Life scale (DQOLS) developed by Morgan and then validated for use in Kuwait to study a sample of 330 out-patients with psoriasis. RESULTS: Overall, physical activities were affected in greater than 50% of cases. This figure increased significantly with increased severity of psoriasis. Also, social relationships were disrupted in more than half of the patients but with no significant difference between different grades of severity. All psychological feeling items were affected by psoriasis to variable degrees. However, significant differences related to the severity of psoriasis were detected: feeling embarrassed, feeling short tempered, feeling depressed, and feeling a lack of hope. One third of cases declared their sexual activities were affected by psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Data provided should improve the physicians' awareness of the importance of patients' QOL and enhance psychological evaluation of the psoriatic patient which will promote his/her positive outcome and compliance with treatment.

hidden Markov models	HMM	Based on the manual annotation of transcription factors stored in the TRANSFAC database, we developed a library of hidden Markov models (HMM) to represent their DNA-binding domains and used it for a comprehensive classification. The models constructed were applied on the UniProt/Swiss-Prot database, leading to a systematic classification of further DNA-binding protein entries. The HMM library obtained can be used to classify any newly discovered transcription factor according to its DNA-binding domain and, thus, to generate hypotheses about its DNA-binding specificity.
neuropile glial	NG	In ion-substitution experiments supplemented by measurements of the membrane conductance, the membrane potential of neuropile glial (NG) cells in the CNS of th medicinal leech has exhibited a dependence of the external concentration of both potassium and chloride. The membrane potential was largely dependent on the external potassium concentration, as may be inferred from the change in potential as the potassium concentration of the bathing solution was changed. The external potassium concentrations had been corrected to allow for the discrepancy between intra- and extraganglionic levels found with ion-selective electrodes. A transient membrane depolarization was recorded when the chloride in the bathing medium was replaced by sulphate or glucuronate. The restoration of the normal membrane potential following the return to chloride-based saline was preceded by a transient hyperpolarization. After transfer to low-chloride solutions, the transient depolarization of the NG cell membrane was followed by a steady-state hyperpolarization. The amplitude of the steady-state hyperpolarization depended on the concentration of chloride in the bathing medium. The membrane conductance decreased in low-chloride solutions.
vitamin E-coated regenerated cellulose hollow fiber dialyzer	CL-EE	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress during hemodialysis is thought to promote the progression of vascular complications in hemodialysis patients. The protective role of vitamin E as a lipophilic antioxidant against oxidative stress has been widely investigated. Here we investigated the effects of a vitamin E-coated regenerated cellulose hollow fiber dialyzer (CL-EE) on oxidative stress compared with a polysulfone hollow fiber (CL-PS). METHODS: For at least three months before beginning the protocol, 10 nondiabetic (NDM) patients (70.0 +/- 7.5 years; 6 males and 4 females) and 8 diabetic (DM) patients (65.0 +/- 7.4 years; 4 males, 4 females) were dialyzed with CL-PS. After that, we treated all of the patients with CL-EE for six months. Malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were monitored as biomarkers for oxidative stress at the start and then at one, three, and six months into treatment with CL-EE. RESULTS: Serum MDA, AGE, and 8-OHdG levels increased after the hemodialysis with CL-PS. The increase of the biomarkers was completely prevented by a single use of CL-EE. Long-term hemodialysis with CL-EE for six months significantly reduced the basal levels of the oxidant markers at one month for AGE and at six months for 8-OHdG in both DM and NDM patients. Serum MDA was reduced in only DM patients at three months. The improvement of the oxidative stress with CL-EE was more prominent in the DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with CL-EE efficiently improves the oxidative stress associated with hemodialysis and potentially reduces dialysis complications due to oxidative stress.

glial fibrillary acidic protein	GFAp	The nervous system specific proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), S-100 and myelin basic protein (MBP) were determined in 535 human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The level of all three proteins was increased in CSF of patients with nonselective destructive central nervous tissue disease such as encephalitis, cerebrovascular disease or tumoural compression. The increases in GFAp were more constant, making it a better marker of CNS pathology. Increases in MBP in CSF of patients with acute demyelinating disease were confirmed. S-100 did not seem to give more information as GFAp. Isolated increases of GFAp could be demonstrated in patients with dementia (Alzheimer type or multi-infarct dementia) or syringomyelia. Since CNS of these patients is very rich in fibrillary astrocytes, containing large amounts of GFAp, it is suggested that GFAp is to be considered as a specific marker of fibrillary gliosis in CSF and can be used as a diagnostic tool in dementia and syringomyelia.

acute coronary syndromes	ACS	Increased cardiovascular risk in diabetes mellitus has been well-documented. In contrast, it is not widely known, that the relation between degree of hyperglycemia and mortality of diabetics or nondiabetics with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) shows a positive correlation. Insulin treatment significantly improves survival of patients with both ACS and septicemia. New onset diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance can be detected in significant proportion of patients with AMI or coronary artery disease. New onset disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism has a powerful negative influence on clinical prognosis, therefore it's early diagnosis is considered an important new challenge for clinicians. The authors discuss prognostic significance of hyperglycemia-induced macroangiopathy, postprandial blood glucose, and concomitant metabolic state, respectively, furthermore potential therapeutic role of insulin in treatment of ischemic, reperfusional, and toxic metabolic disturbances.
automatic gain control	AGC	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to gather data on the influence of compression ratio and attack and release times of slow-acting front-end automatic gain control (AGC) systems on speech understanding of cochlear implant users in various listening situations. The data should allow evaluation of the usefulness of front-end AGC in body-worn speech processors. DESIGN: Subjects were 12 experienced postlingually deafened adult users of the Med-El Combi-40 multichannel cochlear implant. Six different front-end configurations, including a linear setting, the standard AGC of the Med-El Combi-40 processor, and four slow-acting dual front-end AGCs (use of two instead of one level detector for improved transient handling), were evaluated in two experiments. In experiment 1, tests were performed at 55, 70 and 85 dB SPL, roughly corresponding to soft, medium and loud speech. Experiment 2 was intended to evaluate the quality of transient handling of the six configurations. In this experiment an intense transient ("chink") at 100 dB SPL was spliced onto the beginning of each sentence (presented at 85 dB SPL). RESULTS: At 55 dB SPL subjects performed significantly more poorly with the linear setting than with the AGC settings, but no differences in performance could be found for the AGC settings. At 70 dB SPL subjects showed the poorest performance with the high compression ratio dual front-end AGCs. No differences in performance of the six front-end configurations were found at 85 dB SPL. In the presence of intense chinks, performance of the standard AGC dropped significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that slow-acting front-end AGC can be used effectively in speech processors for cochlear implants to expand the range of input levels that are audible for the cochlear implant user, without any need to adjust a processor control, and that incorporation of an additional fast-acting AGC component can improve performance under conditions where intense transients occur.
calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate	CPPD	Pure monoclinic or triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, apatite crystals or mixtures of these crystals were injected into the synovial-like space created by the rat air pouch to compare the acute inflammation induced by these crystals. Fluids were withdrawn 6 h after injection and examined for leukocyte counts, protease, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels. CPPD crystals (especially monoclinic CPPD) induced higher numbers of leukocytes, and more protease, PGE2 and TNF than apatite. CPPD seemed to play a predominant role in the acute inflammation induced by mixed crystals.

Neurofibromatosis type 1	NF1	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities affecting multiple tissues derived from the neural crest. The peripheral neurofibromas are numerous and sometimes reach several hundred in number. In this study, the possible involvement of several growth factors in neurofibroma growth was investigated in vitro. When explants of neurofibroma tissue were cultured, macrophage-like cells with pseudopodia migrated out first, and later took on a slender fusiform shape. These cells contained S-100 protein and were identified as Schwann cells. They did not proliferate under standard culture conditions. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was helpful in maintaining the differentiated phenotype of Schwann cells, but did not stimulate their proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining for type IV collagen revealed that some large flattened polygonal cells had a mesh of type IV collagen on the surface. These cells were perineurial cells. The proliferation of cells derived from neurofibroma was stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). In comparison with skin fibroblasts, the cells derived from neurofibroma responded to these growth factors at considerably lower concentrations. Stimulation by EGF at physiological concentrations indicated the possible involvement of EGF in the development of neurofibromas.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) was helpful in maintaining the differentiated phenotype of Schwann cells, but did not stimulate their proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining for type IV collagen revealed that some large flattened polygonal cells had a mesh of type IV collagen on the surface. These cells were perineurial cells. The proliferation of cells derived from neurofibroma was stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). In comparison with skin fibroblasts, the cells derived from neurofibroma responded to these growth factors at considerably lower concentrations. Stimulation by EGF at physiological concentrations indicated the possible involvement of EGF in the development of neurofibromas.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs	NSAIDs	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to exert anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Block of angiogenesis and metastasis by NSAIDs has been found to be mediated partly via suppression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. However, the molecular mechanism of this inhibitory action has not been well defined. Recent works demonstrated that a membrane-anchored MMP inhibitor RECK may potently suppress MMP-2 and -9 activity to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we test the possibility that NSAIDs may up-regulate RECK to inhibit MMP activity. RT-PCR analyses showed that NS398 and aspirin up-regulated RECK mRNA level in CL-1 human lung cancer cells. Additionally, NSAIDs increased RECK protein level as detected by immunoblotting. Since RECK is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein, we also performed immunofluorescent staining to assess the expression of RECK on cell surface. Our results showed that fluorescent intensity of RECK was obviously increased after NSAID treatment. Moreover, induction of RECK by NSAIDs was associated with reduction of MMP-2 activity. We also found that NSAID-activated RECK expression might not be mediated via inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases (COXs) because addition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) could not counteract the effect of NSAIDs and overexpression of COX-2 could not down-regulate RECK. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of RECK expression may be one of the mechanisms by which NSAIDs suppress MMP activity to block angiogenesis and metastasis.

total knee arthroplasty	TKA	To improve patient information on the results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis, 253 primary TKAs of a prospective study with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years were analyzed. The increase or decrease of the individual variables of the Knee Society knee and function score and the percentage of operated knees in which these variables increased were determined. Improvement in pain rating had the largest increase of all variables, contributing 60% to the knee score increase. Pain improved in 95% of the knees. Alignment improved in about 90% of knees and accounted for 25% of knee score increase. Improvement in level walking contributed more to increase of function score than better stair-climbing abilities. Level walking improved in 80% of knees and stair climbing in 55%. Pain is the most rewarding indication for TKA, followed by deformity and poor walking ability. Key words: total knee arthroplasty, knee score, functional score, patient information.
Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty	DSEK	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) is rapidly becoming the preferred treatment for corneal endothelial dysfunction. Familiarity with recent advances in techniques and instrumentation can help reduce the initially steep learning curve and incidence of complications. RECENT FINDINGS: DSEK produces excellent visual outcomes with minimal change in corneal surface topography or refraction. It can successfully treat corneal dysfunction associated with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, bullous keratopathy, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome or a failed penetrating graft. Donor dissection has become automated, and new techniques have been devised to facilitate graft insertion and unfolding. Some surgeons now routinely perform DSEK with topical anesthesia. Graft detachment is the most frequent early postoperative complication, but new methods can help promote donor adherence. The incidence of graft-rejection episodes is lower after DSEK compared with standard penetrating keratoplasty, possibly because wound healing is a lesser concern, and many DSEK patients are maintained on low-dose topical steroids indefinitely. Early efforts to transplant just the endothelial cell layer show promise. SUMMARY: DSEK provides quicker visual rehabilitation and an improved safety profile compared with standard penetrating keratoplasty. Continued evolution of this relatively new technique is helping to reduce complications and further improve outcomes.
forced expiratory volume in 1s	FEV1	Loss of height occurs with ageing. This could distort the relation between height and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) as age increases. Armspan, which approximates to height at maturity, does not fall with age and might, therefore, be a better linear variable to compare with age and spirometric volumes in older people. We studied the relation between age, height, armspan and FEV1 in 150 women aged 60-91 years. The mean value of span minus height was 4.7 cm (range -5 to +17). Standardized FEV1 (SD) in 5-year age bands between 60 and 80+ fell as follows: 1.79(0.52)1, 1.62(0.49)1, 1.38(0.41)1, 1.32(0.44)1, 1.15(0.48)1. When re-standardized using armspan, the values were: 1.76(0.48)1, 1.59(0.53)1, 1.37(0.46)1, 1.29(0.47)1, 1.11(0.54)1. The differences between the two standardized values in each age band were not significant. It was concluded that span measurements offer no advantage over height measurements in cross-sectional population studies of lung volume in old age. However, in subjects who cannot have their height measured, or who are known to have lost a substantial amount of height, armspan is a reasonable substitute measure of body size from which to calculate predicted FEV1 values.

nasal polyposis	NP	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between nasal polyposis (NP) and single nucleotide polymorphisms of the proinflammatory cytokines IL (interleukin) 1alpha (the IL1A gene), IL-1beta (the IL1B gene), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (the TNFA gene). DESIGN: Prospective case-control trial. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-two patients with NP and 106 healthy volunteers without sinonasal disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genotypes of IL1A (4845G, 4845T), IL1B (-511C, -511T) and TNFA (-238G, -238A and -308G, -308A) were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses after polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The 4845 GT and 4845 TT genotypes of the IL1A gene were associated with NP (P<.05). The frequency of the -511 CC genotype of the IL1B gene was significantly higher in patients with NP than in controls (P=.01). The frequency of the -511 CT genotype of IL1B was significantly higher (P=.01) in the controls than in the patients with NP. The -238 AA genotype of the TNFA gene was higher in the patients with NP than in the controls (P=.05). There was a significantly high risk of susceptibility to NP in patients with the -308 GA genotype of TNFA (P=.001). None of the genotypes of the proinflammatory cytokines were related to sex, the presence of atopy, asthma, or aspirin intolerance (P>.05). CONCLUSION: The IL1A (4845 GT and 4845 TT), IL1B (-511 CC), and TNFA (-238 AA and -308 GA) genotypes were associated with susceptibility to NP in our study population.

electrical field stimulation	EFS	1. At least two enzymatic activities are proposed to degrade the extracellular ATP: (i) ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound enzymes (ecto-nucleotidases); and (ii) soluble (releasable) nucleotidases that are released during stimulation of sympathetic nerves and break down neuronal ATP. No quantitative data have placed the magnitude of these nucleotidase activities into a physiological perspective of neurovascular control. 2. We studied comparatively the membrane-bound and releasable nucleotidase activities in canine isolated inferior mesenteric arteries and veins using 1,N6-etheno(epsilon)-nucleotides (i.e. epsilon-ATP, epsilon-ADP, epsilon-AMP and epsilon-adenosine) as exogenous substrates. The enzymatic activities were estimated by measuring the disappearance of the epsilon-substrate and appearance of epsilon-products by means of HPLC-fluorescence detection during either stimulation of sympathetic perivascular nerves (releasable activity) or in the absence of nerve stimulation (ecto-nucleotidase activity). 3. Incubation of vascular segments with 50 nmol/L epsilon-ATP for 60 min resulted in a decrease of the epsilon-ATP substrate by 63.5 +/- 4.6 and 91.2 +/- 6.2% in the artery and vein, respectively. In contrast, the decrease of the epsilon-ATP during electrical field stimulation (EFS; 16 Hz, 0.3 msec, 2 min) was 39.8 +/- 4.2% in the artery and 13.1 +/- 7.3% in the vein. Therefore, the mesenteric arteries demonstrate a greater releasable ATPase activity and a weaker ecto-ATPase activity than mesenteric veins. 4. The degradation of epsilon-ADP and epsilon-AMP was similar in both blood vessels under either experimental protocol. The epsilon-adenosine was not significantly degraded in the absence or presence of EFS. 5. These data implicate a differential removal of extracellular ATP as a potential mechanism of serving resistance and capacitance in the splanchnic circulation.
mono-amine oxidase inhibitors	MAOIs	Narcolepsy is clinically associated with cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. It is treated by reassurance (that there is no physical disease) and by stimulants such as ephedrine and amphetamine on an intermittent basis. The special tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is also used, and mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are useful in theory. Obstructive sleep apnoea is an important and often unrecognised cause of daytime somnolence. It is treated by weight reduction (pickwickian syndrome), hormones, or recently, with continuous positive pressure apparatus. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) and sleepwalking typically occur during deep sleep (stage 3 and 4 throughout the episode) in children. In a night terror the child sits up with a scream, with eyes open, but inaccessible. He eventually falls asleep calmly. Sleepwalking, too, shows the features of inaccessibility and subsequent amnesia for the episode. Both conditions are normally treated with reassurance (to the parents) but may occasionally warrant benzodiazepines. Enuresis usually occurs in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. The reason for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is not precisely known. Delirium tremens (DT) is treated as a rebound excess of REM sleep, with benzodiazepines and other drugs. It is the withdrawal syndrome (with or without major seizures) to the barbiturate-alcohol group of drugs, which includes alcohol, chloral, paraldehyde, glutethimide, methylprylone, ethchlorvynol, meprobamate and meprobamate-diphenhydramine. Insomnia may be treated by the above drugs, by analgesics, antidepressants, major tranquillisers (neuroleptics) and miscellaneous other compounds. For the majority of patients, however, the most suitable group seems to be the benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines are much safer than their predecessors, in both acute and chronic usage.

(Surface Air System)	SAS	The Andersen six-stage impactor, the SAS (Surface Air System) impactor, the AGI-30 impinger, and gravity plates were evaluated for the retrieval of aerosol-released Pseudomonas syringae. The upper limits of the impactor samplers were exceeded at a spray concentration of 10 CFU/ml, indicating that these samplers are not appropriate for monitoring high airborne concentrations. Decreased cell concentrations were retrieved with increased sampling time for the Andersen and AGI samplers, indicating that a minimum sampling time is preferable for monitoring aerosolized vegetative cells.
intercellular tight junctions	TJ	The application of a multidisciplinary approach to study bacterial pathogenesis, along with the recent sequencing of entire microbial genomes have made possible discoveries that are changing the way scientists view the bacterium-host interaction. Today, research on the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of infectious diarrheal diseases of necessity transcends established boundaries between microbiology, cell biology, intestinal pathophysiology, and immunology. Novel multidisciplinary approaches led to the discovery of new bacteria-host cell interactions involving signals regulating intestinal permeability through the modulation of cell cytoskeleton and intercellular tight junctions (TJ). A century ago, TJ were conceptualized as a secreted extracellular cement forming an absolute and unregulated barrier within the paracellular space. Biological studies of the past several decades have shown that TJ are dynamic structures subjected to structural changes that dictate their functional status under a variety of developmental, physiological, and pathological circumstances. To meet the many diverse physiological challenges to which the intestinal epithelial barrier is subjected, TJ must be capable of rapid and coordinated responses. This requires the presence of a complex regulatory system that orchestrates the state of assembly of the TJ multiprotein network. Many pathogenic bacteria exploit this system to accomplish their pathogenic strategies by ultimately modulating intestinal permeability.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	PAHs	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals are often environmental cocontaminants, yet there have been relatively few studies of combined effects of PAHs and metals on cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed metabolism. We examined the effects of NaAsO(2) in combination with benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) on CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in T-47D human breast cancer cells by using estrogen metabolism as a probe of their activities. Exposure to BAP caused elevated rates of the 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways of estrogen metabolism, indicating induction of both CYP1A1, an estradiol 2-hydroxylase, and CYP1B1, an estradiol 4-hydroxylase. BAP-induced metabolism peaked 9 to 16 h after exposure and returned to near-basal levels by 48 h. Concentration-response studies showed maximal induction of the 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways at 3 microM BAP; higher levels caused reduced rates of metabolism due to inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. NaAsO(2) caused pronounced decreases in the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by 3 microM BAP because cotreatment with 10 microM NaAsO(2) inhibited the rates of the 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways by 86 and 92%, respectively. Western immunoblots showed diminished levels of BAP-induced CYP1A1 by coexposure to NaAsO(2). The levels of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs induced by BAP were not significantly affected by coexposure to NaAsO(2); however, heme oxygenase 1 mRNA levels were markedly induced by coexposure to BAP and NaAsO(2). These results indicate a post-transcriptional inhibitory effect of arsenite on the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in T-47D cells, possibly resulting from reduced heme availability.

micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes	MPCE	The incidence of micronucleus formation was studied at 12, 24 and 36 h post-irradiation in the polychromatic (PCE) and normochromatic (NCE) erythrocytes of the bone marrow of mice whole-body exposed to 0, 3, 9, 18, 36, 54 and 72 cGy of 60Co gamma-radiation. It was observed that the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE) increased with the increase in exposure dose at all the post-irradiation time periods studied. Similarly, the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (MNCE) also increased with the increase in exposure dose and the increase for both MPCE and MNCE was dose related. The dose-response relationship was linear-quadratic for both MPCE and MNCE. The study of mitotic index revealed that a dose as low as 9 cGy is capable of reducing the mitotic index significantly at 24 h post-irradiation and the dose response was linear-quadratic. However, no significant decline in the mitotic index was observed at 12 and 36 h post-irradiation.
micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes	MNCE	The incidence of micronucleus formation was studied at 12, 24 and 36 h post-irradiation in the polychromatic (PCE) and normochromatic (NCE) erythrocytes of the bone marrow of mice whole-body exposed to 0, 3, 9, 18, 36, 54 and 72 cGy of 60Co gamma-radiation. It was observed that the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE) increased with the increase in exposure dose at all the post-irradiation time periods studied. Similarly, the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (MNCE) also increased with the increase in exposure dose and the increase for both MPCE and MNCE was dose related. The dose-response relationship was linear-quadratic for both MPCE and MNCE. The study of mitotic index revealed that a dose as low as 9 cGy is capable of reducing the mitotic index significantly at 24 h post-irradiation and the dose response was linear-quadratic. However, no significant decline in the mitotic index was observed at 12 and 36 h post-irradiation.
interleukin-1beta	IL-1beta	BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that the Rho-kinase-mediated pathway plays an important role for coronary artery spasm in our porcine model with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). In this study, we examined whether or not Rho-kinase is upregulated at the spastic site and if so, how it induces vascular smooth muscle hypercontraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Segments of the left porcine coronary artery were chronically treated from the adventitia with IL-1beta-bound microbeads. Two weeks after the operation, as reported previously, intracoronary serotonin repeatedly induced coronary hypercontractions at the IL-1beta-treated site both in vivo and in vitro, which were markedly inhibited by Y-27632, one of the specific inhibitors of Rho-kinase. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression of Rho-kinase mRNA was significantly increased in the spastic compared with the control segment. Western blot analysis showed that during the serotonin-induced contractions, the extent of phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MBS), one of the major substrates of Rho-kinase, was significantly greater in the spastic than in the control segment and that the increase in MBS phosphorylations was also markedly inhibited by Y-27632. There was a highly significant correlation between the extent of MBS phosphorylations and that of contractions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Rho-kinase is upregulated at the spastic site and plays a key role in inducing vascular smooth muscle hypercontraction by inhibiting myosin phosphatase through the phosphorylation of MBS in our porcine model.

total mean transit time	MTT	This study evaluated the motility of interposition in patients with esophageal carcinoma after different reconstructive operations of the esophagus using an esophageal radionuclide transit test. A modified standard method was used to calculate total mean transit time (MTT), residual fraction (RF), and retrograde index (RI) in the supine position at least 6 months after the reconstructive operations of the esophagus. Eleven patients with esophagogastrostomy (EG), 7 patients with esophagoiliocolostomy (EIC), and 25 normal volunteers with a similar distribution of ages were included in this study for comparison. The values of the scintigraphic parameters in patients with esophageal reconstruction were significantly worse than in normal volunteers (P < 0.05). In addition, the MTT and RF in patients with EG were higher than in patients with EIC (P < 0.05), but no significant difference in RI was demonstrated. In conclusion, the motility of interposition became worse after reconstructive operations, but reconstruction with the colon can preserve better motility than with the stomach.

anti-human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	Twenty homosexual men [13 anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, seven anti-HIV negative] without HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc were vaccinated with three 20 micrograms doses of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. All anti-HIV-positive homosexuals were nonresponders independent of the initial number of CD4-positive cells. Among seven anti-HIV-negative individuals, five responded. After three doses of the vaccine, CD4-positive cells fell in anti-HIV positive individuals by 22.4%. A similar fall in CD4-positive cells of an average 24.9% was noted in 17 matching, but nonvaccinated, anti-HIV-positive homosexuals. The study indicates that the efficacy of vaccination in anti-HIV-positive individuals is questionable. There is, however, no evidence that vaccination against hepatitis B might be harmful to anti-HIV-positive subjects.
Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein	AAP	We show here for the first time that actin, troponin C, Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (AAP), and pro-interleukin 1 beta (pro-IL-1 beta), are substrates of the protease encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1. As has been seen in other non-viral protein substrates of the HIV protease, the presence of Glu residues in the P2' position appears to play an important role in substrate recognition. Three of the four bonds cleaved in actin, two of the three in troponin C, and all of the bonds hydrolyzed in AAP and pro-IL-1 beta have a P2' Glu residue. In fact, Glu residues are accommodated in all positions from P4 to P4' surrounding the scissile bond in substrates of the HIV proteases, and as many as 4 adjacent Glu residues were seen in one of the bonds cleaved in AAP. This study of non-viral protein substrates has also revealed unexpected amino acids such as Gly, Arg, and Glu in the scissile bond itself rather than the more conventional hydrophobic amino acids. The HIV-2 protease hydrolyzed actin in a manner similar to that of the HIV-1 enzyme, but its cleavage of troponin C was distinct in that it split a bond adjacent to a triplet of Glu residues in P2, P3, and P4 that was refractory to the HIV-1 enzyme. Documentation of cleavage sites in the several important cellular proteins noted above has extended our understanding of the features in a substrate that are recognized by these multi sub-site proteases of retroviral maturation. Moreover, the present work adds to an accumulating body of evidence which demonstrates that these enzymes can damage crucial structural and regulatory cellular proteins if ever their activity is expressed outside the viral particle itself.

Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans	TMEP	Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) is a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis observed in less than 1% of cases of mastocytosis. Clinically, anaphylaxis may appear as a result of increased mast cell degranulation in different circumstances. A case of TMEP presented as pseudoallergic reactions to foods is reported in which the appearance of typical lesions on the trunk and their histological analysis together with a negative food allergy study confirmed the diagnosis.
megavoltage cone beam computed tomography	MV CBCT	We have studied the feasibility of a low-dose megavoltage cone beam computed tomography (MV CBCT) system for visualizing the gross tumor volume in respiratory gated radiation treatments of nonsmall-cell lung cancer. The system consists of a commercially available linear accelerator (LINAC), an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device, and a respiratory gating system. The gantry movement and beam delivery are controlled using dynamic beam delivery toolbox, a commercial software package for executing scripts to control the LINAC. A specially designed interface box synchronizes the LINAC, image acquisition electronics, and the respiratory gating system. Images are preprocessed to remove artifacts due to detector sag and LINAC output fluctuations. We report on the output, flatness, and symmetry of the images acquired using different imaging parameters. We also examine the quality of three-dimensional (3D) tomographic reconstruction with projection images of anthropomorphic thorax, contrast detail, and motion phantoms. The results show that, with the proper choice of imaging parameters, the flatness and symmetry are reasonably good with as low as three beam pulses per projection image. Resolution of 5% electron density differences is possible in a contrast detail phantom using 100 projections and 30 MU. Synchronization of image acquisition with simulated respiration also eliminated motion artifacts in a moving phantom, demonstrating the system's capability for imaging patients undergoing gated radiation therapy. The acquisition time is limited by the patient's respiration (only one image per breathing cycle) and is under 10 min for a scan of 100 projections. In conclusion, we have developed a MV CBCT system using commercially available components to produce 3D reconstructions, with sufficient contrast resolution for localizing a simulated lung tumor, using a dose comparable to portal imaging.

anorexia nervosa	AN	The mean 24-hour secretion and circadian rhythm of melatonin were studied in 12 female subjects with anorexia nervosa (AN), 13 massively obese (OB) women, and 9 normal weight healthy volunteers to investigate the relationship between type of feeding behavior and hormonal secretory pattern. Blood samples for melatonin were drawn every 4 hours from 0400 h to 2400 h and every 2 hours from 2400 h to 0400 h. Mean 24-hour melatonin secretion was significantly higher in AN than in OB patients and controls. Melatonin circadian rhythms were disrupted in 8 of the 12 AN patients and in 9 of the 13 OB subjects, with phase-advanced nocturnal rises, abnormal diurnal peaks, or no nocturnal rises. The population mean cosinor analysis validated the existence of a significant circadian rhythm of the hormone in AN but not in OB subjects. No significant correlation between mean 24-hour secretion or type of circadian alterations and degree of weight deficit or excess was observed. The circadian alterations of melatonin in AN and OB may be linked to impaired secretory tonus of noradrenalin in the central nervous system, possibly unrelated to feeding patterns.

extracellular matrix	ECM	Rapid invasiveness is a feature of the highly malignant glioblastoma tumor and is closely related to patient prognosis. The interaction between extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface receptors such as integrin heterodimers play a key role in the process of tumor invasion. We investigated the effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which is a mitogenic factor for glial cells, on integrin expression in T98G human glioblastoma cells using an in vitro model 3-dimensional collagen lattice. Exogenously applied TGF-beta1 dose-dependently enhanced collagen lattice contraction. Among the inhibitory antibodies tested against alpha integrin subunits, the anti-alpha2 antibody, P1-E6, alone prevented the enhanced contractile response by TGF-beta1, whereas any alpha integrin antibody (including P1-E6) had little effect on lattice contraction when cultured without TGF-beta1. RT-PCR analysis revealed that TGF-beta1 strongly increased alpha2 integrin transcript level. Furthermore, pretreatment with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides against human alpha2 integrin using hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) liposome-mediated transfer prevented the effects of TGF-beta1 and also reduced the lattice contraction even in the absence of TGF-beta1. This data indicates that increased expression of alpha2 integrin is responsive to enhanced collagen lattice contraction by TGF-beta1. We suggest that TGF-beta1 exerts its effects on the invasive property of glioblastoma cells via upregulation of the alpha2 integrin subunit expression.

computerized transmission tomography	CTT	The authors describe an 8-year-old boy who presented with progressive oculomotor palsy on the left side. The diagnostic evaluation with computerized transmission tomography (CTT), metrizamide CTT cisternography, and angiography indicated an extra-axial tumor in the left interpeduncular cistern, extending into the suprasellar and prepontine cisterns. A meningioma was demonstrated with attachment only to the interpeduncular portion of the left oculomotor nerve. The patient was treated successfully by complete removal through a pterional approach.
steady-state plasma glucose	SSPG	AIM: To compare the insulin sensitivity indices between Chinese vegetarians and omnivores. METHODS: The study included 36 healthy volunteers (vegetarian, n=19; omnivore, n=17) who had normal fasting plasma glucose levels. Each participant completed an insulin suppression test. We compared steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG), fasting insulin, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR and HOMA %S) and beta-cell function (HOMA %beta) between the groups. We also tested the correlation of SSPG with years on a vegetarian diet. RESULTS: The omnivore subjects were younger than the vegetarians (55.7+/-3.7 vs 58.6+/-3.6 year of age, P=0.022). There was no difference between the two groups in sex, blood pressure, renal function tests and lipid profiles. The omnivores had higher serum uric acid levels than vegetarians (5.25+/-0.84 vs 4.54+/-0.75 mg/dl, P=0.011). The results of the indices were different between omnivores and vegetarians (SSPG (mean+/-s.d.) 105.4+/-10.2 vs 80.3+/-11.3 mg/dl, P<0.001; fasting insulin, 4.06+/-0.77 vs 3.02+/-1.19 microU/ml, P=0.004; HOMA-IR, 6.75+/-1.31 vs 4.78+/-2.07, P=0.002; HOMA %S, 159.2+/-31.7 vs 264.3+/-171.7%, P=0.018) except insulin secretion index, HOMA %beta (65.6+/-18.0 vs 58.6+/-14.8%, P=0.208). We found a clear linear relation between years on a vegetarian diet and SSPG (r=-0.541, P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The vegetarians were more insulin sensitive than the omnivore counterparts. The degree of insulin sensitivity appeared to be correlated with years on a vegetarian diet.
nitric oxide	NO	Streptomyces anulatus, an indicator microbe of mold in buildings, was grown on different building materials in order to study the impact of growth conditions on the ability of the spores of this microbe to induce toxicity and inflammatory responses. The microbes were grown for 2 months on sterilized and unsterilized wood, chipboard, concrete, plaster board and mineral wool in tight glass vessels under humid conditions. The highest microbial spore concentration was detected on the sterilized mineral wool followed by the sterilized plaster board and the unsterilized mineral wool. Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed in vitro for 24 h to the spores of S. anulatus and the production of the inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and cytotoxicity, were measured. The dose equivalent to 5 x 10(5) spores/ml of medium was used to compare the different materials. The most intense production of NO (11.6 microM), TNF alpha (560 pg/ml) and IL-6 (2800 pg/ml) in macrophages was induced by the spores grown on sterilized plaster board. They also caused the greatest loss of cell viability (39%). The spores grown on sterilized concrete induced significant production of NO (1.5 microM) and decreased cell viability (22%), and the spores grown on unsterilized and sterilized mineral wool increased production of NO (4.1 microM and 0.8 microM, respectively). The spores did not stimulate production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These results indicate that the ability of S. anulatus to induce inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in macrophages is dependent on the growth conditions provided by different building materials.

The most intense production of NO (11.6 microM), TNF alpha (560 pg/ml) and IL-6 (2800 pg/ml) in macrophages was induced by the spores grown on sterilized plaster board. They also caused the greatest loss of cell viability (39%). The spores grown on sterilized concrete induced significant production of NO (1.5 microM) and decreased cell viability (22%), and the spores grown on unsterilized and sterilized mineral wool increased production of NO (4.1 microM and 0.8 microM, respectively). The spores did not stimulate production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These results indicate that the ability of S. anulatus to induce inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in macrophages is dependent on the growth conditions provided by different building materials.
American Society for Testing and Materials	ASTM	Software standards simplify communication and cooperation between applications provided by different software vendors. However, adherence to a rigid standard can stifle innovation. Open standards, which are not proprietary to any particular vendor, are particularly useful. Many standard-setting organizations have provided useful tools for laboratory informatics, including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, and the College of American Pathologists. Data communication standards, such as ASTM 1238, HL7, and Digital Image Communication of Medicine, have reduced the cost and improved the timeliness of interfaces. Nomenclatures, particularly the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), have facilitated the structuring of medical information, and decision rules can be communicated with ASTM E1460. Laboratory Observation Identifier Names and Codes has eased the problem of identifying tests during interchange of laboratory data. Implementation standards are useful references for those deploying information systems. Standards have provided multiple benefits to laboratories and to the health care organizations of which they are a component.

Ultrasonographic	US	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of internal jugular vein thrombosis among patients undergoing hemodialysis in whom tunneled dialysis catheters were placed by interventional radiologists and to evaluate potential risk factors for thrombosis, such as the number of catheters inserted per patient through the right internal jugular vein, catheter type and material, total catheter days, and catheter-associated infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed by interventional radiologists in 143 patients with a history of dialysis catheter placement. The examination focused on the detection of right internal jugular vein thrombosis, with or without occlusion. Total catheter days, catheter type, and catheter-related complications, most notably infection, were evaluated with database analysis for possible association with subsequent development of thrombosis. Statistical analysis of potential risk factors was performed with logistic regression models and chi2 tests. RESULTS: Evidence of right internal jugular vein thrombosis was present in 25.9% of the patients enrolled in the study. Among the veins with thrombosis, 62% were occluded. Only the mean number of catheters placed in the right internal jugular vein per patient was significant below the level of P =.20; therefore, a multivariate logistic regression model was not used. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of internal jugular thrombosis, both complete and incomplete, was higher in the study population than previously reported. The risk factors that were analyzed demonstrated no statistically significant association with development of thrombosis.
differential scanning calorimetry	DSC	The interaction of distamycin with ColE1 DNA was examined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) taking the helix-coil transition theory of DNA into consideration. Our results here strongly indicate that the affinity of distamycin to DNA, at a low distamycin concentration, depends highly on the DNA sequence, and preferential binding occurs to the sites of four to six successive A-T pairs having two or more successive G-C pairs on both their ends.
phosphoric acid	PA	The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the surface and resin-dentine interface characteristics of permanent tooth dentine cut with diamond or carbide burs and treated with phosphoric acid (PA) or an acidic conditioner. Labial surfaces of permanent incisors were prepared into dentine with high-speed carbide or diamond burs and divided into two halves. Phosphoric acid 36% was applied on one half and non-rinse conditioner (NRC) was applied on the other half. Ten randomly selected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fields from each specimen (n = 15) were evaluated. Occlusal surfaces of third molars were divided in two halves for evaluation of the resin-dentine interface. The halves were randomly assigned to one of each conditioner and restored with Prime & Bond NT/Spectrum. Ten specimens were analysed by SEM to evaluate hybrid layer formation and interfacial seal. We observed that surfaces prepared with carbide bur presented less residual smear plugs (P < 0.05) than surfaces prepared with diamond burs. Surfaces conditioned with NRC, which is a smear layer modifier, presented more residual smear plugs than surfaces conditioned with PA (P < 0.05). Treatment with PA resulted in more sealed interfaces than specimens treated with NRC. Within the limitations of this study the results showed that carbide burs leave a surface that is more conducive to bonding than diamond burs.

eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A	eEF1A	The binding of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) to actin is a noncanonical function that may link two distinct cellular processes, cytoskeleton organization and gene expression. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have established an in vivo assay that directly identifies specific regions and residues of eEF1A responsible for actin interactions and bundling. Using a unique genetic screen, we isolated a series of eEF1A mutants with reduced actin bundling activity. These mutations alter actin cytoskeleton organization but not translation, indicating that these are separate functions of eEF1A. This demonstrates for the first time a direct consequence of eEF1A on cytoskeletal organization in vivo and the physiological significance of this interaction.
Journal of Health and Social Behavior	JHSB	As a framework for presenting ideas on developing ways to make sociology more applicable, we focus on the recent state of medical sociology research. Data for this paper were generated through a content analysis of a twelve-year period (1993-2004) of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior (JHSB) and Social Science & Medicine (SSM). The analysis aims to determine if the content of JHSB and SSM reflect the breadth of the sub-discipline of medical sociology as well as the stated goals of the journals. The selected issues of JHSB and SSM were coded on the basis of the following attributes: (1) Primary Substantive Topic, (2) Methodology, (3) Data Type and Analytic Technique, and (4) Research and Policy Recommendations. We found that the orientation of JHSB articles was towards generating research and theory that shy away from policy, interdisciplinary approaches, and applied issues. SSM content tends to display more interdisciplinary breadth and variety, but also reflects a dearth of applied recommendations. Our discussion focuses on what JHSB and SSM could be. We present ideas on how the sociological discipline in general-and JHSB and SSM in particular-can help generate and nourish new forms of inquiry that can impact the way research questions are framed. We conclude that such a shift is needed in order to maximize the applicability of social scientific evidence to everyday life, and we share examples situated within a socio-medical context, where there is a particular need for the application of social evidence to practice.

straightbred	SB	The first phase of this study was the production of contemporary straightbred (SB) and reciprocal crossbred (F1) bulls by mating Angus (A) bulls to A and Santa Gertrudis (SG) cows and SG bulls to SG and A cows. Of the bulls produced during the 4-yr period, those used for breeding included 15 A, 15 SG, 8 A X SG and 8 SG X A. For 205-d weight and weight/day of age (W/DA) postweaning, A X SG had higher (P less than .05) performance than SG X A bulls and SG had higher (P less than .05) performance than A bulls. There was no difference (P greater than .05) between SG and A X SG for 205-d weight, postweaning average daily gain (ADG) or postweaning W/DA. Heterosis estimates were 5.2 (P less than .10), 9.9 (P less than .01) and 5.8% (P less than .01) for 205-d weight, postweaning ADG and W/DA, respectively. The second phase of this study was the comparison of SB and F1 bulls for reproductive and progeny performance by exposing them as yearlings to 25 Polled Hereford cows each. There were no differences (P greater than .05) among the four sire groups for proportion of cows exposed that had a calf, had a live calf or weaned a calf. Reproductive performance of sires also was evaluated in terms of number of days (NOD) from the beginning of the breeding period until calves were born. The NOD for calves by SG was greater (P less than .05) than for calves by A or F1 sires. Compared with calves from SB sires, the NOD for calves from A X SG and SG X A sires were 5.0 and 10.6 d (P less than .05) lower. Differences among sires within year and breeding of sire were significant for all preweaning traits and for W/DA postweaning of their progeny. The SG-sired calves were heavier (P less than .05) for birth and 205-d weight and had higher (P less than .05) postweaning ADG than A-sired calves. Mean performance of calves by reciprocal F1 sires did not deviate (P greater than .05) from the mean performance of those by SB sires. Calves by A X SG sires had higher (P less than .05) 205-d weight, postweaning ADG and W/DA than calves by SG X A sires. Results indicated that the primary genetic effects responsible for differences in performance of calves sired by F1 vs SB bulls were mean transmitted and mean heterotic effects.

atrioventricular	AV	OBJECTIVE: To determine the time course of change in fast pathway refractoriness after slow pathway ablation. BACKGROUND: Antegrade fast pathway refractoriness has been observed to shorten in patients undergoing slow pathway ablation for atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia. The time course and mechanism of this observation have not been explained. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia and dual AV node pathways undergoing slow pathway ablation had the fast pathway effective refractory period (ERP) assessed immediately before, and at 0, 15, 30 and 45 mins after slow pathway ablation (Group 1). Twenty-five additional patients with AV node reentry and dual pathways involved in a multicentre protocol evaluating the Mansfield Polaris LE catheter underwent assessment of fast pathway refractoriness before and after slow pathway ablation, and at a routine three-month follow-up electrophysiology study (Group 2). RESULTS: In Group 1, antegrade fast pathway ERP fell from 394 ms before ablation to 334 ms immediately after slow pathway ablation, increased to 348 ms within 15 mins and was 353 ms at 45 mins (ANOVA P < 0.001). Retrograde fast pathway ERP fell from 325 ms before ablation to 294 ms at 45 mins (P = 0.02). In Group 2, antegrade fast pathway ERP fell from 390 ms before ablation to 337 ms after ablation, and rose to 362 ms at three months (P = 0.01). Retrograde fast pathway ERP also fell from 347 ms to 319 ms after ablation (P = 0.01), and remained unchanged at three months. CONCLUSION: Slow pathway ablation results in an immediate and sustained change in antegrade and retrograde first pathway refractoriness. There are immediate reversible and long term nonreversible components to this phenomenon. The latter finding may be related to loss of electrotonic inhibition of the fast pathway by the slow pathway.

ruminally degradable protein	RDP	The overall objective of these two studies was to evaluate the efficacy of using the proteolytic enzyme from Streptomyces griseus to estimate concentrations of ruminally degradable protein (RDP) in a wide array of forages. In the first study, alfalfa and prairie hays that previously had been evaluated in vivo for RDP were incubated in a replicated 3 x 3 factorial combination of enzyme concentrations (6.6, 0.66, and 0.066 activity units/ml of incubation medium) and incubation times (2, 4, and 48 h). Two treatment combinations (6.6 activity units for 4 h and 0.066 activity units for 48 h) yielded respective RDP estimates for alfalfa and prairie hay that were close to the known in vivo values. In the second study, 20 diverse forages were evaluated for RDP by using the in situ technique. These forages also were evaluated for RDP with the two enzyme concentrations identified in the first study, but incubation times were expanded to include 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h at the high concentration and 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 54 h at the low concentration. At the high enzyme concentration, r2 statistics from linear regressions of enzymatic estimates of RDP on corresponding estimates obtained by the in situ procedure were high (r2 > or = 0.898) at all incubation times; in addition, slopes (range = 0.88 to 1.00) and intercepts (range = -9.4 to 3.5%) approached unity and 0, respectively. At the lower enzyme concentration, r2 statistics were still good (> 0.81), but slopes (0.59 to 0.67) and intercepts (18.5 to 21.9%) for all incubation times did not meet the respective goals of unity and 0.
Helicobacter pylori	H. pylori	Emergence of drug resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has occurred in various countries and could compromise the efficacy of current treatment regimens. The aim of the study was to identify the pattern of antibiotic resistant H. pylori in Thailand and evaluate various factors associated with drug resistance. Between June 2001 and December 2002, a total of 560 dyspeptic patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were included in this study. Antral gastric biopsies were obtained for H. pylori cultures and susceptibility tests using Epsilometer test (E-test). The value of antibiotic resistant breakpoints were amoxicillin 0.5 microg/ml, clarithromycin 1.0 microg/ml, metronidazole 8 microg/ml, and tetracycline 4 microg/ml, respectively. H. pylori were detected in 315 patients using the rapid urease test (56.25%). Cultures for H. pylori were positive in 172 patients. E-test for all four antibiotics was successfully placed in 79 isolations. The prevalence of antibiotic resistant H. pylori were amoxicillin 13.9 per cent (11/79), clarithromycin 19.0 per cent (15/79), metronidazole 30.4 per cent (24/79), tetracycline 5.1 per cent (4/79), and multi-drugs 16.5 per cent (13/79), respectively. However, age, sex, or endoscopic findings did not differ between the patients with H. pylori resistant strains and sensitive strains. The emergence of antibiotic and multi-drug resistant H. pylori in Thailand were relatively high and these could compromise the efficacy of current treatment regimens. The factors associated with drug resistant H. pylori could not be demonstrated in the present study. Further study in a larger number of patients might be necessary to identify factors associated with resistant H. pylori.

log n-octanol/water partition coefficients	log P	The effects of indenolol (7.0-100 mumol/l), befunolol (15.3-250 mumol/l), metoprolol (58.4-1000 mumol/l), Ko707 (7.3-100 mumol/l), D-25 (3.7-100 mumol/l) and Ko1313 (73.9-1000 mumol/l) on action potentials were investigated in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. All these aryloxyisopropylaminopropanol derivatives produced a concentration-dependent reduction of V max at a basic rate of 1 Hz. The reduction was less prominent when interstimulus intervals were prolonged. The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz. The recovery process was approximated by a single exponential function prominent when interstimulus intervals were prolonged. The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz.

The time course of recovery of V max during diastole was studied by assessing V max in premature responses at 0.25, 0.1 and 0.027 Hz and in responses after interrupting driving stimuli of 1 Hz. The recovery process was approximated by a single exponential function. The results, together with those reported previously (Sada and Ban 1980, 1981), revealed: (1) a significant correlation between potencies of these derivatives for depression of V max at 0.027, 0.25, 1 and 5 Hz and their log n-octanol/water partition coefficients (log P): (2) The time constants of recovery were relatively concentration independent and correlated significantly with the molecular weights. The results suggest that the potency of these drugs for the depression of V max was mainly determined by log P, being modified secondarily by the time constants of recovery which are intimately associated with the molecular weights.
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide	VIP	Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) increased the cyclic AMP content of guinea pig lung and tracheal tissues. Combinations of the peptide with prednisolone or with phenoxybenzamine potentiated the effect of VIP on cyclic AMP. The trachea-relaxant effect of VIP also was reinforced by the addition of prednisolone or phenoxybenzamine. At the same time, cyclic GMP content in these tissues changed little in response to these agents. The results provide a biochemical basis for the tracheal-relaxant action of these agents, and for the potentiation of bronchodilation by prednisolone and by alpha-receptor blockade. The findings are also consistent with the view that relaxation of airway smooth muscle is mediated by an elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP.
norepinephrine	NE	By the use of high-performance liquid chromatography, the content of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) in the theca of the largest and the second largest preovulatory follicle of the ovary of the hen was found to increase from 15 h (NE) or 18 h (E) to reach a peak 9 h (NE) or 9-6 h (E) before ovulation of the largest follicle. The content of progesterone in the granulosa of these follicles and the concentration of LH in the peripheral plasma of the same hen, both of which were measured by radioimmunoassays, showed a peak 6 h before ovulation. The results suggest that the catecholamines are involved in some events occurring in both follicles some several hours before ovulation of the largest follicle during the ovulatory cycle.

potential difference	PD	Nasal potential difference (PD) measurements have been used to demonstrate defective CFTR function in cystic fibrosis (CF) and to evaluate potential CF therapies. We used the selective thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitor CFTR(inh)-172 to define the involvement of CFTR in nasal PD changes in mice and pigs. In normal mice infused intranasally with a physiological saline solution containing amiloride, nasal PD was -4.7 +/- 0.7 mV, hyperpolarizing by 15 +/- 1 mV after a low-Cl- solution, and a further 3.9 +/- 0.5 mV after forskolin. CFTR(inh)-172 produced 1.1 +/- 0.9- and 4.3 +/- 0.7-mV depolarizations when added after low Cl- and forskolin, respectively. Systemically administered CFTR(inh)-172 reduced the forskolin-induced hyperpolarization from 4.7 +/- 0.4 to 0.9 +/- 0.1 mV but did not reduce the low Cl(-)-induced hyperpolarization. Nasal PD was -12 +/- 1 mV in CF mice after amiloride, changing by <0.5 mV after low Cl- or forskolin. In pigs, nasal PD was -14 +/- 3 mV after amiloride, hyperpolarizing by 13 +/- 2 mV after low Cl- and a further 9 +/- 1 mV after forskolin. CFTR(inh)-172 and glibenclamide did not affect nasal PD in pigs. Our results suggest that cAMP-dependent nasal PDs in mice primarily involve CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance, whereas cAMP-independent PDs are produced by a different, but CFTR-dependent, Cl- channel. In pigs, CFTR may not be responsible for Cl- channel-dependent nasal PDs. These results have important implications for interpreting nasal PDs in terms of CFTR function in animal models of CFTR activation and inhibition.

bovine viral diarrhoea	BVD	Isolation of different non-cytopathogenic bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) viruses from cytopathogenic BVD virus stocks using reverse plaque formation method.
Non-cytopathogenic	NCP	Non-cytopathogenic (NCP) bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) viruses were isolated from three cytopathogenic (CP) BVD virus stocks using the reverse plaque formation method, which was based on intrinsic interference. By means of an exaltation of Newcastle disease virus (END) test, these NCP BVD viruses were divided into two groups; END phenomenon positive (END+) and END phenomenon negative (END-) viruses. Additionally, the END+ NCP BVD viruses interfered only with CP BVD virus whereas the END- NCP BVD viruses interfered with vesicular stomatitis virus as well as CP BVD virus. Differences in antigenicity existed among the three CP strains, however, each group of parent CP BVD virus and derivative NCP BVD virus was antigenically indistinguishable.

gastroesophageal reflux	GER	A number of recent studies have suggested that apnea and/or hypopnea episodes may be in a causal relationship with nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux (GER) episodes in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. In this study, we addressed the possible factors that may affect the occurrence of reflux events in OSA patients. For this reason, we investigated respiratory and sleep parameters in OSA patients with or without nocturnal GER episodes. Nineteen patients who were referred to the sleep laboratory for suspected sleep apnea were included in the study. All subjects underwent polysomnographic evaluation simultaneously with distal and proximal esophageal pH monitoring. During the recording period, a total of 134 reflux events, 134 from distal probes and none from proximal probes, were recorded. We divided patients into two groups: (1) nocturnal GER-positive patients ( n=8; age: 41.9+/-11.9) and (2) nocturnal GER-negative patients ( n=11; age: 45.4+/-3.3). We compared demographic, respiratory and sleep parameters between the two groups. Then we analysed the time relation between GER episodes and obstructive respiratory events. The two groups were matched by age and body mass index. Sleep and respiratory parameters were not different between the two groups. In conclusion, we suggested that age, body mass index and the severity of disease in obstructive sleep apnea patients are not effective determinants of gastroesophageal reflux. There is no sufficient evidence to accept arousals and obstructive apneas as primary causes of gastroesophageal reflux and vice versa. And finally, sleep macroorganisation has no impact on the occurrence of GER in OSAS.

3':5'-cyclic monophosphate),	AMP	1. The release of growth hormone from isolated fragments of rat anterior pituitary tissue incubated in vitro was studied by employing a double-antibody radioimmunoassay. 2. In the absence of added stimuli, two phases of hormone release could be distinguished, an early phase of 2h duration and a subsequent late phase. In the early phase, hormone release was rapid but could be significantly decreased by calcium depletion and by 2,4-dinitrophenol whereas the rate of release in the late phase was uninfluenced by these incubation conditions. These results have been interpreted as indicating the existence of a secretory component in the early phase of release. 3. In subsequent experiments, the effects of various agents on the rate of hormone output during the late phase of incubation were investigated. Hormone release was increased by theophylline and by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (N(6)-2'-O-dibutyryl-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate), the response to both of these agents being related to the concentration of the stimulant employed. 4. The stimulation of growth hormone output by theophylline was significantly decreased by calcium deprivation and by 2,4-dinitrophenol. The response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP was diminished by 2,4-dinitrophenol, iodoacetate and 2-deoxyglucose but not by malonate or colchicine. 5. Arginine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, albumin-bound palmitate and variation in the glucose concentration of the incubation medium over a wide range were without any statistically significant effect on the rate of hormone release from either control pituitary fragments or those subject to secretory stimulation by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. 6. It is suggested that the regulation of growth hormone secretion is mediated by cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate). The secretion observed in response to cyclic AMP requires the presence of ionized calcium and a source of metabolic energy but is independent of pituitary protein synthesis de novo. The integrity of the glycolytic pathway of glucose metabolism appears to be essential for cyclic AMP-stimulated growth hormone secretion to occur.

bispectral index	BIS	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the predictive performance of 'Servin's formula' for bispectral index (BIS)-guided propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) in morbidly obese patients. METHODS: Twenty patients (ASA physical status II-III, age 32-64 yr) undergoing bilio-intestinal bypass surgery, were recruited. Anaesthesia was induced by using a TCI of propofol with an initial target plasma concentration of 6 microg ml(-1), then adapted to maintain stable BIS values ranging between 40 and 50. A TCI of remifentanil was added to achieve pain control and haemodynamic stability. For propofol, weight was corrected as suggested by Servin and colleagues. With ideal body weight (IBW) corrected according to formula suggested by Lemmens and colleagues. For remifentanil, weight was corrected according to IBW. Arterial blood samples for the determination of blood propofol concentrations were collected at different surgical times. The predictive performance of propofol TCI was evaluated by examining performance accuracy. RESULTS: Median prediction error and median absolute prediction error were -32.6% (range -53.4%; -2.5%) and 33.1% (10.8%; 53.4%), respectively. Wobble median value was 5.9% (2.5%; 25.2%) while divergence median value was -1.5% h(-1) (-7.7; 33.8% h(-1)). CONCLUSION: Significant bias between predicted and measured plasma propofol concentrations was found while the low wobble values suggest that propofol TCI system is able to maintain stable drug concentrations over time. As already suggested before, a computer simulation confirmed that the TCI system performance could be significantly improved when total body weight is used.

fast-spiking	FS	The existence of electrical synapses between GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in neocortex is well established, but their functional properties have not been described in detail. We made whole cell recordings from pairs of electrically coupled fast-spiking (FS) or low threshold-spiking (LTS) neurons, and filled some cells with biocytin for morphological reconstruction. Data were used to create compartmental cable models and to guide mathematical analysis. We analyzed the time course and amplitude of electrical postsynaptic potentials (ePSPs), the subthreshold events generated by presynaptic action potentials, in both FS and LTS neurons. The results imply that the generation of ePSPs is predominantly a linear process in both cell types for presynaptic firing of both single and repetitive spikes. Nonlinearities shape ePSPs near spike threshold, but our data suggest that the underlying synaptic current is still a linear process. Cell-to-cell electrical signaling on longer timescales also appears to be linear. Cable models of electrically coupled FS and LTS neurons imply that the analyzed electrical synapses are, on average, within 50 mum of the soma. Finally, we show that electrical coupling between 2 inhibitory cells promotes synchrony at all spiking frequencies. This contrasts with the effect of reciprocal inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by the same cells, which promote antisynchronous firing at frequencies less than about 100 Hz. Electrical coupling counteracts the antisynchronous behavior induced by IPSPs and facilitates spiking synchrony. Our results suggest that electrical synapses among inhibitory interneurons are most readily described as low-pass linear filters that promote firing synchrony.

Electrical coupling counteracts the antisynchronous behavior induced by IPSPs and facilitates spiking synchrony. Our results suggest that electrical synapses among inhibitory interneurons are most readily described as low-pass linear filters that promote firing synchrony.
T-cell receptor	TCR	Fifty-seven cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma were studied for cell expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) chains, using monoclonal antibodies specific for the beta chain (beta F1) of the alpha/beta TCR, and for the delta chain (anti-TCR delta-1) of the gamma/delta TCR. Three different patterns were demonstrated: in 39 cases (69%), the phenotype (CD3+beta F1+TCR delta-1-) was that of most normal T cells. A second pattern was found on six cases (10%), which were of CD3+beta F1-TCR delta-1+ phenotype, and in which DNA analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of the delta locus in the five cases studied. It is suggested that these cases are the neoplastic counterpart of the small subpopulation of normal T cells that express gamma delta receptor. It is of considerable interest that these gamma delta lymphomas had unusual clinicopathologic presentations, as one case corresponded to a lethal midline granuloma and the five others to hepatosplenic lymphomas with a sinusal/sinusoidal infiltration in spleen, marrow, and liver. The fact that the distribution of the neoplastic gamma delta cells in the splenic red pulp resembles that of normal gamma delta cells reinforces the concept of a preferential homing of gamma delta T cells to this tissue. A third pattern (CD3 +/- beta F1-TCR delta-1-) was seen in 12 cases (21%), in which, by contrast to normal post-thymic T cells, no evidence of either alpha beta or gamma delta T cell receptor was found.
P-glycoprotein	Pgp	OBJECTIVE: Membrane transporters are proteins that play a crucial role in resistance to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of membrane transporter protein expression on chemotherapeutic response. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and forty seven samples of tumor tissue were collected from 143 patients; 35 samples were obtained by bronchoscopy and 112 were surgical specimens. A total of 101 samples from 99 patients were adequate for study. Cryopreserved samples were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis to detect 3 proteins associated with multidrug resistance: P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug-resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and lung resistance protein (LRP). RESULTS: In 16 cases none of the proteins were expressed. A single protein was expressed in 32 (3 Pgp, 11 MRP1, and 18 LRP); 2 in 34 cases (24 Pgp and LRP; 5 MRP1 and Pgp; 5 MRP1 and LRP); and all 3 in 17 cases. No significant relationship was found between age and the expression of Pgp (P=.74), MRP1 (P=.95), or LRP (P=.26). Nor were there significant differences in number (P=.72) or type of coexpressed proteins (P=.39) by sex, by tumor stage (number, P=.55; type, P=.21), or by tumor grade (number, P=.59; type, P=.51). There was a highly significant trend toward coexpression of Pgp and LRP (P< .01) but not of Pgp and MRP1 (P=.18) or MRP1 and LRP (P=.26). MRP1 was expressed less often in adenocarcinoma. LRP was expressed less often in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated large cell carcinoma. Coexpression of Pgp, MRP1, and LRP was observed most often in squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Proteins associated with multidrug resistance are commonly expressed in lung cancer. Of the 3 proteins studied, LRP was the one most often found. Coexpression of more than 1 of the proteins was found in a considerable percentage of patients. Pgp was mainly found to be coexpressed with LRP. Pgp expression and the number of coexpressed proteins seemed to have a negative impact on response to chemotherapy.

Down syndrome	DS	We compared the hematologic parameters of 18 otherwise healthy children with Down syndrome (DS) in the age range of 2-6 years to those of 18 healthy non-DS controls matched for age and gender. The children with DS had MCVs and hematocrits increased significantly compared to controls and decreased WBCs compared to controls; 66% of the children with DS compared to 11% of non-DS controls had MCVs greater than the 97th percentile for age (P < 0.0001); the mean MCVs were 86.9 and 80.6, respectively. Although hematocrits were within normal limits for age for all DS and non-DS subjects, the DS patients had significantly higher hematocrits (39.1% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.014). We also found that 33% of the children had WBCs < 5% for age compared to 6% of controls. To determine whether folate deficiency contributed to these observations, we measured serum and RBC folate concentrations: these were not significantly different between the 2 groups. We conclude that macrocytosis and leukopenia are common in children with DS.
basement membrane nephropathy	TBMN	The prevalence of this basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) may be approximated from the known frequencies of glomerular hematuria in the population, and from the prevalence of autosomal-recessive Alport syndrome and its known relationship to TBMN. These approaches confirm that TBMN affects more than 1% (but < 10%) of the population, making it the commonest inherited renal disease, and one of the commonest conditions affecting the kidney after infections, hypertension, and stones. TBMN is the most frequent cause of persistent glomerular hematuria. Although we do not advocate mass screening for hematuria to detect TBMN, we strongly support investigating hematuria that is discovered incidentally. Individuals with TBMN and isolated hematuria should be evaluated initially by a nephrologist and subsequently reviewed by their family doctor. Those with proteinuria, hypertension, or renal impairment are at risk for progressive renal impairment and should by examined carefully for features of Alport syndrome or an additional glomerular or tubulointerstitial lesion, undergo a renal biopsy examination, be treated symptomatically, and be monitored by a renal physician.
electrocardiographic	ECG	OBJECTIVES. The study evaluates the association between T wave alternans and the risk of cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest or cardiac death) in a large population of patients with idiopathic long QT syndrome. BACKGROUND. T wave alternans is an infrequently recorded electrocardiographic (ECG) finding in patients with delayed repolarization, and its clinical significance is not clear. METHODS. A total of 4,656 ECG recordings in 2,442 patients enrolled in the International Long QT Syndrome Registry were reviewed for episodes of T wave alternans. To determine the risk associated with T wave alternans, independent of corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, patients with T wave alternans were matched for QTc value (every 0.025 s1/2) to patients with long QT syndrome without T wave alternans. RESULTS. T wave alternans was identified in 30 patients (25 of whom had a QTc interval > 0.50 s1/2). A strong association between QTc prolongation and T wave alternans was observed (odds ratio 1.23 per 0.01-s1/2 unit increase in QTc, p < 0.0001). Conditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age, gender, status and QTc value revealed that T wave alternans did not make a significant independent contribution to the risk of cardiac events. The risk of experiencing a major cardiac event was primarily related to length of QTc. CONCLUSIONS. T wave alternans, a marker of electrical instability and regional heterogeneity of repolarization, identifies a high risk subset of patients with prolonged repolarization. Patients with T wave alternans have an increased risk of cardiac events, but this risk is primarily related to the magnitude of repolarization delay (QTc prolongation). T wave alternans does not make an independent contribution to the risk of cardiac events after adjustment for QTc length.
Embryonic stem	ES	Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been investigated in many animal models of injury and disease. However, few studies have examined the ability of pre-differentiated ES cells to improve functional outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of murine ES cells that were pre-differentiated into GABAergic neurons or astrocytes on functional recovery following TBI. Neural and astrocyte induction was achieved by co-culturing ES cells on a bone marrow stromal fibroblast (M2-10B4) feeder layer and incubating them with various mitogenic factors. Rats were initially prepared with a unilateral controlled cortical contusion injury of the sensorimotor cortex or sham procedure. Rats were transplanted 7 days following injury with approximately 100K GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, fibroblasts, or media. Animals were assessed on a battery of sensorimotor tasks following transplantation. The stromal fibroblast cells (M2-10B4), as a control cell line, did not differ significantly from media infusions. Transplantation of GABAergic neurons facilitated complete and total recovery on the vibrissae-forelimb placing test as opposed to all other groups, which failed to show any recovery. It was also found that GABAergic neurons reduced the magnitude of the initial impairment on the limb use test. Histological analysis revealed infiltration of host brain with transplanted neurons and astrocytes. The results of the present study suggest that transplantation of pre-differentiated GABAergic neurons significantly induces recovery of sensorimotor function; whereas, astrocytes do not.

blood pressure	BP	In urban Australia, the risk of retiring with hypertension is greater than 40%, and the basic abnormality--a rise in blood pressure (BP) with age--is almost universal. A hypothesis linking this with salt, therefore, concerns everyone. The diet of early humans was unsalted, and the Na content of breast milk (6 mmol/kg) shows how little NaCl is needed even during the most rapid period of growth. The hypothesis that the hypertonic concentration needed to preserve food causes the BP to rise with age is based partly on the normotensive status of contemporary "salt-free" societies and partly on experimental evidence. "Salt-free" populations seldom use alcohol and happen to be lean and active, with a low fat intake and largely vegetarian diet, but Westerners with similar virtues do not escape hypertension. Ideally, the prophylactic effect of avoiding salt would be ascertained in large-scale, prospective trials, but practical, ethical and, economic factors impose serious design problems. Nevertheless, a public health intervention based on this hypothesis would be incomplete without a serious attempt to measure the outcome.
Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides	USPIOs	Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIOs) are a class of MRI contrast agents having moderately selective affinity for the reticuloendothelial cells of lymph nodes and bone marrow. This study evaluated a USPIO preparation, Combidex (Code 7227), in MRI of a rabbit bone tumor model. VX2 carcinoma implanted into the tibial marrow of nine subject rabbits was studied. After tumor growth, the subjects underwent MRI of their lesions both before and after intravenous administration of Code 7227. Code 7227 was judged subjectively to conspicuously reduce the signal intensity of normal marrow on some pulse sequences. A hypointense zone outlined the tumor margins on postcontrast imaging, which allowed improved visualization of the soft tissue component of the larger lesions. Accumulation of the contrast agent in a zone of inflammation outside the tumor margin was demonstrated on histologic sections of the lesions. Code 7227 deserves additional study as a potential contrast agent for MRI of bone tumors.
fluorescence in-situ hybridization	FISH	Microdissection in combination with reverse painting fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) is a very effective method to identify breakpoints and rearrangements of derived chromosomes and reveal the chromosomal origin of marker chromosomes. We describe an influorescence in-situ hybridizationnovation that allows a convenient, fast and safe isolation of microdissected fragments as currently available protocols. The microdissected chromosomes are harvested in a collection drop located in a movable micropipette adjusted to a second micromanipulator under microscopic observation. We used this technique to analyze several cytogenetic aberrations. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our microdissection procedure, we compared the results obtained with microdissection probes made from only one fragment with those obtained with more than six microdissected fragments. In all cases, the single-fragment microdissections were sufficient to provide probes.
fair adjustments	trades	To stress a point made earlier, whether backyard or Little League, the tone of the youth sports experience is greatly influenced by the player and team selection process. All possible steps should therefore be taken to ensure that the draft is held on high moral ground, and that the adult participants, even on the Major Little League level, behave cooperatively rather than competitively. If it is the community's hope that Little League will "build character, and not characters," it must embrace Shields and Bredemeier's work and flood the Draft Room with the four virtues of compassion, fairness, sportspersonship, and integrity. In one attempt to achieve fairness and balance, some leagues enter player evaluations into a data base and allow a properly programmed computer to project equal teams. It might be best, however, to borrow a page from backyard baseball, and make team selection a more cooperative venture. Wolff has proposed such a draft model. He recommends that each child's name be placed on a big blackboard at the beginning of the draft. All assembled give their assessment of each child's baseball ability, and a consensus skill-level number (one through five) is entered next to each player's name. If there are 72 names, and the league wishes to form six teams of 12 players each, dividing up the rated players so that the skill levels balance would assure everyone (coaches, parents, the league, and by extension, the community) that the teams were of relatively equal strength. No coach at this point would know to which team he or she was being assigned, so there would be no motive for "stacking" a given team. Each team would be designated by a letter of the alphabet, and the six letters would be thrown into a hat. The six coaches would then blindly pick a team from the hat. If a coach desired that his or her child play on his or her team, fair adjustments (trades) could be made subject to majority agreement. The three draft models can be summarized as follows: Draft Model 1 Public tryouts Previous year rating Coach makes selections Can be very competitive, lacking in "character" Can result in very unequal teams Draft Model 2 Player evaluations placed into a data base Properly programmed computer projects equal teams Draft Model 3 All names placed on a blackboard Relative merits of players discussed Equal team drawn up and placed into a hat Adjustments can be made for coach's child If practical, this author suggests that coaches not pick a name for the team until the first team meeting or practice, when that task can be given to the children. In a symbolic way, this returns some of the sport to them while encouraging social interaction among new teammates, and helping the coach detect who the leaders are. Names of professional teams in the major sports, especially baseball, are to be avoided, as they fuel longstanding unconscious associations and fantasies, and may subtly tilt all participants toward the professional "win at all costs" mentality. No one draft model is perfect for every town, and even the most ethical attempt to achieve balance among teams can be severely tested by parents who request that their athlete be placed on the same team as another child for social or car pool reasons. Such requests are not inviolate, however. For example, they do not usually dictate placement in school classes, and car pools are frequently disrupted when children, in individual sports such as Tae Kwan Do, reach different ability levels, and so attend practices at different times. Baseball is no longer the national pasttime and, as we approach the millennium, American children have too many other attractive, competing interests and time demands to spontaneously organize a pick-up game. One coach shared with the author that his saddest moment in CAP League came when he arrived at 6 PM at a field that had been "reserved" for his team, and found a group of boys who were playing a pick-up game. The coach's impulse was to set his boys fre
glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase	GOT	Thioacetamide (400 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) was administered to rats. After 12 h the activity of plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and after 24 h plasma GOT and GPT activities strongly increased. These results indicated that the necrotic process was initiated at about 12 h and developed thereafter. By co-administration of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 18 and 1 h before, and 8 h after administration of thioacetamide: each time, 2.5 ml/kg body weight, p.o.), plasma GOT and GPT were significantly decreased and were even comparable to the control group, showing that DMSO totally prevented the necrotic action of thioacetamide. After 12 and 24 h of thioacetamide administration, the hepatic level of vitamin C, the most sensitive chemical indicator of oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating that oxidative stress was significantly enhanced 12 h after thioacetamide intoxication and thereafter. DMSO totally restored the liver vitamin C level, demonstrating that DMSO effectively ameliorated the oxidative stress caused by thioacetamide, resulting in the prevention of necrosis of the liver. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased transiently 12 h after treatment with thioacetamide. These results indicated that oxidative stress and the activation of JNK took place almost simultaneously. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 was significantly increased 6-12 h after thioacetamide injection. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) was significantly decreased 24 h after administration of thioacetamide. DMSO treatment inhibited the change of these MAPKs by thioacetamide, corresponding with the prevention of the liver necrosis as well as the attenuation of oxidative stress.

isopropyl thiogalactoside	IPTG	Our previous study has indicated that p53 gene mutation occurred in 73% of human functional adrenal tumors, and the mutation hot spots were focused on codons 100, 102 (exon 4), and 249 (exon 7). Furthermore, a transcriptional activity study revealed that the mutant p53 protein derived from human functional adrenal tumors lost 90% transcriptional activity and the ability to bind with the p53 sequence. In order to investigate the influence of the mutant protein extracted from adrenocortical tumors on normal adrenal cells, we first cloned p53 cDNA from the human primary aldosteronism and constituted it with isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) inducible expression vector as recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was then transfected to normal bovine adrenocortical cells through electroporation. The results showed that the p53 protein mutations at codons 100 and 102 could neither affect the cell morphology nor enable cell growth on the soft agar. In addition, no significant difference was found in cortisol level between the p53 transfected and the control cells. On the other hand, cell morphological changes and cell proliferation rate increase were observed when we used IPTG to induce the expression of the p53 protein, which mutated at codon 249, in adrenocortical cells. The cell morphology changes included less flattened and decreased elongation when compared to non-transfected cells. However, the cortisol level in transfected cells was not affected by the p53 mutants. Taken together, we concluded that the mutant p53 protein indeed participates in adrenal carcinogenesis; however, it has no influence on hormone production and secretion.
substance P	SP	1. The tachykinin receptors mediating contraction of isolated longitudinal strips of the guinea-pig oesophageal body were characterized with substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) as well as the analogues, [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP, [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and [MePhe7]NKB, selective for NK1, NK2 and NK3, receptors, respectively. Experiments were performed both in the absence and presence of a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors, captopril (1 microM), thiorphan (1 microM) and amastatin (20 microM), in order to determine whether membrane bound proteases are important in the metabolism of tachykinins in this preparation. 2. All agonists produced concentration-dependent contractile effects. The presence of the peptidase inhibitors shifted the concentration-response curves of SP, [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and [MePhe7]NKB significantly leftwards and the concentration-response curve of NKB was shifted significantly rightwards. However, the EC50 values were significantly different only for [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and NKB. 3. In the presence of the peptidase inhibitors, the EC50 values of the selective agonists, [MePhe7]NKB (0.6 nM) and [Nle10]NKA(4-10) (66 nM) indicated the presence of both tachykinin NK3 and NK2 receptors. [MePhe7]NKB produced less than 50% of the maximal response obtained with the other agonists. Since [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP produced a small response in the nanomolar concentration range in about 30% of the preparations tested, it is possible that some NK1 receptors were also present. 4. Assuming competitive antagonism, the NK2-selective antagonist SR 48,968 (30 nM) gave apparent pKH values of 8.13 and 8.65 for [Nle10]NKA(4-10) in the absence and presence of peptidase inhibitors, respectively, supporting the presence of NK2 receptors. 5. The NK3-selective antagonist SR 142,801 (0.1 microM), suppressed responses to low (0.1-10 nM) concentrations of [MePhe7]NKB. These contractile responses to [MePhe7]NKB were also abolished by atropine (0.6 microM) suggesting that this response was mediated via cholinergic nerves. 6. It is concluded that the guinea-pig oesophagus is a complex system which has both NK2 and NK3 receptors and possibly some NK1 receptors as-well.
neurokinin A	NKA	1. The tachykinin receptors mediating contraction of isolated longitudinal strips of the guinea-pig oesophageal body were characterized with substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) as well as the analogues, [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP, [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and [MePhe7]NKB, selective for NK1, NK2 and NK3, receptors, respectively. Experiments were performed both in the absence and presence of a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors, captopril (1 microM), thiorphan (1 microM) and amastatin (20 microM), in order to determine whether membrane bound proteases are important in the metabolism of tachykinins in this preparation. 2. All agonists produced concentration-dependent contractile effects. The presence of the peptidase inhibitors shifted the concentration-response curves of SP, [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and [MePhe7]NKB significantly leftwards and the concentration-response curve of NKB was shifted significantly rightwards. However, the EC50 values were significantly different only for [Nle10]NKA(4-10) and NKB. 3.

anisidine	AMSA	Phase II evaluation of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m--anisidine (AMSA) in patients with advanced head and neck cancers.
4-(9-Acridinylamino)	AMSA	4-(9-Acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisidine (AMSA) was evaluated in 26 patients with advanced head and neck cancer in a phase II study. All patients were previously treated with one or combinations of the three modalities, namely, surgery, radiation treatment, or chemotherapy. Among the 23 evaluable patients, 2 achieved a partial response, 4 a minimal response, 9 with stable disease, and 8 with disease progression. Side effects were mainly granulocytopenia with mild GI symptoms. AMSA may have activity in recurrent squamous cell cancers of the head and neck and further evaluation in previously untreated patients or combination of AMSA with other chemotherapeutic agents should be considered.
upbeat nystagmus	UBN	Two cases of vertical gaze nystagmus, which were influenced by posture are reported. In both cases, upbeat nystagmus (UBN) on forward gaze in upright and supine positions changed to downbeat nystagmus (DBN) in prone position. Convergence had no influence on the vertical nystagmus. A CT scan revealed an atrophy of the anterior vermis of the cerebellum in the first case. The UBN of the second case was suspected to be associated with lesions in the brachium conjunctivum. The authors concluded that both UBN and DBN were not completely separate, but they could coexist in cases with certain lesions in the posterior cranial fossa.

chronic hemodialysis	HD	OBJECTIVE: The influences of alexithymia and social support on depression among chronically ill patients were examined prospectively. METHODS: The study population was 230 outpatients receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD) therapy. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and two subscales of the Social Support Questionnaire were given to the subjects. The BDI-II was readministered after a 6-month interval, and subjects who showed deterioration in their depression score above the level predicted from their baseline score were identified. Multivariate logistic analysis adjusted for age, gender, cause of dialysis, and psychosocial variables were performed. RESULTS: Baseline depression was significantly and independently associated with alexithymia and low satisfaction with available support. Deterioration of depression after 6 months was predicted by alexithymia and poor available support. CONCLUSIONS: Alexithymia and reduced social support might have independent associations with the presence and the prognosis of depression among HD patients.

enterochromaffin	EC	Ultrastructural characterization has been performed on eosinophilic granular cells occurring in gastric carcinomas. Of these, the present paper dealt with enterochromaffin (EC)-type cells. EC-type cells were identified by the presence of eosinophilic granules, immunoreactivity for serotonin (5 HT) and argentaffinity. Conventional electron microscopy revealed that they bore membrane bound, electron-dense granules of varying size (100-800 nm in shorter diameter), which were larger than those of normal EC cells. Their shapes are round, rod-shaped and concave. The granules are immunolabeled for 5HT by both pre- and post-embedding methods. The preembedding method also disclosed diffuse cytosolic immunoreactivity. Both differentiated-type and undifferentiated-type gastric carcinomas showed essentially the same results. General trends of occurrence of Paneth-like and EC-type cells in gastric carcinomas were also discussed. The present study confirmed that EC-type cells in gastric carcinoma retained basic characteristics of EC cells despite of morphological deviation from the normal cells. It is speculated that they are derived from neoplastic precursor cells with a special differentiation.
high NaCl diet	HNa	This study was performed to investigate the influence of repeated psychological stress alone or combined with high NaCl intake on the function of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition, NPY levels have been measured in brain regions of potential importance in the central regulation of stress responses (ventrolateral and dorsomedial medulla, paraventricular and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and frontal cortex). Normotensive Wistar rats received a standard diet alone or supplemented with NaCl. To accentuate differences in sodium balance, rats on the high NaCl diet (HNa) were uninephrectomized. Half the animals on each diet were subjected to chronic stress using daily sessions (1 h) of immobilization stress. After 12 days, plasma levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (E) were measured basally and in response to acute footshock stress. HNa intake or chronic stress alone did not significantly alter either basal or stimulated plasma levels of NPY. However, combining the treatments produced a significant interaction, increasing the NPY response to footshock by 31% compared to HNa alone (p = 0.039) and by 98% compared to stress alone (p less than 0.001). Chronic stress increased basal levels of NE and enhanced the response to subsequent acute stress: combining the treatments did not yield further increases. Plasma levels of E were not significantly affected by the treatments. In the brain, stress alone had no effect on the NPY levels in the structures studied. HNa intake induced a significant increase in NPY levels of the arcuate nucleus, and produced a significant interaction with stress in the dorsomedial medulla. In a supplementary experiment, to evaluate the role of the autonomic nervous system in plasma NPY responses, treatment with the ganglion blocker hexamethonium was shown to significantly attenuate stress-induced changes in NPY, NE, and E.

nitric oxide	NO	Measurement of nitrite and nitrate, the stable oxidation products of nitric oxide (NO), provides a useful tool to study NO synthesis in vivo and in cell cultures. A simple and rapid fluorometric HPLC method was developed for determination of nitrite through its derivatization with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN). Nitrite, in standard solution, cell culture medium, or biological samples, readily reacted with DAN under acidic conditions to yield the highly fluorescent 2,3-naphthotriazole (NAT). For analysis of nitrate, it was converted to nitrite by nitrate reductase, followed by the derivatization of nitrite with DAN to form NAT. NAT was separated on a 5-microm reversed-phase C18 column (150X4.6 mm, I.D.) guarded by a 40-microm reversed-phase C18 column (50x4.6 mm, I.D.), and eluted with 15 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50% methanol (flow-rate, 1.3 ml/min). Fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 375 nm and emission at 415 nm. Mean retention time for NAT was 4.4 min. The fluorescence intensity of NAT was linear with nitrite or nitrate concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 2,000 nM in water, cell culture media, plasma and urine. The detection limit for nitrite and nitrate was 10 pmol/ml. Because NAT is well separated from DAN and other fluorescent components present in biological samples, our HPLC method offers the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity as well as easy automation for quantifying picomole levels of nitrite and nitrate in cell culture medium and biological samples.

N-bromosuccinimide	NBS	Treatment of spinach leaf ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductase with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), under conditions where slightly less than 1 mol of tryptophan is modified per mole of nitrite reductase, inhibits the catalytic activity of the enzyme by ca. 80% without any effect on substrate binding or other enzyme properties. Complex formation between nitrite reductase and ferredoxin completely protects the enzyme against this inhibition. Transient kinetic measurements show that the second-order rate constant for reduction of NBS-modified nitrite reductase by reduced ferredoxin is approximately four-fold larger than that observed for the native, unmodified enzyme. Also, reduction of NBS-modified nitrite reductase by the 5-deazariboflavin radical shows a different kinetic pattern than that observed with the native enzyme, suggesting that tryptophan modification increases access of the radical to the low-potential [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme, decreases the accessibility to the siroheme group of the enzyme, or both. The tryptophan that is modified has been identified as the absolutely conserved W92. A methionine, M73, that is also modified by NBS, has been identified. The ferredoxin-binding site on spinach nitrite reductase thus appears to include W92 and perhaps M73, in addition to the previously identified R375, R556, and K436.
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor	G-CSF	We sought to determine the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as an adjunct therapy in high-dose cytarabine-containing chemotherapy (HD C/T) for children with acute leukemia. Seventeen patients, aged 9 months to 18 years old, 8 ALL and 9 AML, were treated with cytarabine (Ara-C) 1 g/m2 q12h for 8 doses with mitoxantrone, idarubicin, VP-16, or asparaginase. A total of 71 courses of HD C/T was given. G-CSF was not used in 14 courses (Group A). Prophylactic G-CSF was given in 57 courses (Group B) as 200 microg/m2/d SC started one day after the completion of HD C/T and continued until the neutrophil recovery was maintained. The incidences of sepsis per course in Group A and Group B were 35.7% (5/14) and 40.4% (23/57), respectively. While 2 patients in Group A died of sepsis or pneumonia, none in Group B died. The mortality and delay in chemotherapy were fewer in Group B (P = 0.037 and 0.0006, respectively, Fisher exact test). There was a shorter average number of days of neutrophil <500/cumm, antibiotic usage, fever, and hospital stay in Group B (11, 8, 5, 17 days in Group B vs. 21, 17, 10, 37 days in Group A; P = 0.0001, log-rank test; 0.0006, 0.0023, 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively). The incidence of neutropenic fever was lower in Group B, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06, Fisher exact test). We conclude that G-CSF as an adjunct therapy in HD C/T is effective in reducing mortality, days of neutropenia, antibiotic usage, fever, hospital stay, and frequency of delay in chemotherapy. The efficacy of this treatment approach requires further testing in a randomized, controlled trial.

high risk human papilloma virus	HPV	The presence of high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18 was examined in 100 oral cancer patients of Indian descent, 80 patients with potentially malignant oral lesions and corresponding clinically normal mucosa from 48 of these patients. Additionally, presence of HPV-33, -6 and -11 was also studied in 86 oral cancers, 50 potentially malignant oral lesions and 30 corresponding normal oral mucosa. All the patients with oral cancer and oral lesions, were long term tobacco-chewers, and a majority of the patients were in Advanced Stages III and IV. The DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using HPV L1 consensus primers. Typing of HPV was performed by Southern hybridization analysis of the PCR products using HPV-16, -18, -33, -6 and -11 type specific oligonucleotide probes. HPV-16 was detected in 15 out of 100 (15%) oral tumours, 27 out of 80 (34%) potentially malignant lesions and 15 out of 48 (31%) of the corresponding normal mucosa in the patients with oral lesions. HPV-18 was not detected in any of the oral cancers, oral lesions and normal mucosa. HPV-33 and the low-risk HPV-6 and -11 were also not detected in the oral cancers, oral lesions and corresponding normal mucosa. A significantly higher prevalence of HPV-16 was observed in oral lesions (27 out of 80, 34%) as compared to oral cancers (15 out of 100, 15%). The observed difference of 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6%, 31%), between these two proportions was statistically significant at the 5% level of significance. Our data indicates that HPV-16 may play a direct role in a certain proportion of oral cancers; whereas in a subpopulation of oral cancers HPV-16 infection may be vital in the early events associated with development of potentially malignant oral lesions, and the presence of the virus not essential in the progression of the oral lesion to frank malignancy.

Additionally, presence of HPV-33, -6 and -11 was also studied in 86 oral cancers, 50 potentially malignant oral lesions and 30 corresponding normal oral mucosa. All the patients with oral cancer and oral lesions, were long term tobacco-chewers, and a majority of the patients were in Advanced Stages III and IV. The DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using HPV L1 consensus primers. Typing of HPV was performed by Southern hybridization analysis of the PCR products using HPV-16, -18, -33, -6 and -11 type specific oligonucleotide probes. HPV-16 was detected in 15 out of 100 (15%) oral tumours, 27 out of 80 (34%) potentially malignant lesions and 15 out of 48 (31%) of the corresponding normal mucosa in the patients with oral lesions. HPV-18 was not detected in any of the oral cancers, oral lesions and normal mucosa. HPV-33 and the low-risk HPV-6 and -11 were also not detected in the oral cancers, oral lesions and corresponding normal mucosa. A significantly higher prevalence of HPV-16 was observed in oral lesions (27 out of 80, 34%) as compared to oral cancers (15 out of 100, 15%). The observed difference of 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6%, 31%), between these two proportions was statistically significant at the 5% level of significance.

cyclin-dependent kinases	cdks	One strategy in the development of anticancer therapeutics has been to arrest malignant proliferation through inhibition of the enzymatic activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which are key regulatory molecules of the cell cycle. Over the past few years, numerous compounds with remarkable cdk inhibitory activity have been studied in cancer therapy, although it is very difficult to point out the best cdk to target. An excellent candidate appears to be cdk2, whose alteration is a pathogenic hallmark of tumorigenesis. The small molecule described in our study showed an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of cdk2, a significant growth arrest observed in a colony formation assay and a reduction in the size of the tumor in nude mice, thus suggesting its potential role as a promising new type of mechanism-based antitumor drug, also for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders.
serum response factor	SRF	Serum-regulated transcription by serum response factor (SRF): a novel role for the DNA binding domain.
Serum Response Factor	SRF	The transcription factors Serum Response Factor (SRF) and Ternary Complex Factor (TCF) form a ternary complex at the c-fos Serum Response Element (SRE). We show that in NIH3T3 cells TCF binding is required for regulated transcription in response to stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but not by whole serum. We constructed a novel transcriptionally inactive SRE variant whose serum-regulated activity can be partially restored by overexpression of SRF in the absence of bound TCF. Activation by SRF does not require the SRF N-terminal phosphorylation sites, but is potentiated 2- to 3-fold by the SRF C-terminal activation domain. Mutations in the SRF DNA binding domain, which do not affect the ability of SRF to bind DNA, abolish its ability to mediate TCF-independent serum-regulated activation and reduce activation by the SRF/TCF(Elk-1) ternary complex. Efficient activation requires that SRF be targeted to DNA via its own DNA binding domain.

phenobarbital	PB	The influences of age, dose and comedication on the dose-level relationship were investigated using the ratio of plasma level to dose per body weight (microgram/ml/mg/kg/day) as an index in patients who had received the therapeutic doses of antiepileptic drug(s) for a long term. Samples of the blood concentrations were taken from 1,922 patients ranging in age from one to 40: 1,567 measured values were obtained under medication with phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproate (VPA) alone, and 2,201 under medication with any two of the above-mentioned antiepileptic drugs. With regard to PB, PHT, CBZ and VPA, when used alone, the L/D ratio was the lowest in the youngest age group, increased toward the latter half of teens, reached a peak at about age 20 and slightly decreased in the rest between the 20s and 30s. The age when the L/D ratio changes with aging is consistent with the age when the body weight of children obviously increases. As a result, during such a term, the fairly constant blood concentration can be maintained without overtly changing the daily dose. In the same age group given a single antiepileptic drug, the L/D ratio for PHT steeply increased at the dose of 4 in adults or 5 mg/kg/day in children, while the ratio rather decreased for CBZ and VPA. Clinical considerations should be paid to the fact that there was a non-linear relationship between the dose and the plasma concentration not only of PHT but of CBZ and VPA, and that the turning points were all within the range of therapeutic doses.

volatile organic compounds	VOC	The concentrations of selected air quality parameters in aircraft cabins were investigated including particle numbers in cabin air compared to fresh air and recirculation air, the microbiological contamination and the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The Airbus types A310 of Swissair and A340 of Lufthansa were used for measurements. The particles were found to be mainly emitted by the passengers, especially by smokers. Depending on recirculation filter efficiency the recirculation air contained a lower or equal amount of particles compared to the fresh air, whereas the amount of bacteria exceeded reported concentrations within other indoor spaces. The detected species were mainly non-pathogenic, with droplet infection over short distances identified as the only health risk. The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were well below threshold values. Ethanol was identified as the compound with the highest amount in cabin air. Further organics were emitted by the passengers--as metabolic products or by smoking--and on ground as engine exhaust (bad airport air quality). Cleaning agents may be the source of further compounds.

Industrial Epidemiology Forum	IEF	This article examines current ethics guidelines for recommendations on advocacy as an acceptable activity for epidemiologists. Three sets of guidelines, those produced by the Industrial Epidemiology Forum (IEF), the International Epidemiological Association (IEA), and the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), appear to endorse the role of advocate, although there are differences in their recommendations. The IEF guidelines hint that advocacy is appropriate, the IEA guidelines recommend separating the roles of scientist and advocate, and the CIOMS guidelines recommend advocacy dependent on the quality of epidemiologic research and on causal interpretations of the data. Advocacy in the form of public health recommendations can be justified in terms of the principle of beneficence found in the guidelines, but is a central obligation only if the aims of the profession are enlarged to include not only the study of disease but also a commitment to disease prevention. An important issue in women's health--alcohol and breast cancer--provides an illustrative example.

stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha	SDF-1alpha	The binding of chemokines to glycosaminoglycans is thought to play a crucial role in chemokine functions. It has recently been shown that stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), a CXC chemokine with potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity, binds to heparan sulfate through a typical consensus sequence for heparin recognition (BBXB, where B is a basic residue KHLK, amino acids 24-27). Calculation of the accessible surface, together with the electrostatic potential of the SDF-1alpha dimer, revealed that other amino acids (Arg-41 and Lys-43) are found in the same surface area and contribute to the creation of a positively charged crevice, located at the dimer interface. GRID calculations confirmed that this binding site will be the most energetically favored area for the interaction with sulfate groups. Site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance-based binding assays were used to investigate the structural basis for SDF-1alpha binding to heparin. Among the residues clustered in this basic surface area, Lys-24 and Lys-27 have dominant roles and are essential for interaction with heparin. Amino acids Arg-41 and Lys-43 participate in the binding but are not strictly required for the interaction to take place. Direct binding assays and competition analysis with monoclonal antibodies also permitted us to show that the N-terminal residue (Lys-1), an amino acid critical for receptor activation, is involved in complex formation. Binding studies with selectively desulfated heparin, heparin oligosaccharides, and heparitinase-resistant heparan sulfate fragments showed that a minimum size of 12-14 monosaccharide units is required for efficient binding and that 2-O- and N-sulfate groups have a dominant role in the interaction. Finally, the heparin-binding site was identified on the crystal structure of SDF-1alpha, and a docking study was undertaken. During the energy minimization process, heparin lost its perfect ribbon shape and fitted the protein surface perfectly. In the model, Lys-1, Lys-24, Lys-27, and Arg-41 were found to have the major role in binding a polysaccharide fragment consisting of 13 monosaccharide units.
Marek's disease virus	MDV	In earlier studies, a revertant serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV), clone Md11/75C/R2, was found to be a highly protective vaccine virus but was mildly pathogenic for susceptible chickens. The term "revertant" indicates that the virus, after attenuation, gained virulence following backpassage in chickens. The present study is an attempt to develop a more attenuated but still protective vaccine virus from Md11/75C/R2. Forty-two derivative viruses or clones from Md11/75C/R2 were evaluated. Two of these, designated clones R2/23 and R2/29, induced viremia but little or no pathology in preliminary trials and were selected for further study. In a series of nine trials, both clones provided protection against challenge with very virulent MDV strains that was superior to that induced by turkey herpesvirus (HVT) and was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from that induced by a bivalent (HVT + SB-1) vaccine. Both clones appeared fully attenuated based on pathogenicity tests in susceptible antibody-negative chickens. Both clones gained virulence on backpassage in chickens, but this seemed of little concern because neither virus spread by contact to other chickens. Although the two clones were very similar, clone R2/23 appeared to have a slightly lower pathogenic potential following backpassage and thus best meets the combined criteria of safety and efficacy.
Bacterial vaginosis	BV	Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was identified recently as a cofactor that promotes sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study was done to determine if interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha could be measured consistently in cervical secretions and if high levels of these cytokines were associated with BV. Secretions were obtained from 209 study subjects; most samples had detectable levels of TNF-alpha (84.2%) and IL-1beta (79.8%). BV was detected in 53 (27.0%) of 196 women. High cytokine levels were significantly associated with BV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-10.30), oral contraceptive use (AOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.04-7.48), and high leukocyte counts on vaginal smear (AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36). Since these cytokines could up-regulate local HIV replication through activation of the long terminal repeat promoter region, the association of BV with high levels of IL-1beta or TNF-alpha may partly explain the mechanism by which this risk factor enhances HIV transmission.

25-hydroxycholecalciferol	25-OH-CC	One hundred and four children aged 0-15 years, with suspicion of malabsorption were studied. They had a proximal jejunal biopsy and, at the same time, the following measurements: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-CC), calcium, phosphorus and serum alkaline phosphatase, bone age on X-ray of the left hand and wrist, cortical thickness of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th metacarpal bones. For the analysis of the results, the patients were divided into two groups according to the season (winter vs. summer). None of the patients in either group had clinical or radiological signs of rickets. The following results were obtained: 1. The 25-OH-CC serum levels were significantly lower during the winter than during the summer months. This was observed more frequently in the cases with atrophy of the jejunal mucosa. 2. During the summer, the 25-OH-CC serum levels were not different in the cases with normal or pathological mucosa. This demonstrates the importance of the skin synthesis of vitamin D during the summer months. 3. The mean of the serum calcium levels was significantly lower in the group of children with atrophy of the jejunal mucosa than in children with normal intestinal biopsy. The serum calcium levels were not correlated with the serum 25-OH-CC levels. 4. The serum phosphorus levels were significantly lowered during the winter months in the children aged 0-3 years with pathological jejunal biopsy. 5. The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were lowered in cases of total atrophy of the jejunal epithelium cells. 6. Cortical thickness of the metacarpal bones becomes thinner with the progression of the alteration of the jejunal epithelium cells, independently of season or age. However, only the group of children aged 0-3 years studied during the winter months and with total atrophy of the jejunal mucosa have a significantly diminished cortical thickness of the metacarpal bones. The lowering of the calcium levels and the decrease of the cortical thickness are probably secondary to an impaired intestinal absorption of calcium. In the syndrome of malabsorption, the integrity of the jejunal epithelial cells seems to play a more important role than a vitamin D deficiency in the genesis of this calcium malabsorption.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma	MTC	Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs as a sporadic form or, less frequently, as an autosomal dominant inherited familial disorder. Germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are found in most of the familial cases (nearly 95%). Somatic mutations in sporadic MTC are detected in 23-69% of patients. The most frequent somatic mutation is located in exon 16 at codon 918, and only a small percentage of mutations are found in exons 10, 11, 13, and 15. We have searched for somatic mutations in Czech MTC patients using direct sequencing. We report here two new somatic missense mutations in exon 16 of the RET proto-oncogene associated with the sporadic MTC detected in two Czech men. A homozygous mutation at codon 922 TCC(Ser)-->CCC(Pro) as a result of loss of heterozygosity was revealed in the first patient. In the second one a heterozygous mutation at codon 930 ACG(Thr)-->ATG(Met) was found.
intensive care unit	ICU	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to analyse the results of early postoperative extubation following oesophagectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who had undergone oesophageal resection between 1994 and 2001 were identified from a prospectively collected database. Their records were then reviewed in order to analyse morbidity and mortality along with intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilatory requirements. All patients were extubated immediately following surgery and monitored on a surgical high dependency unit (HDU). RESULTS: A total of 98 resections were undertaken (76 men; mean age, 64.3 years; range, 40-80 years). Surgical procedures were Ivor-Lewis (71), left thoraco-abdominal (15) and transhiatal (12) oesophagectomies. Overall, 8 patients died and 13 patients had anastomotic leaks. Sixteen patients required ventilation and admission to ICU, of whom 5 died. Three patients died on HDU following an elective decision not to transfer to ICU. Reasons for ventilation and ICU admission were anastomotic leaks (6), respiratory problems (6), left ventricular failure (1), cardiac arrest (1), small bowel herniation through the hiatus (1) and ischaemic stomach requiring revision of anastomosis (1). No patient required ventilation and admission to ICU within 48 h of original surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing oesophageal resection can be safely managed on a surgical HDU without routine postoperative ventilation. Although ventilation and ICU will be required in a significant number due to postoperative complications, this is unlikely to occur in the first 48 h. The requirement for an ICU bed to be available on the day of surgery should, therefore, no longer be considered necessary. This has important implications for the scheduling of elective oesophageal surgery.

3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine	DiI	BACKGROUND:: Flap necrosis caused by inadequate blood supply is a common postoperative complication in reconstructive surgery. Because a putative stem cell population within the adipose tissue has been found to possess angiogenic potential, the authors sought to determine whether these cells might selectively induce neovascularization and increase the viability of random pattern skin flaps. METHODS:: Adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from the inguinal fat pads of ICR mice and expanded ex vivo for three passages. After the elevation of cranially based random pattern skin flaps (3 cm long and 1 cm wide), 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI)-labeled adipose-derived stem cells were then injected into the pedicle base (group A) or 1.5 cm distal to the pedicle (group B). Medium containing no adipose-derived stem cells, mature adipocytes, or basic fibroblast growth factor were injected in three other control groups separately. (n = 10 for each group). Millimetric measurements were taken at postoperative day 7 for evaluation of flap viability. Specimens were harvested for histologic analyses. RESULTS:: Adipose-derived stem cells led to a statistically significant increase in flap viability in both group A and group B compared with the control and the adipocyte groups. Histologic examination also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in capillary density in both group A and group B. Moreover, some of the endothelial cells were stained positively for DiI. CONCLUSIONS:: These findings suggest that adipose-derived stem cells have a potential for enhancing the blood supply of random pattern skin flaps. This mechanism might be both the direct differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells into endothelial cells and the indirect effect of angiogenic growth factor released from adipose-derived stem cells.
food restriction	FR	Male Wistar rats with continuous access to 6% ethanol solution and water in their home cages were subjected to food restriction (FR). Reduction of body weight to 80% of normal was associated with a significant increase in ethanol drinking. It is known that the stress of FR gives rise to increased corticosterone secretion, and in line with these findings it was found that the weight of the thymus (whose size is inversely related to corticosterone levels) was reduced to 55% of normal in the present FR rats. Two subsequent experiments indicated that this adrenal activation contributed to the FR-induced enhancement of alcohol drinking. Firstly, adrenalectomized rats showed no evidence of enhanced alcohol drinking during food restriction, suggesting that adrenal corticosterone hypersecretion contributes to the enhanced ethanol consumption during FR. Secondly, treatment of FR rats with the enzyme inhibitor cyanoketone, which blocks stress-induced but not basal corticosterone secretion, at least partly prevented the FR-induced increase in ethanol drinking. These results add further evidence that sustained exposure to corticosterone facilitates ethanol consumption in the rat.
Tamoxifen	TAM	Tamoxifen (TAM) is a synthetic non-steroidal anti-estrogen compound that is widely used as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Unfortunately, prolonged treatment with TAM causes TAM-responsive tumors to become TAM resistant through an as-yet-unknown mechanism. To develop novel anti-breast cancer agents that are therapeutically superior to TAM, we must first fully understand the biological effects of TAM. In this study, we found that TAM treatment of MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells activated p21Waf1/Cip1 gene transcription independently of p53. Furthermore, TAM-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity was enhanced by transient expression of the gene encoding Early Growth Response-1 (Egr-1) protein, a transcription factor that plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. The TAM-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity was blocked by the expression of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to Egr-1 mRNA. In addition, induction of Egr-1 expression by TAM occurred at the transcriptional level via Ets-domain transcription factor Elk-1 through the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase signals inhibited Egr-1-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity. We conclude that TAM stimulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 gene transcription in MDA-MB-361 cells depends largely on Elk-1-mediated Egr-1 expression induced by activation of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways.

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus	PRRSV	This review highlights some of the interactions between alveolar macrophages and human/swine influenza A viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), bovine parainfluenza type-3 (PI-3) virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). In influenza A infection, macrophage-cytokines are believed to mediate the typical constitutional effects and inflammation in the respiratory tract. The same cytokines possibly play a role in influenza-bacterial respiratory disease. PRRSV has a very restricted tropism for alveolar macrophages. The virus causes some secondary infections to be more severe, but this could not be related to impaired macrophage functions. Bovine RSV and PI-3 virus, on the other hand, interfere with selected macrophage functions. In addition, PI-3 virus adversely affects lymphocyte proliferation because it interferes with the accessory role of macrophages. One of the characteristic effects of BVDV on monocytes-macrophages is stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production.

intraocular pressure	IOP	We compared the effect of Occucoat (2% hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose), Viscoat (sodium hyaluronate-chondroitin sulfate), and Healon (sodium hyaluronate) on postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) and endothelial cell damage. One hundred fourteen patients having planned extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation using a viscomaterial were prospectively randomized into one of five groups. Group I received Occucoat which was removed from the anterior chamber at the conclusion of surgery. Group II received Occucoat which was not removed (retained). Group III received Viscoat which was removed, Group IV received Viscoat which was retained, and Group V received Healon which was removed. No prophylactic ocular hypotensive medications were given. Intraocular pressure was measured at four hours, 24 hours, one week, one month, three months, and one year postoperatively. Compared to preoperative IOP, all groups had a significant IOP increase at four hours. All but the Viscoat removed group (Group III) showed a statistically significant increase at 24 hours postoperatively (P less than .05). No group had a significant increase at one week or later. Specular microscopy showed no significant difference in cell loss between any of the groups at three months or within each group when compared to preoperative cell counts (P greater than .1).
low-altitude natives	LAN	Serum aldosterone, cortisol, and electrolyte concentration, and urinary aldosterone and electrolyte excretion responses were examined in seven low-altitude natives (LAN) (373 m or less, aged 19-25 yr) and nine moderate-altitude natives (MAN) (1,830-2,200 m, aged 19-23 yr) for 2 d at their own residence (home) altitude (PB 740 or 585 mm Hg, respectively) and later for 2 d during decompression at a simulated altitude of 4,270 m (PB 447 mm Hg). The LAN group demonstrated higher (p less than 0.05) serum cortisol concentrations and respiration rates, and lower (p less than 0.05) serum aldosterone and potassium, and urinary aldosterone, sodium, and potassium concentrations at certain times during decompression compared to their home responses. Moderate-altitude native responses, on the other hand, were generally unchanged. Manifestations of acute mountain sickness at PB 447 mm Hg were also significantly greater in the LAN group. Thus, it appears that the MAN subjects were influenced less by the drop in ambient oxygen tension associated with PB 447 mm Hg.

suprachiasmatic nuclei	SCN	In aperiodic rats with lesions in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), rhythms with a circadian period in spontaneous locomotion, wheel-running, feeding, drinking, body temperature and plasma corticosterone were restored by chronic administration of methamphetamine. These rhythms were not entrained by a light-dark cycle. Wheel-running, feeding and drinking rhythms in individual rats were in phase in terms of ultradian bout as well as circadian fluctuation. Rhythms of the intraperitoneal temperature appeared accompanying the spontaneous locomotor rhythm. The phase relation between the two rhythms was similar to that of SCN dependent rhythms. Plasma corticosterone also fluctuated in a circadian fashion. The corticosterone peak preceded the activity onset of locomotor rhythm by a few hours, which was similar to the phase relation observed in the SCN intact animals. It is concluded that the oscillatory mechanism underlying the spontaneous locomotor rhythm in SCN lesioned and methamphetamine treated rats drives also other physiological rhythms. The phase-relations among them were similar to those of rhythms driven by the circadian pacemaker in the SCN.
Epstein-Barr virus	EBV	A case of encephalomyelitis with polymerase chain reaction detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the CSF, and concurrent serologic changes consistent with acute systemic EBV infection is presented and discussed. We document involvement of the brain, spinal cord, and nerve roots, summarize some unusual imaging findings, and note the evolution of CSF oligoclonal bands.
Clear cell ependymoma	CCE	BACKGROUND: Clear cell ependymoma (CCE) is an uncommon central nervous system tumor with a predilection for the supratentorial region in children. Histologically, it may mimic oligodendroglioma, central neurocytoma, hemangioblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features, therapy, and outcome in 10 children with CCE who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (1984-2003). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using 1p/1q, 19p/19q, CEP18/DAL1, and bcr/NF2 probe pairs. RESULTS: The median patient age at diagnosis was 7.5 years (range, 1-19 years). Tumors occurred supratentorially in 9 of 10 patients. All tumors had rounded nuclei with surrounding, clear halos and at least focal perivascular pseudorosettes. Seven tumors had anaplastic features. No deletions involving 1p, 19q, or NF2 were detected. The tumors from 5 of 7 patients, all with anaplasia, had losses of both CEP18 and DAL-1. Radiographically, all tumors were enhanced, and 9 tumors had associated cysts with enhancing walls. Seven patients underwent gross total resection, which was near total in one patient and subtotal in two patients. Five patients received immediate postoperative local radiotherapy. Three patients were diagnosed initially with pilocytic astrocytoma (one patient) and oligodendroglioma (two patients) and were observed. The progression-free survival and overall survival rates at 5 years were 34% +/- 20% and 75% +/- 19%, respectively. The median follow-up was 37 months (range, 5-239 months). Five patients developed local recurrence within a median of 9 months after diagnosis. Two patients developed extracranial soft tissue and lymph node metastases. CONCLUSIONS: CCEs were found to have a predilection for extraneural metastases and early recurrence and demonstrate characteristic radiographic features, anaplastic histologic features, and chromosome 18 losses. The authors recommend resection followed by local radiotherapy as the treatment of choice in children.

pulsed dye laser	PDL	EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a new topical anesthetic composed of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine in an oil-in-water emulsion cream. It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children. However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment. We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment. One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment. The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA. The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site. We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment.

generalized anxiety disorder	GAD	BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram, a newer SSRI, with paroxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: Patients with DSM-IV-defined GAD were randomized to receive 24 weeks of double-blind flexible-dose treatment with either escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) or paroxetine (20-50 mg/day), followed by a 2-week, double-blind, down-titration period. Mean change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores was the primary efficacy variable. RESULTS: Mean baseline HAMA scores for the escitalopram (N = 60) and paroxetine (N = 61) groups were 23.7 and 23.4, respectively. After 24 weeks of treatment, mean changes in HAMA scores were -15.3 and -13.3 for escitalopram and paroxetine, respectively (p = 0.13). Significantly fewer patients withdrew from escitalopram than paroxetine treatment due to adverse events (6.6% vs. 22.6%; p = 0.02). The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher with paroxetine vs. escitalopram: overall (88.7% vs. 77.0%), insomnia (25.8% vs. 14.8%), constipation (14.5% vs. 1.6%), ejaculation disorder (30.0% vs. 14.8%), anorgasmia (26.2% vs. 5.9%), and decreased libido (22.6% vs. 4.9%). Conversely, diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported more with escitalopram than paroxetine (21.3% vs. 8.1%, and 14.8% vs. 4.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of escitalopram as a first-line treatment for GAD.

radial arteries	RA	This paper was designed to evaluate the effectivity of several vasodilators, applied topically, to attenuate the hyperreactivity of radial arteries (RA) implanted as aorto-coronary bypass. Remnant segments of the RA were obtained from 20 operations, and each of the segments was divided into 4 rings. The rings were incubated for 30 minutes in control conditions (n = 20) or in presence of 30 microM of Diltiazem (DILT, n = 6), 30 microM of mibefradil (MIBE, n = 4) or a mixture of 30 microM of verapamil + 30 microM of nitroglycerin (VP-NTG, n = 6). A subsequent exposure to KCl 80 mM (in absence of vasodilators) evoked a sustained contraction in control rings, which was attenuated by 35 +/- 9% by DILT, 48 +/- 13% by VP-NTG and by 69 +/- 20% by MIBE (p < 0.05). Preincubation with vasodilators also attenuated the rate and intensity of rhythmic contractions of the RA. In rings that were cold-stored during 24 hs and then restimulated with KCl 80 mM the depressing effect was still evident: DILT 53 +/- 6%, VP-NTG 46 +/- 14% and MIBE 61 +/- 9% (p < 0.05). The effect of MIBE was more intense and persistent than that of DILT or VP-NTG, even at concentrations eliciting a similar initial depression of contraction. It is concluded that the exposure to vasodilators during a period equivalent to the duration of the surgical preparation of the RA produces an attenuation of the arterial reactivity that might provide an additional protection against RA spasm during the immediate postoperative period.
Diltiazem	DILT	This paper was designed to evaluate the effectivity of several vasodilators, applied topically, to attenuate the hyperreactivity of radial arteries (RA) implanted as aorto-coronary bypass.

cowan I	SAC	Expression of the IL-4 receptor was studied in a highly purified population of human B-lymphocytes stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus, cowan I (SAC). Flow cytometric analysis showed that incubation with SAC in the absence of detectable levels of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 resulted in a striking increase in cellular binding of IL-4. The SAC-stimulated B-cells responded to exogenous IL-4 by DNA synthesis. This response was unaffected by CsA or prednisolone, but was inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil.
wastewater treatment plants	WWTPs	The efficiency of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Catalonian region to remove several classes of ionic and non-ionic surfactants was investigated, using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Occurrence and distribution of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LASs), coconut diethanol amides (CDEAs), nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) and their degradation products were studied in coastal areas receiving WWTP effluents. For the analysis of sediment samples pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by SPE extract clean-up and LC-MS detection was used for simultaneous extraction of all target compounds. Concentrations of parent long ethoxy chain NPEOs in raw water entering WWTPs ranged from 60 to 190 microg/L. In effluents concentrations ranged from 2.8 to 6.6 microg/L, which corresponded to an average primary elimination of 93-96%. Nonylphenol (NP) was found in concentrations from 0.2 to 18 microg/L in WWTP influents and up to 5 microg/L in the treated water, showing a clear declining trend with respect to concentrations reported in the last 5 years. The elimination of LASs and CDEAs varied depending on the WWTP and was higher than 85% in well operated WWTPs with secondary treatment and only 56% (for CDEAs) and 30% (for LAS) in WWTPs with primary treatment. Levels up to 86 mg/kg of LAS, 1.7 mg/kg of NP, 400-760 microg/L for NPEOs and NPECs were detected in sediments at sampling points near the discharge of WWTP effluents, clearly showing that in coastal area receiving WWTP effluents surfactants and their degradation products are widespread contaminants.

Division of Toxicology, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry	ATSDR	The Division of Toxicology, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has a Congressional mandate to develop toxicological profiles for chemicals of greatest concern at hazardous waste sites. These chemical profiles provide a comprehensive evaluation and interpretation of the health effects, chemical and physical properties, production and use, potential for human exposure, analytical methodologies, and regulations and advisories for those chemicals. In addition, these profiles identify critical gaps in the knowledge base for these chemicals and identify levels of significant human exposure. Health assessors and other public health officials use this information to make critical decisions regarding the potential for adverse health effects at hazardous waste sites and other chemical-release events through such activities as public health assessments, chemical-specific and health-specific consultations, health-guidance-value derivations, database development, and emergency response actions. In a previous paper, we provided an overview of six specific public-health activities conducted by the ATSDR Division of Toxicology and examined how these activities have made unique impacts on public health policy and service. In this paper, we follow up on two of these, ATSDR polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) activities and ATSDR mercury activities, and examine their long-term, continually evolving impacts on public health policy and service.

cytotoxic T lymphocyte	CTL	Previous reports have indicated that both dendritic cells and macrophages have the ability to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper (Th) cell responses in vivo. Dendritic cells process exogenous antigens conventionally for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. However, unconventional processing of exogenous antigens in vitro for presentation on MHC class I molecules is still an open question. In this study, we report that a cloned dendritic cell line (D2SC/1) is able to present cell debris-associated exogenous viral proteins to MHC class I-restricted CTL in vitro. The dendritic cell line was very efficient in processing recombinant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV NP) and presenting the class I-restricted epitope to CTL primed in vivo. Peritoneal macrophages could also process the recombinant LCMV NP for subsequent MHC class I presentation, but were less efficient compared to the dendritic cells. Furthermore, recombinant yeast-derived virus-like particles carrying the HIV-1 V3 loop (V3-VLP), which are protenaceous and do not contain any lipid, were also found to be efficiently processed by the dendritic cell line for presentation of the class I-restricted epitope. These results clearly indicate that viral proteins, in particulate form or associated with cell debris, are processed by dendritic cells for CTL induction.

truncus arteriosus	PTA	Previous studies have demonstrated that TGFbeta induces a smooth muscle fate in primary neural crest cells in culture. By crossing a conditional allele of the type II TGFbeta receptor with the neural crest-specific Wnt1cre transgene, we have addressed the in vivo requirement for TGFbeta signaling in smooth muscle specification and differentiation. We find that elimination of the TGFbeta receptor does not alter neural crest cell specification to a smooth muscle fate in the cranial or cardiac domains, and that a smooth muscle fate is not realized by trunk neural crest cells in either control or mutant embryos. Instead, mutant embryos exhibit with complete penetrance two very specific and mechanistically distinct cardiovascular malformations--persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) and interrupted aortic arch (IAA-B). Pharyngeal organ defects such as those seen in models of DiGeorge syndrome were not observed, arguing against an early perturbation of the cardiac neural crest cell lineage. We infer that TGFbeta is an essential morphogenic signal for the neural crest cell lineage in specific aspects of cardiovascular development, although one that is not required for smooth muscle differentiation.
computed tomography	CT	Antenatal ultrasonic findings in two pregnancies with fetal intracranial abnormality were completed by taking a restricted number of computed tomography (CT) scans under ultrasonic control. General information achieved by CT was not greater compared with ultrasonography. CT demonstrated better than ultrasound the calcified areas in the intracranial teratoma of the fetus. In the case of fetal hydrocephaly the existence of a dilated, but otherwise intact cerebral ventricular system was established by CT after a somewhat controversial ultrasonic finding. CT can be used as a complementary examination when there are specific problems to be evaluated after antenatal ultrasonic scanning. CT should be used in these cases under ultrasonic control and the information of the both methods must be combined for the clinical decisions.
apolipoprotein	apo	The consequences of hepatic lipase treatment of chylomicron remnants were studied. Rats were fed corn oil to induce production and secretion of chylomicrons and were then injected with polyclonal antiserum raised against hepatic lipase to specifically and quantitatively inhibit hepatic lipase activity in vivo. A fraction enriched in chylomicron remnants was isolated from rat plasma by a brief centrifugation step that preferentially isolates triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein (apo) B-48-containing lipoproteins. The chylomicron remnants were then treated with hepatic lipase in vitro, or incubated under identical conditions in the absence of enzyme (control incubations). Hepatic lipase-treated and control chylomicron remnants were isolated by a second brief centrifugation step using discontinuous salt gradients. Control lipoproteins were collected from one discrete band at d < 1.02 g/ml. Hepatic lipase-treated chylomicron remnants formed two discrete bands and were collected at two densities: d < 1.02 g/ml and 1.02 < d < 1.04 g/ml. The buoyant (d < 1.02 g/ml) subfraction of hepatic lipase-treated chylomicron remnants was depleted of 62% of the total phospholipid when compared to control d < 1.02 g/ml lipoproteins. The dense (1.02 < d < 1.04 g/ml) subfraction of hepatic lipase-treated chylomicron remnants was depleted of 65% of particle phospholipid content and 90% of particle triglyceride content when compared to control d < 1.02 g/ml lipoproteins. The dense (1.02 < d < 1.04 g/ml) subfraction of hepatic lipase-treated chylomicron remnants showed 5- to 7-fold greater immunoreactivity of apoE when compared to control lipoproteins in competitive displacement immunoassays. These data suggest that extensive hydrolysis of chylomicron remnant phospholipid and triglyceride leads to the formation of a dense remnant particle that contains highly exposed apoE. This increased exposure of apoE may be the key to the previously observed increased degradation of chylomicron remnants treated with hepatic lipase because more exposed apoE may bind better to cell surface lipoprotein receptors. Furthermore, the data imply that hepatic lipase cleaves chylomicron remnant phospholipid and triglyceride in a sequential fashion; hydrolytic intermediates depleted only of phospholipid precede the formation of a smaller dense remnant particle depleted of phospholipid and triglyceride.
recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor	rhM-CSF	OBJECTIVE: To study the hematopoietic enhancing effects of recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhM-CSF) expressed in silkworm. METHOD: Balb/c mice were irradiated with sublethal dose of 60 Co gamma-rays and then administered intraperitoneally with silkworm expressed rhM-CSF (1000 U per individual for 7 days) in treatment group or with normal saline (for 7 days as well) in control group. The hematopoietic recovery of irradiation mice was observed by comparing peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts, differential counts of WBC and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cell colony forming assay in soft agar at different time after irradiation. RESULTS: The total WBC counts (x 10(9)/L) of treatment group at day 15 and 20 after irradiation(3.42 +/- 1.20, 5.56 +/- 2.50, respectively) were significantly higher than those of control group (2.03 +/- 0.90, 3.72 +/- 2.30; both P < 0.05). On days 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 after irradiation, the monocyte counts (x 10(9)/L) of treatment group (0.08 +/- 0.06, 0.16 +/- 0.10, 0.48 +/- 0.35, 0.47 +/- 0.21 and 0.33 +/- 0.17, respectively) were all significantly higher than those of control group (0.025 +/- 0.016, 0.05 +/- 0.04, 0.23 +/- 0.16, 0.33 +/- 0.19 and 0.17 +/- 0.13; all P < 0.05). On days 15, 20 and 25, the granulocyte count (X 10(9)/L) of treatment group (1.03 +/- 0.61, 2.18 +/- 1.19 and 3.28 +/- 1.09) were also higher than those of control group (0.62 +/- 0.37, 1.40 +/- 0.99 and 2.20 +/- 0.74; all P < 0.05). On day 9 after irradiation, the bone marrow CFU-GM yield of control group (19 +/- 11/10(6) cells) was significantly lower than that of treatment group (78 +/- 30/10(6) cells, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: rhM-CSF expressed in silkworm could accelerate hematopoietic recovery in irradiated mice.

The hematopoietic recovery of irradiation mice was observed by comparing peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts, differential counts of WBC and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cell colony forming assay in soft agar at different time after irradiation. RESULTS: The total WBC counts (x 10(9)/L) of treatment group at day 15 and 20 after irradiation(3.42 +/- 1.20, 5.56 +/- 2.50, respectively) were significantly higher than those of control group (2.03 +/- 0.90, 3.72 +/- 2.30; both P < 0.05). On days 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 after irradiation, the monocyte counts (x 10(9)/L) of treatment group (0.08 +/- 0.06, 0.16 +/- 0.10, 0.48 +/- 0.35, 0.47 +/- 0.21 and 0.33 +/- 0.17, respectively) were all significantly higher than those of control group (0.025 +/- 0.016, 0.05 +/- 0.04, 0.23 +/- 0.16, 0.33 +/- 0.19 and 0.17 +/- 0.13; all P < 0.05). On days 15, 20 and 25, the granulocyte count (X 10(9)/L) of treatment group (1.03 +/- 0.61, 2.18 +/- 1.19 and 3.28 +/- 1.09) were also higher than those of control group (0.62 +/- 0.37, 1.40 +/- 0.99 and 2.20 +/- 0.74; all P < 0.05). On day 9 after irradiation, the bone marrow CFU-GM yield of control group (19 +/- 11/10(6) cells) was significantly lower than that of treatment group (78 +/- 30/10(6) cells, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: rhM-CSF expressed in silkworm could accelerate hematopoietic recovery in irradiated mice.
high density lipoprotein	HDL	Patients with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations, particularly men, should be treated to lessen their chance of subsequent morbidity from coronary heart disease. Reduction of elevated triglyceride levels is more contentious, but is justified in severely affected individuals. The levels requiring treatment can only be judged by consideration of the overall clinical setting, including patient age and sex, the presence of other risk factors and the particular lipoprotein abnormality. In general, relative youth, male sex, a low level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a strong family history of coronary heart disease will favour vigorous therapy. The possibility that hyperlipoproteinaemia is secondary to some other metabolic disorder should be considered, particularly in regard to elevated triglyceride levels.
Cytidine to uridine	C-to-U	Cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) editing occurs in plant mitochondria with very high specificity such that only specific cytidines are converted to uridines. The mechanisms for editing site selection in plant mitochondria are unknown. In order to examine the determinants of editing site recognition, repeated mitochondrial DNA sequences that include edited nucleotides have been evaluated as editing substrates. During evolution the maize mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunit 12 (rps12) gene recombined with intron 1 of the ribosomal protein subunit 3 (rps3) gene and a region of the S1-like sequence of the 2.3 kb plasmid. These recombinations created a second copy of an internal portion of the rps12 gene, known as rps12b, which includes the first four editing sites of rps12 transcripts. The duplicated sequence extends seven nucleotides upstream of editing site 1 and six nucleotides downstream from editing site 4. The sequences of rps12 and rps12b are identical between these sites except for a single change at -5 from editing site 1. These modifications did not effect C-to-U conversion at editing sites 2, 3, or 4 in rps12b; however, no editing was detected at editing site 1 in rps12b cDNAs. Thus, the 5' recombination abolished editing at site I, while the 3' recombination modified the downstream RNA sequence, but did not effect editing at site IV. Secondary structure prediction suggests that changes in editing site recognition do not correlate with differences in secondary structures, and that primary RNA sequence may be responsible for editing site specification.

bovine virus diarrhoea virus	BVDV	The spread of bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in a closed dairy herd maintained under typical management conditions is studied using two approaches. In the first instance a stochastic computer model is used to simulate the month-to-month changes in the infection status of each animal. These results are contrasted with the results of a mass-action model which uses three differential equations. A comparison of the two approaches indicates that the results are in broad agreement. The stochastic approach has the benefit of providing an estimate of the probability of the infection becoming extinct and the herd becoming BVDV-free for different herd sizes.
single nucleotide polymorphisms	SNPs	Optimisation and validation of methods to assess single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in archival histological material.
single nucleotide polymorphisms	SNPs	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing amount of evidence indicates that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may affect a variety of oncology related phenotypes. Occasionally, it is convenient to base studies addressing genotype-phenotype relationships on historical patient cohorts, from which only archival specimens are available. This study was conducted to validate protocols optimised for assessment of SNPs based on paraffin embedded, formalin fixed tissue samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 137 breast cancer patients, three TGFB1 SNPs were assessed based on archival histological specimens. In 37 of these patients, the SNPs were also assessed using cultured fibroblasts and the assays were validated by direct comparison of the results. From the remaining 100 patients, only archival material was available. In these patients, the existence of a genetic linkage pattern between the assessed TGFB1 SNPs was used to provide an indirect validation of the genotyping results. Furthermore, two different methods for DNA extraction were compared (semi-automatic DNA extraction using the ABI Prism 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation versus Proteinase K digestion for 5 days followed by boiling and DNA precipitation). RESULTS: Assessment of SNPs based on archival histological material is encumbered by a number of obstacles and pitfalls. However, these can be widely overcome by careful optimisation of the methods used for sample selection, DNA extraction and PCR. Within 130 samples that fulfil the criteria for analysis a highly reliable SNP assessment was observed. The study demonstrated that different 'down-stream applications' ('single nucleotide primer extension' or 'TaqMan-based' real-time PCR) could be used as genotyping procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable assessment of SNPs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens is possible but a number of precautions should be carefully taken.
liver infusion tryptose	LIT	Animal reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi infection were investigated in 5 communities in the Department of San Pedro, currently one of Paraguay's most highly endemic areas. A total of 112 domestic animals (37 cattle, 2 horses, 1 ass, 20 pigs, 44 dogs and 8 cats) and 4 wild animals (1 white-eared opossum, 2 yellow armadillos and 1 common long-nosed armadillo) were examined for blood. Although no trypomastigotes were found by 2 direct observation methods, the microhaematocrit and Giemsa stained thick and thin smears methods, several forms of trypanosoma flagellates morphologically identical to T. cruzi were detected in the liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium from a single sample taken from a yellow armadillo, Euphractus sexicintus. When serum samples of all the animals were examined for antibody to T. cruzi by direct agglutination (DA) test, 3 cattle, 2 pigs, 16 dogs and 3 cats had positive titers (1:32 or greater), but no wild animals showed positive reactions. T. cruzi was not found by culture nor microscopic examination of samples from any of the seropositive animals. However, domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, dogs and cats which were found to be seropositive in this study, possibly act as an animal reservoir in this endemic area as well as armadillos in which T. cruzi was observed.

2,4-dinitrophenyl	DNP	Murine hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies against the 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) group were generated by fusion of NS1 mouse myeloma cells and mouse spleen cells. The spleen cells were obtained from recipient mice which had received spleen cells from syngeneic mice immunized with DNP-ovalbumin and which were subsequently infected with N.b. larvae simultaneously with the adoptive cell transfer. The recipient mice were immunized with DNP-N.b.-protein. Four fusion experiments were performed starting with spleen cells from recipient mice at days 5, 11, 20 and 44 after the adoptive cell transfer. Sixty-one hybrids out of 550 secreted immunoglobulins of an unknown specific including 4 IgE- and 7 IgM-secreting hybrids; 2 produced immunoglobulins of an unknown isotype. IgE clones were obtained only when the spleens were taken 1-2 weeks after the adoptive cell transfer, while only IgM-producing cells were generated with spleen cells 6 weeks after the adoptive cell transfer although the IgE-serum titers did not decline within this time period. The analysis of the light chains for the DNP-specific antibodies revealed seven with kappa- and three lambda-light chains.
Jumping translocation breakpoint	JTB	Characterization of Jumping translocation breakpoint (JTB) gene product isolated as a TGF-beta1-inducible clone involved in regulation of mitochondrial function, cell growth and cell death.
Jumping translocation breakpoint	JTB	Jumping translocation breakpoint (JTB) is a gene located on human chromosome 1 at q21 that suffers an unbalanced translocation in various types of cancers, and potentially encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. The results of cancer profiling indicated that its expression was suppressed in many cancers from different organs, implying a role in the neoplastic transformation of cells. Recently, we isolated JTB as a TGF-beta1-inducible clone by differential screening. In this study, we characterized its product and biological functions. We found that it was processed at the N-terminus and located mostly in mitochondria. When expressed in cells, JTB-induced clustering of mitochondria around the nuclear periphery and swelling of each mitochondrion. In those mitochondria, membrane potential, as monitored with a JC-1 probe, was significantly reduced. Coinciding with these changes in mitochondria, JTB retarded the growth of the cells and conferred resistance to TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. These activities were dependent on the N-terminal processing and induced by wild-type JTB but not by a mutant resistant to cleavage. These findings raised the possibility that aberration of JTB in structure or expression induced neoplastic changes in cells through dysfunction of mitochondria leading to deregulated cell growth and/or death.
AIDS dementia complex	ADC	AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is the most common presenting neurologic manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. We report FDG-PET studies in a 39-year-old man who had ADC and completed a 12-wk treatment protocol with 1.2 mg/day of intranasal peptide T, one before and one after 12 wk of treatment with peptide T. Peptide T is an octapeptide under investigation for treatment of ADC patients. Values of rCMRglc were converted to Z scores using the mean and standard deviation of values of rCMRglc in three HIV-seronegative matched controls, each of which was studied twice, at the beginning and end of a 12-wk interval. Thirty-five of 60 regions assayed showed Z scores with absolute values > or = 3 (considered abnormal) in the baseline study. Regions with high absolute values of Z scores were located in subcortical areas and in the limbic system, and to a lesser degree in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Thirty-four of these 35 regions showed remission (decrease in the absolute values of Z scores) after treatment. Only one region showed no improvement in the second study. Three regions with absolute values of Z scores < 3 in the baseline study manifested Z scores with magnitudes > or = 3 in the second study. These preliminary observations suggest that functional neuroimaging techniques provide a useful tool in the evaluation of the response to treatment in ADC patients.

Big White Polish Breed	BWPB	The reported investigations were carried out on old breeding sows belonging to the Big White Polish Breed (BWPB) which were compared with a control group of young female pigs before fertilization, belonging to the same breed. In the perinatal period the animals were examined for presence of chronic ischaemic heart disease by clinical methods and ECG. In the interoestrus period determinations were performed in the serum of total cholesterol, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total lipids and lipoprotein fractions. After killing the animals the heart and the coronary arteries were examined macroscopically and microscopically. Clinical examinations demonstrated coronary failure confirmed by ECG investigations. A correlation was found between hyperlipidaemia, particularly dyslipoproteinaemia, and advanced arteriomediosclerosis of the intramural vessels of the left ventricle, with selective, evident atherosclerotic changes in the left main coronary artery. Correlations and clinico-pathological interrelations are discussed between coronary failure, hyperlipidaemia and morphological changes in the left part of the heart.
standard-length outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program	CRP	Participation in a standard-length outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP) for 3 months is known to result in positive changes in body composition, functional capacity, and blood lipids in patients with coronary artery disease. However, there has been little attempt to compare patients who remain active in a formal CRP for an extended length of >1 year with patients who exit after a standard length of 3 months. Consequently, 50 patients underwent a series of tests including a maximal graded exercise treadmill test, assessment of body composition, and fasting blood lipid analysis, at entry to CRP and after a follow-up period that ranged from 1 to 5 years. All patients participated in a standard multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program for 3 months. Twenty-five patients discontinued participation after 3 months and received no other contact from the program staff until follow-up, whereas 25 patients remained active in the program until follow-up. After statistically adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, significant differences were observed between the extended- and standard-length groups at follow-up for body weight (177 vs 183 lbs), percent fat (22% vs 24%), METS (10.5 vs 8.4), high-density lipoprotein level cholesterol (44 vs 39 mg/dl), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio (5.2 vs 6.1), and triglycerides (134 vs 204 mg/dl), respectively. No significant differences in the adjusted means were observed between the groups at follow-up for total cholesterol (209 vs 219 mg/dl) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (136 vs 138 mg/dl). Data from this study demonstrate the efficacy of extended participation in CRP on body composition, functional capacity, and blood lipids. Greater efforts need to be directed at retaining patients in low-cost, center-based maintenance programs and at extending monitoring of patients exiting standard length CRPs.
enhanced computed tomographic	CT	A 65-year old man presented with a seven-month history of macrohematuria and left back pain. Abdominal ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), selective renal angiography and vena cavography revealed a left renal tumor extending into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. Surgery was performed using the cardiopulmonary bypass and the whole tumor was resected grossly except for the tumor invading into the lumbar vein. The patient recovered promptly but died from cancer metastasis six months after operation.

hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase	HGPRT	Partial hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) deficiency, also known as the Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome, can give rise to a wide range of neurological symptoms, and renal insufficiency. Biochemically, it is characterized by high uric acid concentrations in blood, high uric acid and hypoxanthine excretion in urine, and decreased activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase activity (HGPRT). However, normal uric acid concentrations in blood and uric acid excretions in urine have been reported. Here, a boy is presented with normal development and suffering from recurrent attacks of acute renal failure with slightly to clearly increased urinary uric acid excretion. Between these attacks, episodes of elevated urinary excretion of uric acid were observed with normal blood concentrations of uric acid and normal urinary excretion of hypoxanthine. HGPRT activity in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibroblasts was found to be strongly decreased. This case shows that not only normal blood uric acid but also normal urinary hypoxanthine concentrations do not exclude the diagnosis of partial HGPRT deficiency.

gas chromatography-mass spectrometry	GC-MS	Urinary concentrations of the beta-antagonist oxprenolol and some of its major human metabolites were determined following oral administration of a dose of 160 mg to five fasted horses. Quantitation was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the selected ion mode (SIM) by monitoring ion m/z 466 of the heptafluorobutyric derivatives. As early as 2 h after dosage oxprenolol could be detected in hydrolysed urine and remained detectable up to 24 h. Maximum urinary concentrations and excretion rates were obtained between 2 and 12 h. After 12 h only 2.8% of the administered dose was excreted as conjugates of oxprenolol and major human metabolites including 4-OH-oxprenolol and 5-OH-oxprenolol. These metabolites were detectable up to 48 h.

bovine immunoglobulin G	IgG	Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit feeding of protein derived from mammalian tissue, excluding blood and blood products and any product that consists entirely of porcine or equine protein. A novel lateral flow immunoassay device has been developed that can quickly and qualitatively determine the presence of bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG), a major component in blood products, at very low levels (0.01% v/v). The device can be used to test for bovine IgG commingling in spray-dried porcine plasma used in the feed industry. Producers and consumers alike could use this device to verify product content at threshold levels.
polysialic acid	PSA	We have previously proposed that polysialic acid (PSA), which is attached to NCAM on the cell surface, can serve to regulate a variety of cell-cell interactions. The present study provides evidence that hydrated PSA influences a sufficiently large volume at the cell surface to exert broad steric effects, and that the removal of PSA in fact causes a detectable change in intercellular space. Using F11 neuron/neuroblastoma hybrid cells as a model system, the measured density and size of PSA suggests that a substantial fraction of the space between two apposed cell surface membranes could be sterically influenced by the presence of PSA. Specific enzymatic removal of PSA, which is similar in magnitude to changes that occur in many tissues during normal development, caused about a 25% decrease in the distance between two apposed cells. By contrast, removal of both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate from the cells had no effect on this parameter. It is proposed that such changes in membrane-membrane distance could serve to alter selectively the efficiency of encounter between complementary receptors on apposing cells, and explain at least in part the broad biological influences of PSA.
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin	beta-HCG	Persistent elevations in serum markers after chemotherapy for germ cell testicular carcinoma indicate residual disease. We report on a patient with advanced seminoma with choriocarcinoma who had elevated serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) and residual masses on computerized tomography scan after chemotherapy. Wedge liver resection and retroperitoneal node dissection yielded only necrotic tissue which assayed and immunoperoxidase stained positively for beta-HCG. Serum beta-HCG fell to undetectable levels postoperatively, and the patient remains disease-free after three years. Phagocytosis of necrotic tumor apparently released entrapped beta-HCG resulting in a false positive tumor marker.
saquinavir	SQV	During a randomized double-blind study to assess the antiviral activity of saquinavir (SQV) alone or in combination with zidovudine (ZDV), the emergence of phenotypic resistance was evaluated in 44 patients treated with SQV (13 subjects), ZDV (14 subjects), and SQV plus ZDV (17 subjects). A significant (P< 0.05) lower CD4+ cell count and higher HIV RNA copy number at entry were found in six patients who developed resistant viral strain (3 to ZDV and 3 to SQV) during the first 4 months of treatment. After 1 year, drug-resistant strains (12 to ZDV and 14 to SQV) were isolated in 26 out of 37 patients. A significant higher number of patients treated with ZDV alone (10/13) harbored ZDV-resistant strains compared to patients treated by combination therapy (2/13); whereas more than 50% of patients had SQV-resistant strains aside from treatment. Early SQV-resistant strains were isolated in a limited number of patients treated with SQV alone (3/13). The rates of emergence of resistant strains during ZDV or SQV monotherapies are comparable. Combination therapy may delay the emergence of phenotypic resistance to either drugs in the short term and to ZDV, but not to SQV, at least after 1 year.

Ester gum	EG	Ester gum (EG) is used in citrus oil-based beverage flavourings as a weighting or colouring agent. In the present study, concentrations of 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg body weight were administered orally to male Swiss albino mice, and sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberration were used as the cytogenetic endpoints to determine the genotoxic and clastogenic potential of the food additive. Although EG was weakly clastogenic and could induce a marginal increase in sister chromatid exchange frequencies, it was not a potential health hazard at the doses tested.
All-trans retinoic acid	RA	All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity by 3-8-fold in murine F9 teratocarcinoma cells, in parallel with their differentiation towards primitive endoderm. The elevation of ALP activity is associated with increases in the amounts of liver/bone/kidney-type ALP protein and the respective transcript. These effects of RA are due to activation of ALP gene transcription rather than to an increase in the half-life of the mRNA. Induction of ALP mRNA does not require de novo protein synthesis, since it is not blocked by treatment with cycloheximide. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which is known to induce further differentiation of F9 cells from the primitive to the parietal endoderm, blocks the induction of ALP mRNA by RA.

Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which is known to induce further differentiation of F9 cells from the primitive to the parietal endoderm, blocks the induction of ALP mRNA by RA.
low ambient temperature	T(a)	Uricotely (uric acid >50% of urinary nitrogen) in birds was once considered ubiquitous. However, Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna) have been shown to be an exception to this rule; under conditions of low ambient temperature (T(a)) and on a nitrogen-free diet, they increased their water intake and often became ammonotelic (ammonia >50% of urinary nitrogen). Our aim was to identify the effects of nitrogen intake, water intake, and T(a) on the ammonia excretion of yellow-vented bulbuls (Pycnonotus xanthopygos). We chose this predominantly frugivorous species because many of the characteristics of nectarivores that were used to explain increased ammonia excretion by C. anna are also characteristics of frugivorous birds. We assayed ureteral urine composition in eight yellow-vented bulbuls (P. xanthopygos), each randomly allocated a diet of 20% (0.6 M) sucrose solution supplemented by either 1.03 g/L or 7.23 g/L soy protein and held at a T(a) of either 28 degrees C or 10 degrees C. Food, and therefore water, intake rates varied with nitrogen intake but not with T(a). Food intake increased significantly with decreased nitrogen intake, while concentrations of all the excretory compounds in the urine (P<0.05) decreased; yet their proportions in the urine did not change significantly. The lower T(a) had no significant effect on food intake or on the concentration of uric acid. However, at 10 degrees C, the ammonia and urea concentrations increased (P<0.05), and this led to a significant increase in the proportion of ammonia in the urine. Our results demonstrate that, when bulbuls are exposed to low T(a), they are able to save energy by increasing the proportion of the ammonia in their urine.
Coefficient of variation	CV	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of the intensity of Schistosoma japonicum infection with the variation in individual egg counts. METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from residents in a village in Jiangxi Province and examined with Kato-Katz thick smear method for seven consecutive days. Two smears were prepared and microscopically examined for each specimen. 570 individuals completed the investigation. Coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess the intra-individual variation of the egg counts, in relation to the demographic characteristics including age, sex, occupation, and the intensity of infection. RESULTS: The proportion of individuals with at least one positive finding increased from 33.0% in a single measurement to 56.5% by seven measurements (P<0.01). The average intensity of infection in a single Kato-Katz test (111.06 EPG) was markedly higher than the average accumulated intensity of infection (42.51 EPG). Variation of intra-individual: the variation of CV in female infected subjects was higher than males (P<0.05). The variation of CV in 0-9 age group was higher than other age groups (P<0.05). The lowest variation of CV was detected in fishermen (P<0.05), but no statistical difference was found among other occupation groups. With an increase of the intensity of infection, the variation of CV decreased gradually. A negative correlation was observed between the variation of CV and the intensity of infection(r=-0.717, P<0.01). There was no significant difference in variation of CV between males and females, age and occupation groups when data were stratified according to the intensity of infection (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum infection by single Kato-Katz test was obviously lower than the real figures. The intensity of infection may be an essential factor that affects the intra-individual variation of egg counts.
firing rate-injected current	f-i	1. The basic question of how motoneurons transform synaptic inputs into spike train outputs remains unresolved, despite detailed knowledge of their morphology, electrophysiology, and synaptic connectivity. We have approached this problem by making measurements of a synaptic input under steady-state conditions and combining them with quantitative assessments of their effects on the discharge rates of cat spinal motoneurons. 2. We used a modified voltage-clamp technique to measure the steady-state effective synaptic currents (IN) produced by rubrospinal input to cat triceps surae motoneurons. In the same motoneurons we measured the slope of the firing rate-injected current (f-i) relation in the primary range. We then reactivated the rubrospinal input during steady, repetitive firing to assess its effect on motoneuron discharge rate. 3. We found that changes in the steady-state discharge rate of a motoneuron produced by this synaptic input could be described simply as the product of the net effective synaptic current measured at the soma and the slope of the motoneuron's f-i relation. This expression essentially redefines synaptic efficacy in terms of a cell's basic input-output function. Further, measurements of effective synaptic current simplify the task of estimating synaptic efficacy, because detailed knowledge of neither the electrotonic architecture of the postsynaptic cell nor of the locations of the presynaptic boutons is required.
Polarization-sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography	PS-OCT	The remineralization of enamel caries can lead to distinct optical changes within a lesion. We hypothesized that the restoration of mineral volume would result in a measurable decrease in the depth-resolved reflectivity of polarized light from the lesion. To test this hypothesis, we measured optical changes in artificial caries undergoing remineralization as a function of depth, using Polarization-sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT). Lesions were imaged non-destructively before and after exposure to a remineralization regimen. After imaging, microradiographs of histological thin sections indicated that the significant reflectivity reduction measured by PS-OCT accurately represented the increase in mineral content within a larger repaired surface zone. Mineral volume changes arising from remineralization can be measured on the basis of the optical reflectivity of the lesion.
cytomegalovirus	CMV	Preliminary data suggest a faster immune recovery following non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation because of the persistence of recipient T cells, but the real impact on post-transplant infectious complications remains unknown. We retrospectively analysed the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in twenty patients following reduced intensity conditioning with busulfan/fludarabine+/-thiotepa and post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine A/mycophenolate mofetil. Results were compared with 20 patients receiving myeloablative transplants during the same time period and who were matched for CMV risk group and for donor origin. The cumulative incidence of CMV infection following reduced intensity vs. myeloablative transplants was 60.4% vs. 40.0%, respectively (p value 0.1, log rank test). The risk for CMV infection in both cohorts was increased after in vivo T cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (75% and 60%, respectively). Acute GVHD preceded the diagnosis of CMV infection by a median of 25 (range, 9-61) days following reduced intensity transplants and a median of 14 (range, 10-34) days in myeloablative transplants. Recurrent CMV infections were observed only in patients receiving reduced intensity transplants. Using multivariate analysis only reduced intensity transplantation and in vivo T cell depletion had a significant impact on the risk of CMV infection. In our series the incidence for CMV infection following reduced intensity transplants seems to be increased as compared with risk-matched myeloablative transplants. When adding anti-T cell antibodies to the conditioning regimen, the risk for CMV infection increases by up to 75%. Thorough studies of the risk of post-transplant viral infection are necessary to optimize surveillance as well as pre-emptive and/or prophylactic treatment strategies in the non-myeloablative transplantation setting.
inertia or depression),	apathy	Subcortical dementia, a concept introduced 20 years ago, is a clinical entity characterized by memory disorders, an impaired ability to manipulate acquired knowledge, important changes of personality (apathy, inertia or depression), slowed thought processes (or bradyphrenia). It is also marked by overwhelming signs of frontal dysfunction. Cognitive and behavioural disturbances are frequently combined to movement disorders (tremor, chorea, dystonia etc). Anatomical, clinical and scintigraphic data suggest that the frontal signs result from a disconnection of the frontal cortex from the basal ganglia. Therefore it is probably more accurate to use the term subcortico-frontal dementia. This pattern of dementia, clearly different from a cortical dementia as dementia of Alzheimer's disease, may be described in a wide range of diseases which mainly involve the subcortical areas: some cases of Parkinson's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, the etat lacunaire, multiple sclerosis and so on. The concept of subcortical dementia has allowed a better understanding of the role of the basal ganglia and their cortical connections in cognition and behavior. Its neurochemical substrate remains poorly characterized, although the ascending dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways seem to be good candidates, at least in Parkinson's disease.
1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol	OAG	The degranulation reactions of human neutrophils induced by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and calcium ionophore A23187 or their combinations, were studied. OAG in the absence of the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 stimulated the releases of both lysozyme and lactoferrin, constituents of the specific granules, but did not stimulate the release of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme of the azurophil granules. Electron microscopy revealed a selective decrease in the numbers of the specific granules in this case. The combined effects of A23187 at a concentration higher than 0.1 microM and OAG were essentially additive. W-7, known to be an inhibitor of both Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C-kinase) and calmodulin, inhibited the degranulation induced by OAG or PMA, while it inhibited the reaction induced by A23187 less markedly. The release of lysozyme reached a plateau at about 0.1 microM A23187 and increased again at higher concentrations of A23187. The observations suggest that degranulation can be induced by the activation of the C-kinase, and the degranulation by A23187 at low concentrations may be due to the activation of the C-kinase; the effects of A23187 at high concentrations, however, could not be explained only in terms of the activation of the C-kinase.

aminoglycosidic antibiotic	AA	The first detectable effect on the auditory system after a single high-dose injection of an aminoglycosidic antibiotic (AA) like gentamicin (GM) is the reversible blockade of medial efferent function, probably via blockade of calcium channels at the base of the outer hair cells (OHC). The kinetics of this effect are compatible with that of the molecule in perilymph. In the course of chronic treatment with lower doses, however, ototoxicity develops only after several days of treatment. Still GM can be observed inside the OHCs as soon as 24 hours after the first injection, and will be still present in some OHCs as long as 11 months after a chronic, nonototoxic 6-day treatment. In vitro, the short-term viability of isolated OHCs is not affected by exposure to AAs, but their transduction channels and their response to acetylcholine are reversibly blocked. However, developing organs of Corti in culture are highly and rapidly affected by exposure to AAs. Yet during direct intracochlear perilymphatic perfusion of GM, 2-mM solutions are not ototoxic, and with perfusion with a 20-mM solution ototoxicity develops only after several days of perfusion. From these various observations one can describe some aspects of the mechanisms of ototoxicity of AAs, from their access to perilymph and endolymph, to penetration in the hair cells, likely via endocytosis at their apical pole, and intracellular cytotoxic events.

Food and Drug Administration	FDA	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Gilead Sciences' intravenous drug, cidofovir, for people with CMV retinitis. The FDA also granted final marketing approval for ganciclovir eye implants sold by Chiron Vision. Chiron and Hoffmann-La Roche are co-marketing the device. The device costs $4,000, plus the cost of surgically fastening the device to the eye, which can be as much as $6,000. The device needs to be replaced every six months. The FDA advisory panel also recommended approving cidofovir as systemic treatment for new or relapsing CMV retinitis in people with AIDS. The drug is currently available free in an expanded access program or as a follow-up to trials. Participants must have experienced CMV relapse on either ganciclovir or foscarnet. Many fear that levels of the drug reaching the eye from oral doses are suboptimal and may induce drug resistance, although observations suggest that resistance is a rare occurrence.
Nuclear magnetic resonance	NMR	Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of extracts have proven to be a powerful window onto the intracellular machinery of cells and tissues. The major advantages of in vitro 1H-NMR, namely chemical preservation, simultaneous detection, identification, and quantitation of compounds, and sensitivity to a large variety of classes of compounds, are employed in this study to characterize the metabolic course of mitogen-stimulated proliferation of human peripheral lymphocytes. A reliable method to quantitate amino acids, metabolic intermediates, soluble membrane lipid precursors, and purine, pyridine and pyrimidine nucleotides is presented, using samples as small as 30 mg wet weight. A total of 53 substances were detected in lymphocytes and other blood cells. During the course of lymphocyte culture, changes in intracellular concentrations of lactate, taurine, inositol and nucleotides, including NAD, IMP and high-energy phosphates, were especially marked. 1H-NMR compares favorably to 31P-NMR and to HPLC, and is especially attractive in light of expectations for future in vivo application.
bone mineral density	BMD	BACKGROUND: The effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism on bone mineral density (BMD) induced by suppressive thyroxine therapy in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) remains unclear. An overview of the current literature was undertaken to evaluate studies to date. METHODS: A systematic medline search yielded a total of 11 studies appropriate for review which included premenopausal women, postmenopausal women, and men on suppressive thyroxine post thyroidectomy for WDTC. Main outcome measures were bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. CONCLUSIONS: Although studies were limited by small numbers and varying degrees of control for confounding variables, results suggested no significant change in bone mineral density for premenopausal women or men. Findings for postmenopausal women remain unclear with two of the best controlled studies reporting opposing results. Further studies for this population are recommended to help guide clinical practice.

Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma	OCCA	Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (OCCA) is known to be less responsive to cisplatin and most other anti-cancer drugs and to have a poorer prognosis than other ovarian cancers. We report a rare case of stage IIIc OCCA in a patient who has been treated postoperatively with cisplatin alone and continues to survive after 7.5 years. In this case, 25 mg/m2/day of cisplatin was administered for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. After remission, intermittent administration of cisplatin every 3 to 4 months was performed 8 times. This case suggests that induction and intermittent chemotherapy using consecutive low-dose cisplatin administration may be a useful treatment for OCCA.
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia	T-ALL	Morphological, cytochemical, immunological and clinical features of 19 adult patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were investigated at the time of diagnosis and were compared with those of 34 adult patients affected by B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Immunophenotypic studies employing a wide panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) revealed a heterogeneous pattern of antigen expression in the five T-ALL groups that were identified on the basis of blast T cell differentiation levels. PAS (periodic acid Schiff) negativity and focal AP (acid phosphatase) positivity, as well as white blood cell count and serum lactic dehydrogenase levels, were significantly related to T-ALL when compared with B-ALL. On the contrary, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the clinical outcome.

multidrug resistant	MDR	Various agents have been shown to enhance drug sensitivity of multidrug resistant (MDR) cells and are thus of interest when the MDR phenotype is identified. Detection of MDR cells is of importance and can be carried out either by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies or by functional tests using fluorescent dyes uptake. MDR has been analysed by flow cytometry on three sensitive and resistant cell lines, with MRK16 and C219 monoclonal antibodies directed against P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and with rhodamine 123, Hoechst 33342 and daunorubicin. Resistant cells were revealed by MRK16 and C219 but the results obtained with MRK16 gave higher both percentages of fluorescent cells and mean fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity observed with daunorubicin was lower than with rhodamine 123. With Hoechst 33342, mean fluorescence was quite identical on sensitive and on resistant cells. It was concluded that MRK16 and rhodamine 123 were well adapted to detect P-gp and evaluate its functional ability.

Endothelin	ET	Endothelin (ET) produced by endothelial cells has recently been found to be a potent vasoconstricting hormone. In this report, ET is shown to be a potent stimulator of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by rat bone marrow (BM)-derived stromal cells. It was also shown that ET increased the level of mRNA for IL-6 in these cells. The two types of ET receptor (R), ETAR and ETBR, were shown to be expressed on both BM-derived stromal cells in culture and ex vivo in BM tissue, suggesting that ET works as a physiologic stimulator of IL-6 production in the BM. It was shown that ETAR is coupled to phospholipase C activation, leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) as second messengers in BM-derived stromal cells. This was corroborated by data showing that IL-6 production in these cells was induced by combined stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate, thereby bypassing the effects of IP3 and DAG, respectively. This is the first report on the hormonal regulation of IL-6 production by BM stromal cells, indicating that hematopoiesis is subject to endocrinologic regulation under physiologic conditions. ET has recently been reported to be produced by macrophages in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and human immunodeficiency virus-1 glycoprotein 120. These facts, taken together with our findings, raise the possibility that ET shares the same role of IL-1 as a local cytokine, mediating an intercellular signal between macrophages and BM stromal cells in response to bacterial or viral stimulation.

otitis media with effusion	OME	Hydrolytic activity of various lysosomal proteases--elastase, collagenase, and cathepsins B and H--were measured in 125 middle ear effusions from patients with chronic (serous and mucoid) and acute otitis media with effusion (OME). The levels of cathepsin B activity and alpha-2-macroglobulin during the course of clinical therapies (myringotomy and tympanostomy tubing) were analyzed in 10 chronic OME cases where follow-up evaluation was possible. It is found that the level of lysosomal protease activity (elastase, collagenase and cathepsin B) was higher in acute OME than that in chronic OME; the hydrolytic activity of cathepsin B in middle ear effusions could be used as an indicator to reflect the level of lysosomal proteases activity in the middle ear; in chronic OME, inflammatory reaction including lysosomal protease activity of the middle ear mucosa at the time of the first myringotomy appeared to be more active than that at the time of the final myringotomy, but less than that in acute OME; and the proteolytic damage of lysosomal thiol proteases to the middle ear mucosa, which may be related to the chronicity of OME, could be reduced by both therapeutic myringotomy and tympanostomy.
fine needle aspiration biopsies	FNABs	Immunocytopathologic studies were performed on 79 fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) and effusions from 13 melanomas and 57 other human neoplasms with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) D6.1 raised against a partially purified melanoma-tumor-associated antigen (MTAA). The purposes of these studies were (1) to evaluate the ability of MAb 6.1 to react with melanoma cells in cytopathologic preparations and (2) to define the spectrum of reactivity of MAb D6.1 in cytopathologic preparations of non-melanomas. Cytocentrifuge preparations of the cytopathologic specimens were permitted to react with the primary antibody and were then stained by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method. Thirteen of 13 FNABs of malignant melanomas exhibited staining reactivity with MAb D6.1. Among the nonmelanoma tumors tested, staining reactivity was observed in 30 of 57 specimens. Among specific neoplasms, staining was present in 5 of 11 adenocarcinomas of the breast, 2 of 7 ovarian adenocarcinomas and 5 of 6 metastatic adenocarcinomas from the colon. Among 17 lung cancers examined, staining was noted in 4 of 7 adenocarcinomas, 3 of 4 large-cell undifferentiated carcinomas and 2 of 3 poorly differentiated squamous-cell carcinomas. Two small-cell undifferentiated carcinomas and one carcinoid failed to stain. Three of three adenocarcinomas of the pancreas showed staining. Among the remaining neoplasms examined, one specimen each of carcinoma of the prostate and the cervix and one carcinoma of undetermined primary exhibited staining. Two malignant lymphomas did not stain. Staining of mesothelial cells was observed in three of nine benign effusions. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

noradrenaline	NA	The role of the endothelium and vascular tone was studied on histamine-induced relaxation and contraction of the rabbit coeliac artery. Histamine contracted the tissue via the release of noradrenaline (NA), an action blocked by prazosin and mepyramine but not influenced by endothelial removal. Tachyphylaxis readily developed to histamine-induced contractions. After a moderate tone (40-55%) was induced with NA, histamine relaxed the tissues concentration-dependently. This relaxation was absent when the endothelium was removed indicating that the receptors involved are located on the endothelium. When the tone was increased to 80-85% with NA, relaxation could only be demonstrated after blocking H1-receptors. Removal of the endothelium did not influence this response. The relaxant effect of histamine in both preparations, however, was blocked by metiamide indicating that it is H2-receptor mediated. In the rabbit coeliac artery, endothelial H2-receptors are readily activated at moderate tone while muscular H2-receptors are stimulated at high tone after blocking H1-receptors. The predominance of H2-receptors in this artery may serve the physiological function of vasodilation in the blood vessels of the stomach.
spontaneously hypertensive rats	SHRs	1. We investigated the renal protective effect of efonidipine hydrochloride (efonidipine, NZ-105) in STZ-induced spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, 8 weeks of age). Diabetic SHRs were treated with 15 mg/kg/day of efonidipine for 12 weeks. 2. The dosage of efonidipine was chosen after preliminary studies demonstrated that it showed mild antihypertensive action (within 20% decrease of systemic blood pressure). 3. In the diabetic SHRs, the excretion of urinary albumin was increased (1.78 +/- 0.09 mg/day) at 4 weeks and reached 4.41 +/- 0.12 mg/day at 12 weeks. The levels of urinary albumin in the diabetic SHRs after treatment with efonidipine were significantly less than those in the diabetic SHRs at 8 and 12 weeks (P < 0.01). 4. Levels of creatinine clearance were decreased in the diabetic SHRs after treatment with efonidipine. 5. In light microscopy, the ratio of glomerular tuft to Bowman's areas was significantly decreased compared with those in the diabetic SHRs (P < 0.05). 6. These findings suggest that efonidipine inhibits the development of albuminuria and glomerular enlargement in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic SHRs and may become a useful antihypertensive drug with a renal protective effect.
single nephron glomerular filtration rate	SNGFR	Glomerular circulatory dynamics were assessed in 60 adult anesthetized rats, which were either deprived or not deprived of water for 24-48 h. Water-deprived rats (n = 21) were characterized by a depressed level of single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) when compared with nonwater-deprived controls (n = 8) (23.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 44.8 +/- 4.1 nl/min). This was primarily due to decreased glomerular plasma flow rate (71 +/- 5 vs. 169 +/- 23 nl/min) and glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (0.028 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.087 +/- 0.011 nl/[s . mmHg]). Infusion of saralasin to these water-deprived rats resulted in significant increases in plasma flow rate and ultrafiltration coefficient, and decline in arteriolar resistances. Consequently, SNGFR increased by approximately 50% from pre-saralasin levels. When water-deprived saralasin-treated rats were given a specific antagonist to the vascular action of arginine vasopressin (AVP), d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a fall in systemic blood pressure occurred, on average from 102 +/- 5 to 80 +/- 5 mmHg, unaccompanied by dilation of renal arterioles, so that both plasma flow rate (129 +/- 8 vs. 85 +/- 13 nl/min) and SNGFR (31.0 +/- 2.9 vs. 18.2 +/- 4.4 nl/min) decreased. This more selective extrarenal constrictor action of AVP was further documented in additional studies in which cardiac output and whole kidney blood flow rate were simultaneously measured. In water-diuretic rats, administration of a moderately pressor dose of AVP (4 mU/kg per min) resulted in a significant rise in kidney blood flow rate (from 8.8 +/- 1.2 to 9.6 +/- 1.3 ml/min). The higher kidney blood flow rate occurred despite a fall in cardiac output (from 111 +/- 7 to 98 +/- 9 ml/min), and was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of systemic vascular to renal vascular resistance (on average from 0.083 +/- 0.014 to 0.106 +/- 0.019). Furthermore, infusion of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP to water-deprived animals (n = 6) to antagonize endogenous AVP resulted in systemic but not renal vasodilation, so that kidney blood flow rate fell (by approximately 30%), as did systemic-to-renal resistance ratio (by approximately 30%). When the above two experiments were repeated in indomethacin-treated animals, exogenous AVP administration in water-diuretic rats (n = 6) and antagonism of endogenous AVP in water-deprived rats (n = 7) caused, respectively, parallel constriction and dilation in systemic and renal vasculatures. The net effect was unaltered systemic to renal vascular resistance ratio in both cases. These results indicate that (1) unlike angiotensin II, AVP maintains glomerular perfusion and filtration in acute extracellular fluid volume depletion by a more selective constriction of the extrarenal vasculature. (2) The relative renal insensitivity to the vasoconstrictor action of AVP appears to be due to an AVP-induced release of a potent renal vasodilator, sensitive to indomethacin, presumably prostaglandins.

phenobarbital	PB	The anticonvulsant phenobarbital (PB), at concentrations of 20, 40, and 90 micrograms/ml, was chronically applied to cell cultures of mouse spinal cord from day 2 or day 14 after initial plating, and the effects of this exposure on neuronal density and morphological characteristics were determined. Neuronal morphological characteristics were analyzed quantitatively following intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow. Cultures exposed to PB for 6 weeks, from day 14 after plating, showed concentration-dependent reductions in neuronal density; both large and small neurons were equally affected. PB exposure also reduced dendritic branching frequency, and the length of dendrites, of remaining large neurons. A higher percentage of these neurons had a bipolar branching pattern than was normally the case. Neurons in cultures exposed to PB from day 2 after plating, compared with those exposed from day 14, showed significantly less alteration in terms of density and morphological characteristics. Effects on neuronal morphological characteristics increased with duration of drug exposure. Equimolar concentrations of barbituric acid produced effects similar to those produced by PB. Chronic exposure to PB adversely affects survival and morphological characteristics of mammalian central neurons grown in cell culture. Curiously, exposure from the time of initial plating appears to be less deleterious than exposure initiated 2 weeks later. To the extent that neuronal development in vitro can be compared to the situation in vivo, these results, and those of other investigators, raise concerns about long-term exposure of the developing human nervous system to PB.
supersonic transport	SST	During the 1950s, military aircraft in France and the United Kingdom developed along almost identical lines in that supersonic fighters were developed together with delta-plan research aircraft capable of speeds twice the speed of sound (Mach 2). At the end of the decade, discussions between the British Aircraft Corp. (BAC) and Sub-Aviation of France (SUD) resulted in suggested designs for a supersonic transport (SST) aircraft. With official backing from both governments, the Anglo-French Concorde Agreement was signed in 1962. At first, the development costs were estimated to be between 150 and 170 million, the costs to be equally divided between both nations. The total costs for research and development are now expected to exceed 1065 million!
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors	SSRIs	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to inhibit serotonin uptake into platelets, resulting in decreased platelet function. We report a case of a large intraventricular haemorrhage in a 6-h-old boy, whose mother used paroxetine during pregnancy.
cholesteryl ester	CE	Human macrophages play a key role in atherogenesis and are believed to be the progenitors of the cholesteryl ester (CE)-laden foam cells present in early atherosclerotic lesions. Several mechanisms by which macrophages accumulate CE have been recently described. One involves a perturbation in LDL metabolism subsequent to macrophage activation. Thus, we decided to study the effect of macrophage activation by immune complexes on N-LDL metabolism. Initially, LDL-containing immune complexes (LDL-IC) were chosen, since increased plasma levels of these IC have been reported in patients with coronary heart disease. Human macrophages stimulated for 22 h with LDL-IC (250 micrograms/ml) and incubated afterwards for 20 h with 10 micrograms/ml 125I-N-LDL showed a six- and fourfold increase in the accumulation and degradation, respectively, of 125I-N-LDL over the values observed in nonstimulated cells. Scatchard analysis of 125I-N-LDL-specific binding suggests an increase (20-fold) in the number of LDL receptors in macrophages stimulated with LDL-IC. We studied other immune complexes varying in size and antigen composition. Some of the IC were able to stimulate, although to a lesser degree, the uptake of N-LDL by macrophages. Lipoprotein IC are more efficient and have the greatest capacity to increase N-LDL uptake and CE accumulation. We conclude that human macrophage activation by LDL-IC leads to an increase in LDL receptor activity and promotes in vitro foam cell formation.

beta-endorphin	BE	Administration of gonadal steroids to neonatal rats has a profound effect on the function of the neuroendocrine system in the adult animal. Considering that gonadal steroids modulate hypothalamic and pituitary levels of beta-endorphin (BE) in adult male and female rats, the effects of neonatal gonadal steroid treatment on BE levels in the adult animal were investigated. Neonatal male rats were administered testosterone and neonatal female rats were treated with estrogen. Matched control littermates received vehicle. All animals were sacrificed at 90 days of age. Neonatal gonadal steroid treatment did not affect the level of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (IR-BE) in the anterior pituitary (AP) of male rats but did result in a significant increase in IR-BE in the AP of female rats. Neonatal administration of gonadal steroids produced a significant decrease in IR-BE in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary (NIL) of both male and female rats, with the magnitude of the decrease being greater in the NIL of the female rats. IR-BE levels in the hypothalamus of male or female rats were not altered by the treatments. Column chromatography indicated that the increase in IR-BE in the AP represented a proportional increase in BE and beta-lipotropin, while the reduction in IR-BE in the NIL of the treated rats represented a reduction in BE. These findings suggest that gonadal steroids may influence the development of the neurotransmitter systems which regulate BE levels in the adult pituitary, the development of the biosynthetic mechanisms of the adult pituitary, or both.

mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus	MTN	1. The effects of epileptogenic stimulation of the cerebral masticatory area on the somata of the first-order neurons of masticatory proprioception localized in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN) were studied in curarized, lightly anaesthetized rabbits. 2. Low-frequency stimulations inducing modest cortical after-discharges fired the silent MTN units with latencies of 0.3-0.8 sec, and induced alternate excitatory and inhibitory effects on the active units. On some occasions the tonic afferent discharge was changed into rhythmic bursts, which occurred at the constant frequency of 2.5-3.5/sec for the entire range of stimulation frequencies used, i.e. from 0.3 to 10/sec. 3. High-frequency cortical stimulations eliciting true epileptic seizures induced a transient increase in discharge of the MTN units, followed by a prolonged inhibition. 4. All these effects were attributed to activation of reticular pathways acting on the some of the recorded proprioceptive neurons. Such a modulation of the proprioceptive input elicited by the epileptic masticatory cortex may contribute to the motor effects and to the changes of the masseteric reflex which occur during convulsive seizures.
poly-(deoxythymidylic acid)	poly(dT)	There are at least two major conformations of recA nucleoprotein filaments formed on poly-(deoxythymidylic acid) [poly(dT)], one stabilized by ATP [or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S)] and one stabilized by ADP. Assembly of filaments in the ATP conformation is much faster than assembly in the ADP conformation. A third conformation may be present in the absence of nucleotides. The ATP and ADP conformations are mutually exclusive. When a mixture of ATP and ADP is present, recA protein binding is a function of the ADP/ATP ratio. Complete dissociation is observed when the ratio becomes 1.0-1.5. When a mixture of ATP and ADP is present at the beginning of a reaction, a transient phase lasting several minutes is observed in which the system approaches the state characteristic of the new ADP/ATP ratio. This phase is manifested by a lag in ATP hydrolysis when ATP is added to preformed ADP filaments, and by a burst in ATP hydrolysis in all other cases. More than 15 ATPs are hydrolyzed per bound recA monomer during the burst phase. The transient phase reflects an end-dependent disassembly process propagated longitudinally through the filament, rather than a slow conformation change in individual recA monomers or a slow exchange of one nucleotide for the other. The hysteresis exhibited by the system provides a number of insights relevant to the mechanism of recA-mediated DNA strand exchange.
ultrasonic diamond-coated	DC	AIM: This study compared the appearance of root-end cavity preparations and the time required to prepare them using prototype ultrasonic diamond-coated (DC) and stainless-steel (SS) retrotips. METHODOLOGY: In 12 maxillary and 12 mandibular molar teeth 48 root-end cavities were prepared ultrasonically in the palatal, mesio-buccal, distal and mesial root-ends using DC and SS retrotips, alternately. Replicas of the resected root tips and the root-end cavities were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), recording (i) incidence and extent of dentine cracks (ii) minimum remaining thickness of the dentine walls and (iii) surface quality of the resected root-ends. The time taken to complete the preparation was also recorded. Means of these parameters were compared for both types of retrotips using nonparametric tests. RESULTS: No resected root-ends had cracks before preparation. However, after preparation one root-end cavity shaped by an SS retrotip had a microcrack visible at 23x magnification. Four and seven other root-ends had crazed surfaces in the DC and SS groups, respectively (P > 0.05). Remaining minimum dentine thickness was 0.56 +/- 0.28 mm and 0.71 +/- 0.24 for the DC and SS groups, respectively, and this difference was significant (P < 0.05). A root-end cavity in one specimen in the DC group was perforated. Preparation times ranged from 25 s to 361 s and were significantly lower for DC tips (P < 0.01) than the SS tips. The time required to prepare root-end cavities also differed between roots; root-end preparation in mandibular molars was more time consuming. CONCLUSIONS: A better quality surface was produced by the prototype diamond-coated retrotips, in less time than the SS retrotips, which in turn caused fewer cracks than previously reported. DC retrotips removed more dentine than SS retrotips and should therefore be used with care to avoid overpreparation or perforation.

monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance	MGUS	The role of loss or inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb1) and p53 tumor suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies has been well established, yet little is known regarding plasma cell dyscrasias. In the present study, the loss of Rb1 protein expression, and the presence of Rb1 gene rearrangements as well as the presence of p53 somatic mutations (exons 5 through 9) were investigated in a panel of plasma cell dyscrasias, including 15 monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), 63 multiple myelomas (MM), and 18 plasma cell leukemias (PCL). In the same panel of cases, we established the frequency of ras oncogene mutations, the main genetic lesion associated with MM. We report that loss of Rb1 protein and p53 mutations are detectable in 34.7 and 9.8% of MM and PCL primary cases; no lesion was found in MGUS. In advanced stage MM, and PCL cases, Rb1 and p53 inactivation, as well as ras mutations were detected. Our findings show that Rb1 and p53 inactivation are associated with aggressive plasma cell dyscrasias, suggesting a role for these lesions in tumor progression rather than initiation.

Retinal ganglion cells	GC	Retinal ganglion cells (GC) of the Lamprey were studied after in vitro labeling of these cells by iontophoretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase into the optic nerve. The majority of GC are located at the boundary between the inner nuclear layer and the inner plexiform layer; a small proportion (20%) lies in the vitreous portion of the inner plexiform layer. Four types of GC were identified.
dry matter intake	DMI	This meta-analysis was undertaken to determine the impact of dietary components on dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield (MY), and milk protein yield (MPY) in Holstein dairy cows. Diets (n=846) from 256 feeding trials published in Volumes 73 through 83 of the Journal of Dairy Science were evaluated for nutrient composition using 2 diet evaluation models: CPM Dairy (a computer program based on the principles of the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System) and NRC (2001). Data were analyzed with and without the effect of stage of lactation as a dummy variable (<100 d in milk or > or =100 d in milk). A mixed model regression analysis was used to completely investigate the potential relationships among composition variables and DMI, MY, and MPY. Protein and carbohydrate fractions were the main components within the DMI models, and DMI played a dominant role in estimating MY and MPY. Inclusion of stage of lactation substantially improved the MY models but did not affect model fits or residual structure for DMI and MPY.

hepatitis B virus	HBV	Adults in the Stann Creek District of Belize have a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but the age of onset of these infections is unclear. We conducted a seroprevalence study of hepatitis B markers among Stann Creek school-age children to provide information for planning a hepatitis B vaccine program. The overall prevalence in 587 students was high for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) (43.3%) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (7.7%). There was marked variation of anti-HBc by school and by the predominant ethnic groups attending those schools. Maya had the highest prevalence (76%), followed by Mestizo (50%), Garifuna (37%), and Creole (25%). Children less than nine years of age attending the rural primary schools (mostly Mayan and Mestizo) had significantly higher prevalence of anti-HBc than did children attending the urban primary school (mostly Garifuna and Creole) (P < 0.05). Anti-HBc was found in 42% and 36% of students at the two high schools. Of the five schools tested, only at the urban primary school did anti-HBc positivity increase with age. Based on an analysis of the cost of serologic screening before immunization compared with mass vaccination, preimmunization serologic screening resulted in vaccine program cost savings in four of the five schools. Because most children in the rural areas contract hepatitis B before entering school, immunization against HBV should be integrated into the routine infant immunization program.

Chronic Aggressive Hepatitis	C.A.H.	During the period between January 1975 and August 1976, 203 liver biopsies were received at the Singapore General Hospital from patients with a variety of liver diseases. A histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis was made in 29 patients: 13 cases of Chronic Aggressive Hepatitis (C.A.H.). 10 cases Chronic Persistent Hepatitis (C.P.H.) and 6 of Chronic Lobular Hepatitis (C.L.H.). C.P.H. and C.L.H. were found mainly in the third and fourth decades. C.A.H. was more common in the fifth to seventh decades and occurred principally in females. Hepatitis B antigenaemia was detected in 48.3% of these cases using the immunoelectroosmophoresis (EOP) technique and showed an even scatter in all histological sub-types. Using the reverse passive haemagglutination (rPHA) method for detection by HBs antigen and the radioelectrocomplexing (REC) method for anti-HBs, an immune sub-group (HBs Ag+/anti-HBs+) was identified in greater proportions in C.A.H. and C.P.H. compared to normal controls. This was interpreted to mean that these patients suffered from a primary immunodeficiency characterized by failure of production of high avidity anti-HBs with resulting failure to clear HBsAg leading to perpetuation of liver damage due to circulating immune complexes. It is also suggested that patients with C.P.H. belonging to this immune sub-group may progress to C.A.H. with its more ominous prognosis.

sodium citrate	C	Eight subjects were studied on four occasions following ingestion of a 300-ml solution containing either sodium citrate (C, 0.4 g.kg-1 body mass) or placebo (P, sodium chloride 0.045 g.kg-1 body mass), at local barometric pressure (N, PB approximately 740 mmHg, 98.7 kPa) or hypobaric hypoxia (HH, PB = 463 mmHg, 61.7 kPa). At 2 h after ingestion of the solution, the subjects performed prolonged isometric knee-extension at 35% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) measured either in N or HH. Results showed that ingestion of C led to an improvement in muscle endurance (P < 0.01). However, this increase in endurance time for knee extensor muscles was only significant in N (+22%, P < 0.05, compared to +15%, NS, at N and HH, respectively). Following ingestion of sodium citrate, pre-exercise bicarbonate concentrations and pH levels were significantly higher than those measured after P ingestion. A significant treatment effect was observed for blood lactate concentrations with values higher for C than for P after 4, 6 and 10 min of recovery (P < 0.05). Electromyographic signals (EMG) were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle during the prolonged isometric contraction at 35% MVC. The mean power frequency (MPF) significantly decreased in time under both N-P and N-C conditions. In HH, no significant decrease in MPF was observed with time. The results suggest that C ingestion was an ergogenic aid enhancing endurance during a sustained isometric contraction. In addition, it is suggested that fatigue during prolonged isometric contraction in HH was not directly related to factors determining the EMG signs of fatigue.

hemodialysis	HD	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a model for hemodialysis (HD) in small animals using conventional dialysis equipment that would allow the intravital microscopic observation of leukocyte-endothelial interactions in vivo. METHODS: Cuprophan dialyzers were adapted to obtain a similar ratio of membrane area to blood volume as in clinical HD. A silicone ring was inserted into the dialyzer's inlet to limit the number of blood-perfused capillaries. Rabbits were dialyzed for one hour without a dialysate flow. RESULTS: Extracorporeal circulation with the cuprophan dialyzer resulted in a transient leukopenia and complement activation. At the nadir of leukopenia, leukocytes that rolled along the venular wall were scarcely observed, whereas rolling was abundant (54 +/- 9 per min) prior to extracorporeal circulation. The adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium was not induced. After 60 minutes, rolling of leukocytes was still reduced by 73 +/- 5.5%, despite the full recovery of circulating leukocyte counts. Extracorporeal circulation without a dialyzer also tended to reduce leukocyte rolling, although systemic leukocyte counts were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: The use of adapted conventional cuprophan hemodialyzers in rabbits yielded a transient leukopenia similar to that in clinical HD. Using intravital microscopy, we demonstrated impairment of leukocyte-endothelial interactions. In addition, our data indicate that tissues, in which leukocytes can roll and adhere, are not automatically sites of leukocyte sequestration during HD-induced leukopenia.
magnetic resonance	MR	PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic efficacy of a standard and cumulative triple dose of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent in the evaluation of brain metastases using a high-field 3.0 T MR unit versus a standard field 1.5 T MR unit. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with suspected brain metastases were examined at both field strengths using identical postcontrast coronal 3D gradient echo with magnetization preparation, which was adjusted separately for each field strength. In both groups initially, iv injection of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium chelate (gadodiamide) and thereafter, 0.2 mmol/kg body weight gadodiamide were administered. Subjective assessment of the images was performed independently by 3 neuroradiologists. Objective measurement of signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios was obtained. RESULTS: The subjective assessment of cumulative triple-dose 3.0 T images obtained the best results compared with other sequences, detecting 84 metastases, followed by 1.5 T cumulative triple-dose enhanced images with 81 brain metastases. The objective assessment confirmed those results, showing significantly higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios with 3.0 T than with 1.5 T. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative triple-dose images of both field strengths were superior to standard field strengths. However, administration of gadodiamide contrast agent produces higher contrast between tumor and normal brain on 3.0 T than on 1.5 T, resulting in better detection of brain metastases and leptomeningeal involvement.
unstable coronary artery disease	CAD	On exercise testing after an episode of unstable coronary artery disease (CAD; unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), a proportion of patients show ST-segment depression, indicating myocardial ischaemia, but do not report concomitant symptoms of angina. Treatment of such "silent" ischaemia aims mainly to reduce the risk of subsequent cardiac events. We have studied the effect of low-dose aspirin in patients with myocardial ischaemia defined at the predischarge test as silent (though patients might have had symptomatic ischaemia at other times) or symptomatic. 740 men with unstable CAD aged 70 years or less underwent symptom-limited exercise testing before hospital discharge; 144 showed ST depression without pain and 230 ST depression with simultaneous chest pain. Of the silent ischaemia group, 67 were randomly assigned placebo and 77 aspirin (75 mg daily); the corresponding numbers in the symptomatic group were 125 and 105. Angina symptoms were less common in the silent than in the symptomatic ischaemia group both before inclusion and during follow-up, and a greater proportion of the silent ischaemia group were included because of myocardial infarction. In both ischaemia groups aspirin treatment reduced the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or death by 3 months' follow-up (silent 4% of aspirin-treated vs 21% of placebo-treated patients, p = 0.004; symptomatic 9% vs 18%, p = 0.05); at 12 months' follow-up a significant benefit of aspirin was still apparent in the silent ischaemia group (9% vs 28%, p = 0.005) but not in the symptomatic group (13% vs 22%, p = 0.109). Low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction at least as well in silent as in symptomatic myocardial ischaemia. Since improvement of outlook is the main treatment objective in symptom-free patients, aspirin should be a mainstay of their treatment.
protein kinase C	PKC	The role of protein kinase C (PKC) and their isoforms in cell growth regulation remains elusive. Here we showed that in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), the PKC stimulator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in response to the growth factor PDGF associated with downregulation of PDGFbeta (but not alpha) receptors, which was recovered to normal level after PKC was depleted. The changes in PDGFbeta receptor were inversely correlated with PKCbeta1 protein levels regulated by PMA. The downregulation of PDGFbeta receptor by PMA was fully prevented by the PKCbeta inhibitor LY379196, however, without recovery of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation to PDGF. In contrast, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was fully recovered after depletion of PKCs. These results indicate that in human SMC PKCbeta1 mediates PDGFbeta receptor downregulation. Other PKC isoforms activated by phorbol ester also contribute to the inhibitory effects on cell growth.

Papillon-Lefevre syndrome	PLS	A 14-year-old boy with typical features of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is presented. The purpose of this report was to study the immunopheno-typic features of the peripheral blood and gingival tissue lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies in the patient. Peripheral blood T-cells, helper-T cells, suppressor-T cells, HLA-DR+ cells and IL-2R+ cells were determined using appropriate monoclonal antibodies and indirect immunofluorescence methods. B-cells were identified using the direct immunofluorescence technique. The gingival tissue was processed for both histopathological and immunohistological examinations. Gingival tissue lymphocytes were identified using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with the immunoperoxidase technique. Although we have not detected any significant alterations in the peripheral blood B-cell and T-cell populations, NK cells were significantly increased. HLA-DR+ cells and IL-2R+ cells were within normal limits. Histopathology of the diseased tissue revealed predominance of plasma cells in the lamina propria. The majority of the plasma cells were bearing IgG isotype. Most of the CD3+ T-cells were located beneath the pocket epithelium with an almost equal distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, in situ. These findings indicate that PLS is a IgG+ plasma cell dominated lesion with the participation of T-lymphocytes, having similar distributions of both subsets. While the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome still has to be elucidated, these immunohistological findings could be used for further studies in this intriguing entity.
N-n-propylpiperidine	3-PPP	The caudate spindle in rats was observed following bilateral application of apomorphine (1.5-50 micrograms) and (+/-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine (3-PPP, 0.3-3 micrograms) into the striatum. The smallest dose (1.5 micrograms) of apomorphine enhanced the spindle whereas with a larger dose (50 micrograms), suppression occurred. The preferential dopamine (DA) autoreceptor (inhibitory-receptor) agonist, (+/-)-3-PPP, enhanced the spindle, in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancing effect of apomorphine (1.5 micrograms) and (+/-)-3-PPP (3 micrograms) was prevented by neuroleptics, such as haloperidol (20 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and sulpiride (2 mg/kg, i.v.) at doses which, per se, did not affect the spindle. Small doses of neuroleptics are thought to block DA autoreceptors, suggesting that the enhancing effects of the DA agonists are mediated by autoreceptors. These results lend further support to the assumption that the development of the caudate spindle involves activation or DA receptors. Enhancement of the spindle, induced by injections of apomorphine into the striatum (small dose) and (+/-)-3-PPP, may be mediated by DA autoreceptors (inhibitory-receptors) located at presynaptic elements of the nigro-striatal DA system, while suppression may be due to stimulation of the postsynaptic DA receptors.

confocal scanning laser microscopy	CSLM	The morphology and ultrastructure of the larval spiracle system of three phlebotomine sandfly species, Phlebotomus perniciosus, P. perfiliewi and P. papatasi, were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy and by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). During larval development, thoracic and abdominal spiracles show considerable modifications. In fourth instar larvae, the spiracles consist of a plate with a sclerotized central portion and a peripheral circle of papillae. The latter is distinctive in the larvae of P. papatasi, which are readily distinguished from the other species. Opening clefts across the papillae communicate with an internal chamber that encircles an electrondense plug. Many cylindrical projections cross the chamber, uniting the central plug with the larval body, forming an air filter. Spiracular development in successive larval instars has both a taxonomic and adaptive value.
Thin-layer chromatography	TLC	Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with on-line detection of radioactive steroids were applied to identify metabolites of [4-14C]progesterone incubated in vitro with prawn ovary. There was extensive metabolism of progesterone by stage II (vitellogenic) ovary of Penaeus monodon. The most abundant metabolites were 5 alpha-pregnane derivatives together with two minor metabolites, 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one and 1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione. In contrast, a much lower level of progesterone metabolism was observed in stage 0 (immature) ovary of this species. The hepatopancreas, gill, and abdominal muscle of P. monodon all metabolised [4-14C]progesterone to varying degrees, generating materials similar to those produced by the ovary. A comparative study of progesterone metabolism in stage II ovary of Nephrops norvegicus indicated that one metabolite, 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, was produced.

All-trans-retinoic acid	ATRA	All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) shows anti-cancer activities, especially in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Due to the highly variable bioavailability of ATRA and induction of its own metabolism after oral treatment, development of alternative parenteral dosage form is required. The principal aim of this study was to develop a parenteral formulation of ATRA by overcoming its solubility limitation by utilizing phospholipid-based microemulsion system as a carrier. Microemulsion was prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients such as soybean oil and phospholipids. The mean particle diameter and polydispersity of ATRA microemulsion could be decreased to be applicable for parenteral administration by modulation of composition of microemulsion. The loading concentration of ATRA in microemulsion increased by increasing the oil contents and also by inclusion of distearoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine-N-poly(ethyleneglycol) 2000 (DSPE-PEG). Furthermore, loading of ATRA in microemulsion improved the chemical stability of ATRA. The pharmacokinetic profile of ATRA after intravenous injection of microemulsion formulation to rats was similar to that of sodium ATRA. The growth inhibitory effects of ATRA on human cancer HL-60 and MCF-7 cell lines were also similar between free ATRA and microemulsion formulation of ATRA, suggesting that its anti-cancer activity was not impaired by loading in microemulsion. Our study herein demonstrates that phospholipid-based microemulsion may provide an alternative parenteral formulation of ATRA.

wild type	WT	The Arabidopsis thaliana ascorbate-deficient vtc-1 mutant has only 30% ascorbate contents of the wild type (WT). This ascorbate-deficient mutant was used here to study the physiological roles of ascorbate under salt stress in vivo. Salt stress resulted in a more significant decrease in CO2 assimilatory capacity in the vtc-1 mutant than in the WT. Photosystem II function in the Arabidopsis vtc-1 mutant also showed an increased sensitivity to salt stress. Oxidative stress, indicated by the hydrogen peroxide content, increased more dramatically in the vtc-1 mutant than in the WT under salt stress. To clarify the reason for the increased oxidative stress in the vtc-1 mutant, the contents of small antioxidant compounds and the activities of several antioxidant enzymes in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle were measured. Despite an elevated glutathione pool in the vtc-1 mutant, the ascorbate contents and the reduced form of ascorbate decreased very rapidly under salt stress. These results showed that the activities of MDAR and DHAR were lower in the vtc-1 mutant than in the WT under salt stress. Thus, low intrinsic ascorbate and an impaired ascorbate-glutathione cycle in the vtc-1 mutant under salt stress probably induced a dramatic decrease in the reduced form of ascorbate, which resulted in both enhanced ROS contents and decreased NPQ in the vtc-1 mutant.
sudden infant death	SID	Hyperexplexia is a disease of neonatal onset characterized by an exaggerated startle reflex. Early diagnosis is important to rule out epilepsy. Clinical findings are mainly hypertony and generalized startle reflex which is exaggerated by tiredness and some exogenous stimuli. Electroencephalogram is normal. The expression of the disease is variable including minor forms that may be unnoticed and major forms with arthrogryposis-like symptoms, orthopedic complications, false passages, apnea and even sudden infant death (SID). The evolution is generally benign and symptoms disappear within 2 or 3 years. A neuromotor retardation is often present, without intellectual deficit. In severe forms, the risk of SID requires a multidisciplinary follow-up including monitoring and treatment with clonazepam. A low GABA level in cerebrospinal fluid has been reported. Present etiological hypotheses include neuromediator and/or receptor dysfunction.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 1	TNF-alphaIP1	AIM: To compare the gene expression profile in a pair of HBV-infected twins. METHODS: The gene expression profile was compared in a pair of HBV-infected twins. RESULTS: The twins displayed different disease outcomes. One acquired natural immunity against HBV, whereas the other became a chronic HBV carrier. Eighty-eight and forty-six genes were found to be up- or down-regulated in their PBMCs, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 1 (TNF-alphaIP1) that expressed at a higher level in the HBV-immune twins was identified and four pairs of siblings with HBV immunity by RT-PCR. However, upon HBV core antigen stimulation, TNF-alphaIP1 was downregulated in PBMCs from subjects with immunity, whereas it was slightly upregulated in HBV carriers. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a K+ channel tetramerization domain in TNF-alphaIP1 that shares a significant homology with some human, mouse, and C elegan proteins. CONCLUSION: TNF-alphaIP1 may play a role in the innate immunity against HBV.
triglyceride	TG	The effects of pH and temperature on benzo[a]pyrene(BaP)-DNA, -protein, and -lipid adducts were compared in rat hepatocytes treated with [3H]-BaP. In primary rat hepatocytes, BaP-DNA, -protein, and -lipid adducts were formed in a concentration-dependent manner (0.31-2.80 mmol BaP), and the formation of BaP-lipid adducts, specifically triglyceride (TG) adducts, correlated well with that of DNA or protein adducts. As incubation time increased (1-24 h), the formation of DNA or protein adducts was also elevated, while BaP-TG adducts decreased after 3 h of reaction. pH had no effect on the formation of [3H]-BaP-DNA, and -protein adducts, and the TG adducts decreased with increasing pH (3.4-11.4). With an increase in incubation temperature (30-45 degrees C), on the other hand, the adduct formation was increased with increasing temperature up to 40 degrees C and then decreased sharply. These results suggest that the physicochemical properties of BaP-DNA, -protein, and -TG adducts might be important to consider when cells or humans who have been exposed to BaP are monitored for biomarkers.
respiratory syncytial virus	RSV	A distinct clinical presentation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection of humans is bronchiolitis, which has clinical features similar to those of asthma. Substance P (SP), a tachykinin neuropeptide, has been associated with neurogenic inflammation and asthma; therefore, we chose to examine SP-induced inflammation with RSV infection. In this study, we examined the production of pulmonary SP associated with RSV infection of BALB/c mice and the effect of anti-SP F(ab)(2) antibodies on the pulmonary inflammatory response. The peak production of pulmonary SP occurred between days 3 and 5 following primary RSV infection and day 1 after secondary infection. Treatment of RSV-infected mice with anti-SP F(ab)(2) antibodies suggested that SP may alter the natural killer cell response to primary and secondary infection. In mice challenged after formalin-inactivated RSV vaccination, SP appears to markedly enhance pulmonary eosinophilia as well as increase polymorphonuclear cell trafficking to the lung. Based on studies with a strain of RSV that lacks the G and SH genes, the SP response to RSV infection appears to be associated with G and/or SH protein expression. These data suggest that SP may be an important contributor to the inflammatory response to RSV infection and that anti-SP F(ab)(2) antibodies might be used to ameliorate RSV-associated disease.

tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate	TPA	The influence of initiator dose and promoter dose, duration, and type on the progression of papillomas to carcinomas was examined in Sencar mice. A good dose-response relationship for promotion of papilloma formation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [following initiation with 6.5 micrograms of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)] was observed in the range of 0.125 to 2.0 micrograms/mouse. A maximal papilloma response was induced with 2 micrograms/mouse (24 papillomas/mouse). When adjusted for mortality, the carcinoma incidence after 60 wk of promotion was essentially the same (approximately 80%) for doses above 0.5 micrograms/mouse. In a related experiment, mice were given an initiation dose of either 2 or 20 micrograms of DMBA followed by applications of 2 micrograms of TPA for 3, 5, 7, or 60 wk. Papilloma formation was proportional to length of treatment, with a maximum of 29 papillomas/mouse (20-micrograms initiating dose of DMBA) and 10 papillomas/mouse (2-micrograms initiating dose of DMBA) occurring between 10 and 15 wk of promotion. In this experiment, the carcinoma incidence was clearly proportional to the duration of promoter treatment at the low initiation dose of DMBA. The carcinoma incidence, on the other hand, was similar (approximately 70%) in groups of mice given an initiation dose of 20 micrograms of DMBA and promotion treatment for greater than or equal to 5 wk. Thus, the initiator dose had a dramatic effect on the outcome of these experiments. Additional experiments were performed to compare tumor progression with the anthrone promoter, chrysarobin. At optimal promoting doses, chrysarobin treatment produced a maximum number of papillomas that was approximately 1/3 that produced by TPA (6.4 versus 17.0 papillomas per mouse, respectively). However, the carcinoma response was very similar in these two treatment groups, confirming previous work from this laboratory. In addition, chrysarobin treatment following 10 wk of TPA promotion did not enhance the progression of preexisting papillomas to carcinomas. The data presented in this paper are consistent with a model in which several types or stages of papillomas are initially produced during two-stage carcinogenesis in mouse skin with different probabilities of progressing to carcinomas. However, the data indicate that optimal doses of promoter and initiator exist and can influence interpretation of tumor progression studies in mouse skin.

gamma-aminobutyric acid	GABA	At least three high affinity Na+- and Cl--dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters are known to exist in the rat and mouse brain. These transporters share 50-65% amino acid sequence identity with the kidney betaine transporter which also transports GABA but with lower affinity. The betaine transporter (BGT) is expressed on the basolateral surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Recent evidence suggests that the signals and mechanisms involved in membrane protein sorting share many functional characteristics in polarized neurons and epithelial cells. It was previously shown that the rat GABA transporter GAT-1 is located in the presynaptic membrane of axons where it plays a role in terminating GABAergic neurotransmission. When expressed in MDCK cells by transfection, GAT-1 was sorted to the apical membrane. In this report, we have localized the other two GABA transporters, GAT-2 and GAT-3, in transfected MDCK cells by GABA uptake, immunofluorescence, and cell surface biotinylation. GAT-3, like GAT-1, localized to the apical membrane of MDCK cells while GAT-2, like BGT, localized to the basolateral membrane. We have also expressed BGT in low density cultures of hippocampal neurons by microinjection and immunolocalized it to the dendrites. The distribution of GAT-3 in these neurons after transfection was axonal as well as somatodendritic. These results indicate that highly homologous subtypes of GABA transporters are sorted differently when expressed in epithelial cells or neurons and suggest that these two cell types share the capacity to distinguish among these isoforms and target them to distinct destinations.

systemic lupus erythematosus	SLE	Almost seventy percent of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients produce autoantibodies specific for U1 RNA, the RNA component of the U1snRNP complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Human anti-U1 RNA antibodies from SLE patients provide an ideal model for studying protein-RNA interactions. In addition, a more in depth look at the mechanism by which an antibody interacts with U1 RNA will lend insight into immune disregulation and may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of autoimmune disease. The possibility of cloning an anti-U1 RNA antibody has been investigated using "phage Fab display," a method involving the display of Fab fragments on the outer surface of filamentous phage. Human Fab cDNA libraries were constructed using total RNA collected from leukophoresed anti-U1 RNA antibody-positive SLE patient sera. The resulting Fab genes were subcloned into a phagemid expression vector which produced phage displaying Fab fragments in E.coli1. Libraries were enriched for U1 RNA-binding clones after several rounds of affinity selection against purified, in vitro transcribed U1 RNA. Putative U1 RNA-binding clones were identified by colony lift and the corresponding Fab genes were expressed and purified from E.coli for binding studies. Results demonstrate that RNA-binding Fab can be isolated from combinatorial phage display libraries.
Extracellular-superoxide dismutase	EC-SOD	Extracellular-superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is heterogenous in the vasculature with regard to heparin affinity and can be separated into three fractions: A, without affinity; B, with weak affinity; and C, with relatively strong heparin affinity. The plasma clearance of intravenously injected 125I-labeled and unlabeled human EC-SOD C was studied in rabbits. About 90% of injected 125I-EC-SOD C was eliminated from the blood within 5-10 min. Injection of heparin after 10 or 20 min led to an immediate release of all sequestered 125I-EC-SOD C back to the blood plasma. Later injections of heparin led to diminished release, although release could still be demonstrated after 72 h. A half-time of approximately 10 h could be calculated for heparin-releasable 125I-EC-SOD C. Unlabeled EC-SOD C, determined as enzymic activity and with ELISA, was likewise sequestered and released to the same degree as 125I-labeled EC-SOD C by heparin as tested at 20 min and 5 h. The immediacy of the heparin-induced release indicates that the sequestered enzyme had been bound to endothelial cell surfaces. The length of the half-time suggests that the putative cell surface binding has a physiological function and is not primarily a step in enzyme degradation. The distribution of sequestered 125I-labeled EC-SOD C to different organs was determined at times between 10 min and 24 h. Of the organs, the liver contained the most 125I-EC-SOD C, followed by kidney, spleen, heart, and lung. At all investigated times, the content in the analyzed organs was nearly as large as the amount that could be promptly released to plasma by intravenous heparin. This indicates that almost all 125I-EC-SOD C in the organs was present on endothelial cell surfaces and was not bound by other tissue cell surfaces, or was present within the cells.
activated carbon	FGAC	A new, low-cost fiber glass supported activated carbon (FGAC) filter has been prepared that displays enhanced adsorption characteristics for the removal of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-xylene) from water to below maximum contaminant level (MCL) regulated by USEPA and two chemical warfare agent simulants (diisopropylmethyl phosphonate and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide) to barely detectable levels. Breakthrough curves for both the FGAC filter and a commercially available granular activated carbon (GAC) filter containing equal weights of adsorbent show that the FGAC filter has greatly improved kinetics of adsorption over the GAC filter for all six chemical contaminants. Benzene breakthrough curves showed the FGAC filter effluent to contain less than one ppb as compared to several parts per million in the GAC filter effluent. This was 2 orders of magnitude better than the GAC and represents a major advance in generating good water quality for the military as well as the general public. The FGAC filter showed a much lower pressure drop and could be completely regenerated at least 6 times by heating to 190 degrees C under vacuum.

Benzene breakthrough curves showed the FGAC filter effluent to contain less than one ppb as compared to several parts per million in the GAC filter effluent. This was 2 orders of magnitude better than the GAC and represents a major advance in generating good water quality for the military as well as the general public. The FGAC filter showed a much lower pressure drop and could be completely regenerated at least 6 times by heating to 190 degrees C under vacuum.

cardiopulmonary bypass	CPB	Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) require anticoagulation with heparin to avoid thrombosis within the bypass circuit. The common method used to monitor the degree of anticoagulation is the activated clotting time (ACT). We evaluated a novel point of care device, the TAS (Pharmanetics, Raleigh, NC, USA) heparin management test (HMT), for its suitability in monitoring anticoagulation during CPB. In vitro analysis showed a dose-response (r2=0.988) of the HMT from 0.078-10.0 U/ml heparin, covering the range of heparin used during cardiac surgery (2-5 U/ml). Fifty randomly selected patients undergoing CPB were studied. Preheparin clotting times for these patients were 143+/-32 s for the HMT and 146+/-18 s for the ACT; 435+/-60 s HMT and 438+/-39 s ACT during CPB; 145+/-50 s HMT and 128+/-14 s ACT post-protamine (r2=0.797). epsilon-Aminocaproic acid treatment for inhibition of fibrinolysis did not affect the HMT. We conclude that the HMT correlates well with the ACT and may be useful for monitoring heparin during CPB. Advantages of the HMT are small sample volume and good sensitivity to heparin.

prostaglandin E1	PGE1	The effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) administered either intraarterially or intravenously on basal fluid secretion from the lacrimal gland after various treatments was studied in anaesthetized rabbits. Intraarterial administration of either propranolol (1 mg/kg) or phentolamine (1 mg/kg) effectively prevented secretion induced by PGE1 but not by methacholine. Pretreatment with hexamethonium (1 mg/kg) markedly inhibited PGE1-mediated lacrimal flow whereas methacholine-induced secretion was not affected. The secretory response to PGE1 was completely blocked after section of postganglionic fibres of the ipsilateral superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. On the other hand, preganglionic sympathectomy had no effect on secretion evoked by PGE1. The effect of PGE1 was independent of the route of administration. The results are discussed in terms of stimulation of postganglionic sympathetic nerves by PGE1 to release noradrenaline. The latter, in turn, elicits fluid secretion by a process (or processes) involving activation of beta-receptors, most likely, on the secretory acinar cells.
basal keratinocytes	BK	Two monoclonal antibodies, K20 and 4B4, assigned to the CDw29 cluster of differentiation antigens, were shown to react with basal keratinocytes (BK). The aim of this study was to identify the antigens recognized by K20 and 4B4 on epidermal cells, and to determine whether they were identical to those found on lymphocytes. Basal keratinocyte-enriched cell suspensions were labelled with 125I and then 1% NP40 cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Under reducing conditions, K20 and 4B4 immunoprecipitated from basal keratinocytes a broad MW 105,000 band and proteins of MW 145,000, 90,000 and 80,000. Under non-reducing conditions, each band was shifted down by approximately 5000 MW. Metabolic labelling studies demonstrated that the MW 145,000 and 105,000 subunits were synthesized by basal keratinocytes. On lymphoid cells, K20 and 4B4 are known to precipitate glycoprotein complexes made of a broad MW 130,000 protein band (beta subunit) associated with a protein of MW 150,000 (alpha subunit) and proteins of MW 90,000 and 80,000 expressed in very low amounts. The MW 145,000 and 105,000 bands immunoprecipitated by K20 from basal keratinocytes correspond to the alpha and beta subunits present on lymphoid cells. It has recently been demonstrated that K20 recognizes the common beta subunit of the very late antigens family (VLA) and that 4B4 defines the helper-inducer subset of T lymphocytes. The present investigation provides evidence that basal keratinocytes share antigens of the VLA family with lymphoid cells and that they play an important role in the immune response in the skin-immune system.

penicilloylated bovine IgG	BPO-BGG	The in vitro T-cell proliferation induced by penicilloylated bovine IgG (BPO-BGG) in sensitized strain 2 guinea pigs could be specifically blocked by the serum of guinea pig (*305) which had been repeatedly immunized with BPO-BGG over a period of 9 mo. The antibodies which appeared in the serum of this animal (*305) were functionally similar to the strain 2 anti-idiotypic antibodies (a strain 2 BPO-BGG) raised by immunizing strain 2 guinea pigs with immuno-adsorbent column-purified BPO-BGG. Animal *305 had no detectable antibodies to BPO-BGG and failed to give a delayed hypersensitivity skin response when challenged with BPO-BGG.
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone	LH-RH	To study the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH; luliberin) receptors in the rat anterior pituitary gland and ovary, 125I-labeled [D-Ser(TBU)6des-Gly-NH2(10)]LH-RH ethylamide was used as a labeled ligand. The binding characteristics were assessed by Scatchard analysis of labeled ligand binding and by potency displacement with unlabeled peptides. Similar Kd values, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 nM, were found for the labeled and unlabeled peptides in both tissues. A similar order of potency was observed between the finding affinity of 15 peptides in anterior pituitary and ovarian homogenates and their biological activity on luteinizing hormone release in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture. These data demonstrate that the LH-RH receptors present in the rat ovary have a specificity similar to that of the anterior pituitary LH-RH receptor controlling secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Moreover, the binding affinities of the LH-RH agonists and antagonists can account, at least up to a large extent, for their relative biological potencies. Although there definitely are specific LH-RH receptors in the ovary which may play a role in the antifertility effects observed after administration of LH-RH agonists, the possible physiological significance of these ovarian receptors is still unknown and of great biological interest.
Symplastic spermatids	sys	Chimaeric analysis is a powerful method to address questions about the cell-autonomous nature of defects in spermatogenesis. Symplastic spermatids (sys) mice have a recessive mutation that causes male sterility due to an arrest in germ-cell development during spermiogenesis. Chimaeric mice were generated by aggregation of eight-cell embryos from sys (FVB/N genetic background) and wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice to determine whether the male germ-cell defect is cell-autonomous. The resulting FVB/N<->B6 chimaeras (<-> denotes fusion of embryos) were mated with FVB/N mice and coat colour of offspring was used to identify transmission of FVB/N or B6 gametes. Regardless of the relative contribution of B6 to somatic tissues of the chimaeras, almost all (282 of 284; 99.3%) offspring of B6 XY<->XY FVB/N (+/+ or sys/+) males (n = 9) received a FVB/N-derived paternal gamete. After mating of female B6<->FVB/N chimaeras, 51 of 73 (69.9%) offspring received an FVB-derived maternal gamete. Southern blot analysis of different tissues from chimaeric males indicated that, despite the presence of balanced chimaerism in somatic tissues, the germ line in B6 XY<->XY FVB/N mice was essentially FVB/N in composition. Thus there is a strong selective advantage for FVB/N male germ cells over B6 male germ cells in B6<->FVB/N-aggregation chimaeras at some stage during development of the male germ line. Each of three male chimaeras that were either B6 XY<->XY FVB/N (sys/sys) or B6 XX<->XY FVB/N (sys/sys) in composition was sterile, and testis histology was essentially sysmutant. This finding indicates that the function of the gene(s) affected in the sys mutation may be required in the testis, although whether expression is required in germ cells, somatic cells or both remains unknown. The extreme bias in transmission of male gametes has implications for experimental design in studies that use chimaeric analysis to address questions regarding the cell-autonomous nature of germ-cell defects in mice.
computerized tomography	CT	Intrapericardial teratoma is a rare mediastinal tumor that originates from aberrant clusters of multipotential cells from three germinal layers. Previous reports have used the combination of cardiac angiography, CT scan, and echocardiogram to establish the diagnosis prior to surgery. We report a case of intrapericardial teratoma diagnosed noninvasively and removed surgically within the first three days of life. Furthermore, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography and computerized tomography (CT), and discuss the superiority of noninvasive evaluation in the management of these critically ill infants.
Hashimoto thyroiditis	HT	The coincidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a commonly observed phenomenon in western New York. Previous literature suggested that there may be a direct relationship between them. We undertook these studies to determine whether humoral or cell-mediated mechanisms might link HT and CIU. Skin biopsies from patients with CIU, with or without HT, were indistinguishable by light microscopy. No immune complex deposition was observed, although only the skin from patients with CIU and HT contained perivascular fibrin deposits. Similarly, immunohistochemical studies evaluating cellular expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and CD68 failed to differentiate between CIU with or without HT. Analysis of Vbeta restriction in thyroid tissue of patients with HT and the skin of patients with CIU and HT by in situ polymerase chain reaction failed to reveal any oligoclonal T-lymphocyte subpopulations. In contrast, only patients with CIU and HT had anti-FcepsilonRI antibodies in their sera that could induce degranulation of normal basophils. Some sera from patients with CIU and HT caused degranulation of normal basophils in the absence of anti-FceRI. The factor causing basophil degranulation in these sera was not determined. Patients with CIU and HT failed to improve clinically with thyroid replacement therapy. All CIU patients were equally well managed with symptomatic therapies. In conclusion, HT likely represents a marker of other autoimmunity, rather than being a direct causative agent in CIU. Management of CIU, with or without HT and with or without anti-FceRI antibodies, should be the same. Future studies will have to examine whether cell-mediated responses participate in CIU, especially in association with HT.

metal response element-binding transcription factor-1	MTF-1	Mouse metal response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) regulates the transcription of genes in response to a variety of stimuli, including exposure to zinc or cadmium, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. Each of these stresses may increase labile cellular zinc, leading to nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation of metallothionein genes (MT genes) by MTF-1. Several lines of evidence suggest that the highly conserved six-zinc finger DNA-binding domain of MTF-1 also functions as a zinc-sensing domain. In this study, we investigated the potential role of the peptide linkers connecting the four N-terminal zinc fingers of MTF-1 in their zinc-sensing function. Each of these three linkers is unique, completely conserved among all known vertebrate MTF-1 orthologs, and different from the canonical Cys2His2 zinc finger TGEKP linker sequence. Replacing the RGEYT linker between zinc fingers 1 and 2 with TGEKP abolished the zinc-sensing function of MTF-1, resulting in constitutive DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation of the MT-I gene. In contrast, swapping the TKEKP linker between fingers 2 and 3 with TGEKP had little effect on the metal-sensing functions of MTF-1, whereas swapping the canonical linker for the shorter TGKT linker between fingers 3 and 4 rendered MTF-1 less sensitive to zinc-dependent activation both in vivo and in vitro. These observations suggest a mechanism by which physiological concentrations of accessible cellular zinc affect MTF-1 activity. Zinc may modulate highly specific, linker-mediated zinc finger interactions in MTF-1, thus affecting its zinc- and DNA-binding activities, resulting in translocation to the nucleus and binding to the MT-I gene promoter.

epidermal growth factor	EGF	The origin of rat urinary epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been investigated. Unilateral nephrectomy decreased the concentration, total output of EGF and EGF/creatinine ratio by approximately 50%, while the output of creatinine was unchanged. Removal of the submandibular glands and duodenal Brunner's glands, organs known to produce EGF, had no influence on the output of EGF in urine. Renal clearance of EGF exceeded that of creatinine, and after bilateral nephrectomy or bilateral ligation of the ureters, the concentration of creatinine in serum increased, while the concentration of EGF was below the detection limit of the assay. Renal production of EGF was confirmed by immunohistochemistry demonstrating EGF immunoreactivity in the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. EGF in the submandibular glands and in urine was found to differ with chromatofocusing and reverse-phase HPLC. At isoelectric focusing the pI of submandibular EGF was 4.8 and 5.4 while that of urinary EGF was 5.3 and 6.4. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that urinary EGF mainly originates from the kidneys and is localized to the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus.
malondialdehyde	MDA	N-(2-propenal)ethanolamine was isolated from rat and human urine using anion exchange, cation exchange, size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the isolate yielded malondialdehyde (MDA) and ethanolamine (E) in a 1:1 molar ratio. A 1:1 E-MDA adduct was synthesized and found to be chromatographically inseparable from the urinary metabolite. Its NMR and UV spectra and lack of fluorescence were consistent with those of an enaminal formed by a Schiff's base reaction. The identification in urine of an adduct of MDA with ethanolamine, and the previous identification of an adduct with serine, constitutes direct evidence for the oxidative decomposition in vivo of polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the relevant phospholipids. The absence in urine of MDA adducts with other alpha-amino compounds (at least in comparable amounts) indicates that the ethanolamine and serine derivatives are formed in situ and not as a result of reactions with MDA generated in enzymatic processes.

Abstinence Violation Effect	AVE	Recent work in smoking cessation has focused on cognitive factors related to relapse and maintenance. The present investigation utilized an established self-efficacy-based questionnaire to determine whether sex, length of smoking history, successful quitting attempts, and environmental events affected subjects' perceived confidence of resisting smoking urges. It was hypothesized that: (a) subjects with fewer years smoking would have higher self-efficacy than those smoking for longer periods; (b) reported self-efficacy would be lowest for those situations involving negative moods; and (c) successful quitters would report higher self-efficacy than unsuccessful quitters. The second and third hypotheses were strongly confirmed, and a nonsignificant tendency in the expected direction was found for the first hypothesis. The results were generally consistent with the self-efficacy and the Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE) models.
recombinant interferon gamma	rIFN-gamma	Many factors induce or enhance expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules on various cell types. Human T lymphocytes are class II negative in the resting state but show expression of class II molecules following activation. We analyzed the modulating capacity of the lymphokines recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) on class II expression in subsets of alloactivated human T lymphocytes. The activated CD4+ T cells expressed all three class II isotypes (DR, DQ, and DP), whereas the cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lines expressed DR and DP molecules but failed to bind DQ-specific monoclonal antibodies significantly. Treatment with rIFN-gamma and IL-4 had no effect on class II expression on any of the T-cell lines or clones, whereas rTNF-alpha enhanced class II expression in both subsets. rTNF-alpha could modulate expression of all three class II isotypes but, in principle, it appears only to affect ongoing class II synthesis as de novo synthesis of class II molecules with a resultant change in the class II phenotype from DR+ DQ- DP+ to DR+ DQ+ DP+ in the CD8+ T lymphocytes was not observed. No synergic effects of rINF-gamma and rTNF-alpha were observed; this results from the fact that activated T cells express few, if any, receptors of rIFN-gamma.

human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	We have investigated the level of lymphocytosis present in the lung of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1+ infected patients with and without pulmonary disease and how changes in natural killer (NK), B and T-cells seen in peripheral blood (PB) compare with those seen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lymphocyte subpopulations and their expression of activation, cytotoxic markers and memory status were characterized by triple immunofluorescence. Macrophages accounted for over 80% of the BAL cells. Only three out of 72 patients had a lymphocyte percentage >30%. No statistically significant differences in the relative proportions of NK, CD4 and CD8 populations were seen in BALF when compared to PB, except for a twofold increase in the percentage of activated CD8 cells in BALF. The only differences in BALF populations between the HIV-1+ groups were a lower percentage of CD4+ cells, and a higher percentage of activated CD8+ cells in the patients with pneumonitis. In the present cohort of patients there was little evidence for an overall lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HIV-1+ subjects. Changes observed in lymphocyte subsets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid populations reflected those in peripheral blood, and were similar for patients with and without pneumonitis. Evidence of increased CD8 subset activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did, however, emerge.

Lymphocyte subpopulations and their expression of activation, cytotoxic markers and memory status were characterized by triple immunofluorescence. Macrophages accounted for over 80% of the BAL cells. Only three out of 72 patients had a lymphocyte percentage >30%. No statistically significant differences in the relative proportions of NK, CD4 and CD8 populations were seen in BALF when compared to PB, except for a twofold increase in the percentage of activated CD8 cells in BALF. The only differences in BALF populations between the HIV-1+ groups were a lower percentage of CD4+ cells, and a higher percentage of activated CD8+ cells in the patients with pneumonitis. In the present cohort of patients there was little evidence for an overall lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HIV-1+ subjects. Changes observed in lymphocyte subsets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid populations reflected those in peripheral blood, and were similar for patients with and without pneumonitis. Evidence of increased CD8 subset activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did, however, emerge.
endoscopic ultrasonography	EUS	A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from a gastric submucosal tumor that was treated by a laparoscopic technique. Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a 2-cm submucosal tumor located in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body, showing a heterogeneous hyperechoic tumor. A laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach was performed. Pathological examinations revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle cells like fibroblasts and mature adipocytes. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the tumor was negative for desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of fibrolipoma was made. EUS is useful for differentiating a fibrolipoma from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor or lipoma by the findings of characteristic echogenesity and detection of the tumor origin.
hairy shaker disease	HSD	A survey by mail in 1979 of 995 sheep farmers in Victoria enquiring as to the occurrence of hairy shaker disease (HSD) in lambs on their farms resulted in a 48% response. A total of 17 farms reported the presence of HSD. One hundred and eleven ewes produced lambs with HSD representing a small proportion only of the ewes (0.8%) on these farms and an even smaller percentage of the total ewes (0.03%) in the survey. Abortions were not prevalent on the majority of farms reporting HSD. There was no evidence that HSD was more common in any particular area in Victoria. As was anticipated mucosal disease virus/bovine virus diarrhoea (MDV) antibody was often present in serums from affected sheep. It was concluded that at present, the hairy shaker form of border disease did not appear to be an economically important problem in Victoria.

Resting-state functional MRI	fMRI	Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) could be an advantageous choice for clinical applications by virtue of its clinical convenience and non-invasiveness. Without explicit stimulus, resting-state brain activity patterns cannot be obtained using any model-driven method. In this study, we advanced a measure named resting-state activity index (RSAI) to evaluate the resting-state brain activities. Using RSAI, we first investigated the resting-state brain activity patterns in normal adolescents to test the validity of this RSAI measure. Then we compared the resting-state brain activity patterns of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients to those of their matched controls. According to the resultant brain activity patterns, we suggest that RSAI could be an applicable measure to evaluate resting-state brain activities. As compared to the controls, the ADHD patients exhibited more significant resting-state activities in basic sensory and sensory-related cortices. This finding was in accordance with ADHD symptoms of inattention.

posterior chamber intraocular lens	PC IOL	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To discuss the options for management and review the authors' experience with dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens implants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed over a 3-year period of 12 consecutive patients with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implants dislocated into the vitreous cavity. The patients were managed with pars plana vitrectomy, repositioning or exchange, and transscleral suture fixation of the PC IOL. RESULTS: The visual acuity was 20/50 or better in 9 patients and the transscleral suture fixated PC IOL was in good position in 12 patients at the most recent follow-up. Perioperative complications included corneal edema, cystoid macular edema, retinal breaks and detachments, and suture erosion. CONCLUSION: Visual and anatomic outcomes were favorable.
basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor	BPTI	The effect of modification of basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) by derivatives of fatty acids (oleic, stearic) on the inhibition of bovine trypsin and human leukocyte elastase (HLE) was studied. Kinetic constants of interaction with trypsin and inhibition constants of both enzymes were determined. Hydrophobization of BPTI had virtually no effect on its high affinity for trypsin. The coupling of cis-unsaturated oleoyl radicals to the inhibitor molecule significantly increased the efficiency of HLE inhibition, whereas the coupling of saturated stearoyl radicals completely canceled the anti-elastase activity and in some cases promoted the substrate hydrolysis.

methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	MRSA	OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Singapore. METHODS: Prospectively collected surveillance data were reviewed during a 1-year period to determine the extent and origin of community-acquired MRSA infections. RESULTS: Whereas 32% of 383 MRSA infections were detected less than 48 hours after hospital admission and would, by convention, be classified as "community acquired," all but one of these were among patients who had been exposed to outpatient centers including dialysis or chemotherapy clinics, visiting nurses, community hospitals, or all three. CONCLUSIONS: With health care increasingly being delivered in an outpatient setting, community-acquired MRSA infections are often acquired in hospital-related sites and most may be more accurately described as "healthcare acquired." Infection control measures need to move beyond the traditional paradigm of acute care hospitals to effectively control the spread of resistant pathogens.
soluble complement receptor type 1	sCR1	BACKGROUND: The nonspecific immune response with activation of the complement system and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is important for the mediation of reperfusion injury after lung transplantation. In this study, we investigated the combined blockade of the complement system and leukocyte adhesion by a novel drug combining soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1, CD35) with the selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X (sLe(X), CD15s) synthesized to sCR1sLe(X). Both sCR1 and sCR1sLe(X) were supplied by AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc, Needham, Massachusetts. METHODS: Orthotopic allogeneic single left lung transplantation was performed in male rats (Brown Norway to Fischer F344; n = 5 in all groups) after a total ischemic time of 20 hours. Recipients received either no specific treatment (control) or administration of sCR1 (10 mg/kg) or sCR1sLe(X) (10 mg/kg) 15 minutes before reperfusion by intracardiac injection. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the native contralateral lung was occluded to assess gas exchange of the graft only. In additional animals (5 per group), lung tissue was frozen 24 hours after reperfusion and assessed for myeloperoxidase activity as a measurement of neutrophil migration into the graft and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances to quantify lipid peroxidation. RESULTS: Graft function as assessed by arterial PO (2) in recipients treated with sCR1sLeX was superior not only to that of controls (383 +/- 53 vs 56 +/- 7 mm Hg, P =. 000095) but also to that of animals treated with sCR1 (243 +/- 45 mm Hg, P =.031). This improvement was confirmed by significant reduction of neutrophil migration (0.33 +/- 0.05 vs control, 1.0 +/- 0.09 DeltaOD/mg/min, P =.0000024) and lipid peroxidation (6.2 +/- 0. 38 vs control, 10.6 +/- 0.54 pmol/g, P =.00021). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that combined inhibition of complement activation and leukocyte adhesion with sCR1sLe(X) reduces reperfusion injury significantly and that both mechanisms are effectively inhibited in this model.

transcriptional regulatory network	TRN	BACKGROUND: Cellular functions are coordinately carried out by groups of genes forming functional modules. Identifying such modules in the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of organisms is important for understanding the structure and function of these fundamental cellular networks and essential for the emerging modular biology. So far, the global connectivity structure of TRN has not been well studied and consequently not applied for the identification of functional modules. Moreover, network motifs such as feed forward loop are recently proposed to be basic building blocks of TRN. However, their relationship to functional modules is not clear. RESULTS: In this work we proposed a top-down approach to identify modules in the TRN of E. coli. By studying the global connectivity structure of the regulatory network, we first revealed a five-layer hierarchical structure in which all the regulatory relationships are downward. Based on this regulatory hierarchy, we developed a new method to decompose the regulatory network into functional modules and to identify global regulators governing multiple modules. As a result, 10 global regulators and 39 modules were identified and shown to have well defined functions. We then investigated the distribution and composition of the two basic network motifs (feed forward loop and bi-fan motif) in the hierarchical structure of TRN. We found that most of these network motifs include global regulators, indicating that these motifs are not basic building blocks of modules since modules should not contain global regulators. CONCLUSION: The transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli possesses a multi-layer hierarchical modular structure without feedback regulation at transcription level. This hierarchical structure builds the basis for a new and simple decomposition method which is suitable for the identification of functional modules and global regulators in the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli. Analysis of the distribution of feed forward loops and bi-fan motifs in the hierarchical structure suggests that these network motifs are not elementary building blocks of functional modules in the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli.
methoxychlor	MXC	The pesticide methoxychlor (MXC) is known to possess a weak estrogenic action and has been found to have a number of toxic effects on the rodent reproductive system, primarily at the gonadal level. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of MXC on the pituitary and hypothalamic components of the male reproductive system at dose levels that were without detectable testicular effects. At 21 days, male Long-Evans rats were gavaged daily with 25 or 50 mg/kg MXC in corn oil. Controls received vehicle only. After 8 weeks of dosing, no significant changes were seen in serum LH, FSH, or prolactin, nor in the pituitary concentrations of LH or FSH. Pituitary prolactin was elevated for both doses, and pituitary fragments perifused in vitro released more prolactin than did controls. The concentration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was higher in the mediobasal hypothalamus, but only for the 50-mg/kg group. At this dose, there was a corresponding increase in the KCl-stimulated release of GnRH. The data suggest that previously reported reproductive effects of MXC may be mediated, at least in part, through an elevation in prolactin concentration and release, which in turn is able to influence hypothalamic levels of GnRH. This prolactinemic effect may well represent an early component of the adverse action of MXC on the reproductive system.

Fanconi anemia	FA	Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease marked by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, and high incidence of leukemia and solid tumors. Eight genes have been cloned, with the accompanying protein products participating in at least two complexes, which appear to be functionally dependent upon one another. Previous studies have described chromatin localization of the FA core complex, except at mitosis, which is associated with phosphorylation of the FANCG protein (F. Qiao, A. Moss, and G. M. Kupfer, J. Biol. Chem. 276:23391-23396, 2001). The phosphorylation of FANCG at serine 7 by using mass spectrometry was previously mapped. The purpose of this study was to map the phosphorylation sites of FANCG at mitosis and to assess their functional importance. Reasoning that a potential kinase might be cdc2, which was previously reported to bind to FANCC, we showed that cdc2 chiefly phosphorylated a 14-kDa fragment of the C-terminal half of FANCG. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that this fragment contains amino acids 374 to 504. Kinase motif analysis demonstrated that three amino acids in this fragment were leading candidates for phosphorylation. By using PCR-directed in vitro mutagenesis we mutated S383, S387, and T487 to alanine. Mutation of S383 and S387 abolished the phosphorylation of FANCG at mitosis. These results were confirmed by use of phosphospecific antibodies directed against phosphoserine 383 and phosphoserine 387. Furthermore, the ability to correct FA-G mutant cells of human or hamster (where S383 and S387 are conserved) origin was also impaired by these mutations, demonstrating the functional importance of these amino acids. S387A mutant abolished FANCG fusion protein phosphorylation by cdc2. The FA pathway, of which FANCG is a part, is highly regulated by a series of phosphorylation steps that are important to its overall function.
