endoplasmic reticulum	ER	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of a reticulum underlying the plasma membrane (cortical ER) and ER associated with the nuclear envelope (nuclear ER). We used a Sec63p-green fluorescent protein fusion protein to study motility events associated with inheritance of cortical ER and nuclear ER in living yeast cells. During M phase before nuclear migration, we observed thick, apparently rigid tubular extensions emanating from the nuclear ER that elongate, undergo sweeping motions along the cell cortex, and shorten. Two findings support a role for microtubules in this process. First, extension of tubular structures from the nuclear ER is inhibited by destabilization of microtubules. Second, astral microtubules, structures that undergo similar patterns of extension, cortical surveillance and retraction, colocalize with nuclear ER extensions. During S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle, we observed anchorage of the cortical ER at the site of bud emergence and apical bud growth. Thin tubules of the ER that extend from the anchored cortical ER display undulating, apparently random movement and move into the bud as it grows. Finally, we found that cortical ER morphology is sensitive to a filamentous actin-destabilizing drug, latrunculin-A, and to mutations in the actin-encoding ACT1 gene. Our observations support 1) different mechanisms and cytoskeletal mediators for the inheritance of nuclear and cortical ER elements and 2) a mechanism for cortical ER inheritance that is cytoskeleton dependent but relies on anchorage, not directed movement.
protein-Interacting Protein	WIP	The Novel Adaptor Protein, Mti1p, and Vrp1p, a Homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein-Interacting Protein (WIP), May Antagonistically Regulate Type I Myosins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
myo3/5p	Myo5p	Type I myosins in yeast, Myo3p and Myo5p (Myo3/5p), are involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The SH3 domain of Myo5p regulates the polymerization of actin through interactions with both Las17p, a homolog of mammalian Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), and Vrp1p, a homolog of WASP-interacting protein (WIP). Vrp1p is required for both the localization of Myo5p to cortical patch-like structures and the ATP-independent interaction between the Myo5p tail region and actin filaments. We have identified and characterized a new adaptor protein, Mti1p (Myosin tail region-interacting protein), which interacts with the SH3 domains of Myo3/5p. Mti1p co-immunoprecipitated with Myo5p and Mti1p-GFP co-localized with cortical actin patches. A null mutation of MTI1 exhibited synthetic lethal phenotypes with mutations in SAC6 and SLA2, which encode actin-bundling and cortical actin-binding proteins, respectively. Although the mti1 null mutation alone did not display any obvious phenotype, it suppressed vrp1 mutation phenotypes, including temperature-sensitive growth, abnormally large cell morphology, defects in endocytosis and salt-sensitive growth. These results suggest that Mti1p and Vrp1p antagonistically regulate type I myosin functions.

cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase	dPGM	The structure of Escherichia coli cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM), complexed with the potent inhibitor vanadate, has been determined to a resolution of 1.30A (R-factor 0.159; R-free 0.213). The inhibitor is present in the active site, principally as divanadate, but with evidence of additional vanadate moieties at either end, and representing a different binding mode to that observed in the structural homologue prostatic acid phosphatase. The analysis reveals the enzyme-ligand interactions involved in inhibition of the mutase activity by vanadate and identifies a water molecule, observed in the native E.coli dPGM structure which, once activated by vanadate, may dephosphorylate the active protein. Rather than reflecting the active conformation previously observed for E.coli dPGM, the inhibited protein's conformation resembles that of the inactive dephosphorylated Saccharomyces cerevisiae dPGM. The provision of a high-resolution structure of both active and inactive forms of dPGM from a single organism, in conjunction with computational modelling of substrate molecules in the active site provides insight into the binding of substrates and the specific interactions necessary for three different activities, mutase, synthase and phosphatase, within a single active site. The sequence similarity of E.coli and human dPGMs allows us to correlate stucture with clinical pathology. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
anaphase-promoting complex	APC	The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is a multi-subunit E3 protein ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the metaphase to anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis. One of the subunits of the APC that is required for its ubiquitination activity is Doc1/Apc10, a protein composed of a Doc1 homology domain that has been identified in a number of diverse putative E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we present the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doc1/Apc10 at 2.2A resolution. The Doc1 homology domain forms a beta-sandwich structure that is related in architecture to the galactose-binding domain of galactose oxidase, the coagulation factor C2 domain and a domain of XRCC1. Residues that are invariant amongst Doc1/Apc10 sequences, including a temperature-sensitive mitotic arrest mutant, map to a beta-sheet region of the molecule, whose counterpart in galactose oxidase, the coagulation factor C2 domains and XRCC1, mediate bio-molecular interactions. This finding suggests the identification of the functionally important and conserved region of Doc1/Apc10 and, since invariant residues of Doc1/Apc10 colocalise with conserved residues of other Doc1 homology domains, we propose that the Doc1 homology domains perform common ubiquitination functions in the APC and other E3 ubiquitin ligases.

Ribonuclease P	RNase P	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease that cleaves precursor tRNAs to generate mature 5prime prime or minute termini. Although RNase P from all kingdoms of life have been found to have essential RNA subunits, the number and size of the protein subunits ranges from one small protein in bacteria to at least nine proteins of up to 100 kDa. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear RNase P, the enzyme is composed of ten subunits: a single RNA and nine essential proteins. The spatial organization of these components within the enzyme is not yet understood. In this study we examine the likely binary protein--protein and protein--RNA subunit interactions by using directed two- and three-hybrid tests in yeast. Only two protein subunits, Pop1p and Pop4p, specifically bind the RNA subunit. Pop4p also interacted with seven of the other eight protein subunits. The remaining protein subunits all showed one or more specific protein--protein interactions with the other integral protein subunits. Of particular interest was the behavior of Rpr2p, the only protein subunit found in RNase P but not in the closely related enzyme, RNase MRP. Rpr2p interacts strongly with itself as well as with Pop4p. Similar interactions with self and Pop4p were also detected for Snm1p, the only unique protein subunit so far identified in RNase MRP. This observation is consistent with Snm1p and Rpr2p serving analogous functions in the two enzymes. This study provides a low-resolution map of the multisubunit architecture of the ribonucleoprotein enzyme, nuclear RNase P from S. cerevisiae.
peptide residues	pT	Rad53, a yeast checkpoint protein involved in regulating the repair of DNA damage, contains two forkhead-associated domains, FHA1 and FHA2. Previous combinatorial library screening has shown that FHA1 strongly selects peptides containing a pTXXD motif. Subsequent location of this motif within the sequence of Rad9, the target protein, coupled with spectroscopic analysis has led to identification of a tight binding sequence that is likely the binding site of FHA1: (188)SLEV(pT)EADATFVQ(200). We present solution structures of FHA1 in complex with this pT-peptide and with another Rad9-derived pT-peptide that has ca 30-fold lower affinity, (148)KKMTFQ(pT)PTDPLE(160). Both complexes showed intermolecular NOEs predominantly between three peptide residues (pT, +1, and +2 residues) and five FHA1 residues (S82, R83, S85, T106, and N107). Furthermore, the following interactions were implicated on the basis of chemical shift perturbations and structural analysis: the phosphate group of the pT residue with the side-chain amide group of N86 and the guanidino group of R70, and the carboxylate group of Asp (at the +3 position) with the guanidino group of R83. The generated structures revealed a similar binding mode adopted by these two peptides, suggesting that pT and the +3 residue Asp are the major contributors to binding affinity and specificity, while +1 and +2 residues could provide additional fine-tuning. It was also shown that FHA1 does not bind to the corresponding pS-peptides or a related pY-peptide. We suggest that differentiation between pT and pS-peptides by FHA1 can be attributed to hydrophobic interactions between the methyl group of the pT residue and the aliphatic protons of R83, S85, and T106 from FHA1.

sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophor	SDS-PAGE	The catalytic subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1(C)) is encoded by the essential gene GLC7 and is involved in regulating diverse cellular processes. To identify potential regulatory or targeting subunits of yeast PP1(C), we tagged Glc7p at its amino terminus with protein A and affinity-purified Glc7p protein complexes from yeast. The purified proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. To confirm the accuracy of our identifications, peptides from some of the proteins were also sequenced using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Only four of the Glc7p-associated proteins that we identified (Mhp1p, Bni4p, Ref2p, and Sds22p) have previously been shown to interact with Glc7p, and multiple components of the CPF (cleavage and polyadenylation factor) complex involved in messenger RNA 3'-end processing were present as major components in the Glc7p-associated protein fraction. To confirm the interaction of Glc7p with this complex, we used the same approach to purify and characterize the components of the yeast CPF complex using protein A-tagged Pta1p. Six known components of the yeast (CPF) complex, together with Glc7p, were identified among the Pta1p-associated polypeptides using peptide mass fingerprint analysis. Thus Glc7p is a novel component of the CPF complex and may therefore be involved regulating mRNA 3'-end processing.

estrogen receptor alpha	ER alpha	A challenge in understanding the mechanism of protein function in biology is to establish the correlation between functional form in the intracellular environment and high-resolution structures obtained with in vitro techniques. Here we present a strategy to probe conformational changes of proteins inside cells. Our method involves: (i) engineering binding proteins to different conformations of a target protein, and (ii) using them to sense changes in the surface property of the target in cells. We probed ligand-induced conformational changes of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) ligand-binding domain (LBD). By using yeast two-hybrid techniques, we first performed combinatorial library screening of "monobodies" (small antibody mimics using the scaffold of a fibronectin type III domain) for clones that bind to ER alpha and then characterized their interactions with ER alpha in the nucleus, the native environment of ER alpha, in the presence of various ligands. A library using a highly flexible loop yielded monobodies that specifically recognize a particular ligand complex of ER alpha, and the pattern of monobody specificity was consistent with the structural differences found in known crystal structures of ER alpha-LBD. A more restrained loop library yielded clones that bind both agonist- and antagonist-bound ER alpha. Furthermore, we found that a deletion of the ER alpha F domain that is C-terminally adjacent to the LBD increased the crossreactivity of monobodies to the apo-ER alpha-LBD, suggesting a dynamic nature of the ER alpha-LBD conformation and a role of the F domain in restraining the LBD in an inactive conformation.

high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification	HMS-PCI	The recent abundance of genome sequence data has brought an urgent need for systematic proteomics to decipher the encoded protein networks that dictate cellular function. To date, generation of large-scale protein-protein interaction maps has relied on the yeast two-hybrid system, which detects binary interactions through activation of reporter gene expression. With the advent of ultrasensitive mass spectrometric protein identification methods, it is feasible to identify directly protein complexes on a proteome-wide scale. Here we report, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case, an example of this approach, which we term high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification (HMS-PCI). Beginning with 10% of predicted yeast proteins as baits, we detected 3,617 associated proteins covering 25% of the yeast proteome. Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in various signalling pathways and in the DNA damage response. Comparison of the HMS-PCI data set with interactions reported in the literature revealed an average threefold higher success rate in detection of known complexes compared with large-scale two-hybrid studies. Given the high degree of connectivity observed in this study, even partial HMS-PCI coverage of complex proteomes, including that of humans, should allow comprehensive identification of cellular networks.
tandem-affinity purification	TAP	Most cellular processes are carried out by multiprotein complexes. The identification and analysis of their components provides insight into how the ensemble of expressed proteins (proteome) is organized into functional units. We used tandem-affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry in a large-scale approach to characterize multiprotein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We processed 1,739 genes, including 1,143 human orthologues of relevance to human biology, and purified 589 protein assemblies. Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions. This higher-order map contains fundamental biological information and offers the context for a more reasoned and informed approach to drug discovery.
temperature-sensitive	Ts(-)	Sds22p is a conserved, leucine-rich repeat protein that interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1(C)) and which has been proposed to regulate one or more functions of PP1(C) during mitosis. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sds22p is a largely nuclear protein, most of which is present as a sTable 1:1 complex with yeast PP1(C) (Glc7p). Temperature-sensitive (Ts(-)) S. cerevisiae sds22 mutants show profound chromosome instability at elevated growth temperatures but do not confer a cell cycle stage-specific arrest. In the sds22-6 Ts(-) mutant, nuclear Glc7p is both reduced in level and aberrantly localized at 37 degrees C and the interaction between Glc7p and Sds22p in vitro is reduced at higher temperatures, consistent with the in vivo Ts(-) growth defect. Like some glc7 mutations, sds22-6 can suppress the Ts(-) growth defect associated with ipl1-2, a loss of function mutation in a protein kinase that is known to work in opposition to PP1 on at least two nuclear substrates. This, together with reciprocal genetic interactions between GLC7 and SDS22, suggests that Sds22p functions positively with Glc7p to promote dephosphorylation of nuclear substrates required for faithful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis, and this role is at least partly mediated by effects of Sds22p on the nuclear distribution of Glc7p
postmeiotic segregation	PMS	Sequence divergence reduces the frequency of recombination, a process that is dependent on the activity of the mismatch repair system. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, repair of mismatches results in gene conversion or restoration, whereas failure to repair mismatches results in postmeiotic segregation (PMS). By examining the conversion and PMS in yeast strains deficient in various MMR genes and heterozygous for large inserts (107 bp) with either a mixed sequence or a 39 (CA/TG) repetitive microsatellite sequence, we demonstrate that: (1) the inhibition of conversion by large inserts depends upon a complex containing both Msh2 and Pms1 proteins; (2) conversion is not inhibited if the single-stranded DNA loop in the heteroduplex is the microsatellite sequence; and (3) large heteroduplex loops with random sequence or repetitive sequence might be repaired by two complexes, containing either Msh2 or Pms1. Our results suggest that inhibition of recombination by heterologous inserts and large loop repair are not processed by the same MMR complexes. We propose that the inhibition of conversion by large inserts is due to recognition by the Msh2/Pms1 complex of mismatches created by intrastrand interactions in the heteroduplex loop.
last kinase	PKC	The nonessential RGD1 gene encodes a Rho-GTPase activating protein for the Rho3 and Rho4 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies have revealed genetic interactions between RGD1 and the SLG1 and MID2 genes, encoding two putative sensors for cell integrity signaling, and VRP1 encoding an actin and myosin interacting protein involved in polarized growth. To better understand the role of Rgd1p, we isolated multicopy suppressor genes of the cell lethality of the double mutant rgd1Delta mid2Delta. RHO1 and RHO2 encoding two small GTPases, MKK1 encoding one of the MAP-kinase kinases in the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, and MTL1, a MID2-homolog, were shown to suppress the rgd1Delta defects strengthening the functional links between RGD1 and the cell integrity pathway. Study of the transcriptional activity of Rlm1p, which is under the control of Mpk1p, the last kinase of the PKC pathway, and follow-up of the PST1 transcription, which is positively regulated by Rlm1p, indicate that the lack of RGD1 function diminishes the PKC pathway activity. We hypothesize that the rgd1Delta inactivation, at least through the hyperactivation of the small GTPases Rho3p and Rho4p, alters the secretory pathway and/or the actin cytoskeleton and decreases activity of the PKC pathway.
bovine trabecular meshwork	TM	PURPOSE: To identify factors that interact in vivo with myocilin, a glaucoma gene product. METHODS: The yeast two-hybrid system with myocilin as the bait and a human skeletal muscle cDNA library as the prey was used to identify potential factors that interact with myocilin. Interactions were also examined in bovine trabecular meshwork (TM) cells through a mammalian two-hybrid system. Biochemical coimmunoprecipitation from both human TM cell lysate and in vitro translated proteins was also used to confirm results obtained from yeast analysis. RESULTS: Twenty positive clones isolated through yeast two-hybrid screening were deemed potential myocilin partners. Sequence analysis determined that two of them encoded for myocilin from amino acids 64 to 268. Myocilin was also found to interact with a component of the myosin motor protein, myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). The myocilin-myocilin and myocilin-RLC interactions revealed by the yeast system were further confirmed and demonstrated in cultured TM cells, by means of a mammalian two-hybrid system, and through biochemical coimmunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence, and immunogold double labeling. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that myocilin can form homomultimers in vivo, independent of the olfactomedin-like domain. Further analysis established that the leucine zipper motif of myocilin may be necessary for the myocilin-RLC interaction. The interaction of myocilin with RLC, a component of the myosin motor protein complex, implies a role for myocilin in the actomyosin system, linking in turn this novel protein to functional status of the TM.

Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor	RhoGDI	The Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) regulates the activation-inactivation cycle of Rho small GTPases, such as Cdc42 and RhoA, by extracting them from the membrane. To study the roles of Mg(2+), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), ionic strength and phosphorylation on the interactions of RhoGDI with Cdc42 and RhoA, we developed a new, efficient and reliable method to produce prenylated Rho proteins using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been previously reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-treatment of isolated membranes increased RhoA extraction from membranes by RhoGDI [Lang, Gesbert, Delespine-Carmagnat, Stancou, Pouchelet and Bertoglio (1996) EMBO J. 16, 510-519]. In the present study, we used an in vitro affinity chromatography system to show that phosphorylation of RhoA and Cdc42 significantly increased their interaction with RhoGDI under physiological conditions of ionic strength. This increase was independent of the nucleotide (GDP or guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) loaded on to the Rho proteins, as well as of Mg(2+) and PIP(2). Moreover, dephosphorylation of rat brain membranes by alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased the extraction of RhoA and Cdc42 by RhoGDI. Subsequent re-phosphorylation by PKA restored the extraction levels, indicating the reversibility of this process. These results clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylation states of Cdc42 and RhoA regulate their interactions with RhoGDI and, consequently, their extraction from rat brain membranes. We therefore suggest that phosphorylation is a mechanism of regulation of Cdc42 and RhoA activity that is independent of GDP-GTP cycling.

antitumor agent camptothecin	CPT	DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) catalyzes topological changes in DNA and is the cellular target of the antitumor agent camptothecin (CPT). Non-CPT drugs that target Top1p, such as indolocarbazoles, are under clinical development. However, whether the cytotoxicity of indolocarbazoles derives from Top1p poisoning remains unclear. To further investigate indolocarbazole mechanism, rebeccamycin R-3 activity was examined in vitro and in yeast. Using a series of Top1p mutants, where substitution of residues around the active site tyrosine has well-defined effects on enzyme catalysis, we show that catalytically active, CPT-resistant enzymes remain sensitive to R-3. This indolocarbazole did not inhibit yeast Top1p activity, yet was effective in stabilizing Top1p-DNA complexes. Similar results were obtained with human Top1p, when Ser or His were substituted for Asn-722. The mutations altered enzyme function and sensitivity to CPT, yet R-3 poisoning of Top1p was unaffected. Moreover, top1delta, rad52delta yeast cells expressing human Top1p, but not catalytically inactive Top1Y723Fp, were sensitive to R-3. These data support hTop1p as the cellular target of R-3 and indicate that distinct drug-enzyme interactions at the active site are required for efficient poisoning by R-3 or CPT. Furthermore, resistance to one poison may potentiate cell sensitivity to structurally distinct compounds that also target Top1p.
molecular chaperone's heat-shock protein	Hsp	Direct interactions between molecular chaperones heat-shock protein (Hsp) 70 and Hsp40: yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 binds the extreme C-terminal region of yeast Hsp40 Sis1.
heat-shock protein 40	Hsp40	Heat-shock protein 40 (Hsp40) enables Hsp70 to play critical roles in a number of cellular processes, such as protein folding, assembly, degradation and translocation in vivo. Hsp40 recognizes and binds non-native polypeptides and delivers them to Hsp70. Then Hsp40 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 to fold the polypeptides. By using yeast Hsp40 Sis1 and yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 as our model proteins, we found that the Sis1 peptide-binding fragment interacts directly with the full-length Ssa1 in vitro. Further studies showed that the C-terminal lid domain of Ssa1 could interact with Sis1 peptide-binding domain physically in vitro. The Sis1 peptide-binding fragment forms a stable complex with the Ssa1 C-terminal lid domain in solution. The interactions between these two proteins appear to be charge-charge interactions because high-ionic-strength buffer can dissociate the complex. Further mapping studies showed that the Sis1 peptide-binding fragment binds the extreme C-terminal 15 amino acid residues of Ssa1. A flexible glycine-rich region is followed by these 15 residues in the Ssa1 primary sequence. Atomic force microscopy of the Sis1-Ssa1 complex showed that only one end of the Ssa1 lid domain binds the Sis1 peptide-binding-fragment dimer at the upper level of the huge groove within the Sis1 dimer. Based on the data, we propose an "anchoring and docking" model to illustrate the mechanisms by which Hsp40 interacts with Hsp70 and delivers the non-native polypeptide to Hsp70.
Nitric oxide	NO	Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to inhibit the copper-responsive yeast transcription factor Ace1 in an oxygen-dependent manner. However, the mechanism responsible for NO-dependent inhibition of Ace1 remains unestablished. In the present study, the chemical interaction of nitrogen oxide species with Ace1 was examined using a yeast reporter system. Exposure of yeast to various nitrogen oxides, under a variety of conditions, revealed that the oxygen-dependent inhibition of Ace1 is due to the reaction of NO with O(2). The nitrosating nitrogen oxide species N(2)O(3) is likely to be the disrupter of Ace1 activity. Considering the similarity of metal-thiolate ligation in Ace1 with other mammalian metalloproteins such as metallothionein, metal chaperones, and zinc-finger proteins, these results help to understand the biochemical interactions of NO with those mammalian metalloproteins.
synthetic genetic array	SGA	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 80% of the approximately 6200 predicted genes are nonessential, implying that the genome is buffered from the phenotypic consequences of genetic perturbation. To evaluate function, we developed a method for systematic construction of double mutants, termed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, in which a query mutation is crossed to an array of approximately 4700 deletion mutants. Inviable double-mutant meiotic progeny identify functional relationships between genes. SGA analysis of genes with roles in cytoskeletal organization (BNI1, ARP2, ARC40, BIM1), DNA synthesis and repair (SGS1, RAD27), or uncharacterized functions (BBC1, NBP2) generated a network of 291 interactions among 204 genes. Systematic application of this approach should produce a global map of gene function.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein	WASP	Peptide recognition modules mediate many protein-protein interactions critical for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Complete genome sequences have revealed thousands of these domains, requiring improved methods for identifying their physiologically relevant binding partners. We have developed a strategy combining computational prediction of interactions from phage-display ligand consensus sequences with large-scale two-hybrid physical interaction tests. Application to yeast SH3 domains generated a phage-display network containing 394 interactions among 206 proteins and a two-hybrid network containing 233 interactions among 145 proteins. Graph theoretic analysis identified 59 highly likely interactions common to both networks. Las17 (Bee1), a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) family of actin-assembly proteins, showed multiple SH3 interactions, many of which were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation.
regulatory particle	RP	The 26S proteasome plays a major role in eukaryotic protein breakdown, especially for ubiquitin-tagged proteins. Substrate specificity is conferred by the regulatory particle (RP), which can dissociate into stable lid and base subcomplexes. To help define the molecular organization of the RP, we tested all possible paired interactions among subunits from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Within the base, a Rpt4/5/3/6 interaction cluster was evident. Within the lid, a structural cluster formed around Rpn5/11/9/8. Interactions were detected among synonymous subunits (Csn4/5/7/6) from the evolutionarily related COP9 signalosome (CSN) from Arabidopsis, implying a similar quaternary arrangement. No paired interactions were detected between lid, base or core particle subcomplexes, suggesting that stable contacts between them require prior assembly. Mutational analysis defined the ATPase, coiled-coil, PCI and MPN domains as important for RP assembly. A single residue in the vWA domain of Rpn10 is essential for amino acid analog resistance, for degrading a ubiquitin fusion degradation substrate and for stabilizing lid-base association. Comprehensive subunit interaction maps for the 26S proteasome and CSN support the ancestral relationship of these two complexes.

methyl methanesulfonate	MMS	To study the role of Rad50 in the DNA damage response, we cloned and deleted the Schizosaccharomyces pombe RAD50 homologue. The deletion is sensitive to a range of DNA-damaging agents and shows dynamic epistatic interactions with other recombination-repair genes. We show that Rad50 is necessary for recombinational repair of the DNA lesion at the mating-type locus and that rad50Delta shows slow DNA replication. We also find that Rad50 is not required for slowing down S phase in response to hydroxy urea or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. Interestingly, in rad50Delta cells, the recombination frequency between two homologous chromosomes is increased at the expense of sister chromatid recombination. We propose that Rad50, an SMC-like protein, promotes the use of the sister chromatid as the template for homologous recombinational repair. In support of this, we found that Rad50 functions in the same pathway for the repair of MMS-induced damage as Rad21, the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Scc1 cohesin protein. We speculate that Rad50 interacts with the cohesin complex during S phase to assist repair and possibly re-initiation of replication after replication fork collapse.
inner centromere protein	INCENP	Functional cooperation of Dam1, Ipl1, and the inner centromere protein (INCENP)-related protein Sli15 during chromosome segregation.
metazoan inner centromere protein	INCENP	We have shown previously that Ipl1 and Sli15 are required for chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sli15 associates directly with the Ipl1 protein kinase and these two proteins colocalize to the mitotic spindle. We show here that Sli15 stimulates the in vitro, and likely in vivo, kinase activity of Ipl1, and Sli15 facilitates the association of Ipl1 with the mitotic spindle. The Ipl1-binding and -stimulating activities of Sli15 both reside within a region containing homology to the metazoan inner centromere protein (INCENP). Ipl1 and Sli15 also bind to Dam1, a microtubule-binding protein required for mitotic spindle integrity and kinetochore function. Sli15 and Dam1 are most likely physiological targets of Ipl1 since Ipl1 can phosphorylate both proteins efficiently in vitro, and the in vivo phosphorylation of both proteins is reduced in ipl1 mutants. Some dam1 mutations exacerbate the phenotype of ipl1 and sli15 mutants, thus providing evidence that Dam1 interactions with Ipl1-Sli15 are functionally important in vivo. Similar to Dam1, Ipl1 and Sli15 each bind to microtubules directly in vitro, and they are associated with yeast centromeric DNA in vivo. Given their dual association with microtubules and kinetochores, Ipl1, Sli15, and Dam1 may play crucial roles in regulating chromosome-spindle interactions or in the movement of kinetochores along microtubules.
general transcription factor	GTF	TFIIB is an RNA polymerase II general transcription factor (GTF) that has also been implicated in the mechanism of action of certain promoter-specific activators (see, for examples, [1-11]). TFIIB enters the preinitiation complex (PIC) primarily through contact with the TATA box binding protein (TBP), an interaction mediated by three TBP residues [12-14]. To study the role of TFIIB in transcription activation in vivo, we randomly mutagenized these three residues in yeast TBP and screened for promoter-specific activation mutants. One mutant bearing a single conservative substitution, TBP-E186D, is the focus of this study. As expected, TBP-E186D binds normally to the TATA box but fails to support the entry of TFIIB into the PIC. Cells expressing TBP-E186D are viable but have a severe slow-growth phenotype. Whole-genome expression analysis indicates that transcription of 17% of yeast genes are compromised by this mutation. Chimeric promoter analysis indicates that the region of the gene that confers sensitivity to the TBP-E186D mutation is the UAS (upstream activating sequence), which contains the activator binding sites. Most interestingly, other TBP mutants that interfere with different interactions (TFIIB, TFIIA, or the TATA box) and a TFIIB mutant defective for interaction with TBP all manifest distinct and selective promoter-specific activation defects. Our results implicate the entry of TFIIB into the PIC as a critical step in the activation of certain promoters and reveal diverse mechanisms of transcription activation.

three-amino acid loop extension	TALE	Interactions between TALE (three-amino acid loop extension) homeodomain proteins play important roles in the development of both fungi and animals. Although in plants, two different subclasses of TALE proteins include important developmental regulators, the existence of interactions between plant TALE proteins has remained unexplored. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate that the Arabidopsis BELL1 (BEL1) homeodomain protein can selectively heterodimerize with specific KNAT homeodomain proteins. Interaction is mediated by BEL1 sequences N terminal to the homeodomain and KNAT sequences including the MEINOX domain. These findings validate the hypothesis that the MEINOX domain has been conserved between plants and animals as an interaction domain for developmental regulators. In yeast, BEL1 and KNAT proteins can activate transcription only as a heterodimeric complex, suggesting a role for such complexes in planta. Finally, overlapping patterns of BEL1 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) expression within the inflorescence meristem suggest a role for the BEL1-STM complex in maintaining the indeterminacy of the inflorescence meristem.

actin-regulating Ser/Thr kinase	ARK	The yeast actin-regulating kinases Ark1p and Prk1p are signaling proteins localized to cortical actin patches, which may be sites of endocytosis. Interactions between the endocytic proteins Pan1p and End3p may be regulated by Prk1p-dependent threonine phosphorylation of Pan1p within the consensus sequence [L/I]xxQxTG. We identified two Prk1p phosphorylation sites within the Pan1p-binding protein Ent1p, a yeast epsin homologue, and demonstrate Prk1p-dependent phosphorylation of both threonines. Converting both threonines to either glutamate or alanine mimics constitutively phosphorylated or dephosphorylated Ent1p, respectively. Synthetic growth defects were observed in a pan1-20 ENT1(EE) double mutant, suggesting that Ent1p phosphorylation negatively regulates the formation/activity of a Pan1p-Ent1p complex. Interestingly, pan1-20 ent2 Delta but not pan1-20 ent1 Delta double mutants had improved growth and endocytosis over the pan1-20 mutant. We found that actin-regulating Ser/Thr kinase (ARK) mutants exhibit endocytic defects and that overexpressing either wild-type or alanine-substituted Ent1p partially suppressed phenotypes associated with loss of ARK kinases, including growth, endocytosis, and actin localization defects. Consistent with synthetic growth defects of pan1-20 ENT1(EE) cells, overexpressing glutamate-substituted Ent1p was deleterious to ARK mutants. Surprisingly, overexpressing the related Ent2p protein could not suppress ARK kinase mutant phenotypes. These results suggest that Ent1p and Ent2p are not completely redundant and may perform opposing functions in endocytosis. These data support the model that, as for clathrin-dependent recycling of synaptic vesicles, yeast endocytic protein phosphorylation inhibits endocytic functions.
carboxypeptidase Y	CPY	The GGAs (Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins) are a family of multidomain adaptor proteins involved in protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network of eukaryotic cells. Here we present results from a functional characterization of the two Saccharomyces cerevisiae GGAs, Gga1p and Gga2p. We show that deletion of both GGA genes causes defects in sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and proteinase A to the vacuole, vacuolar morphology, and maturation of alpha-factor. A structure-function analysis reveals a requirement of the VHS, GAT, and hinge for function, while the GAE domain is less important. We identify putative clathrin-binding motifs in the hinge domain of both yeast GGAs. These motifs are shown to mediate clathrin binding in vitro. While mutation of these motifs alone does not block function of the GGAs in vivo, combining these mutations with truncations of the hinge and GAE domains diminishes function, suggesting functional cooperation between different clathrin-binding elements. Thus, these observations demonstrate that the yeast GGAs play important roles in the CPY pathway, vacuole biogenesis, and alpha-factor maturation and identify structural determinants that are critical for these functions.
human immunodeficiency virus type 1	HIV-1	Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA in the nuclear genome is catalyzed by the retroviral integrase (IN). In addition to IN, viral and cellular proteins associated in the high-molecular-weight preintegration complex have been suggested to be involved in this process. In an attempt to define host factors interacting with IN, we used an in vitro system to identify cellular proteins in interaction with HIV-1 IN. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen since (i) its complete sequence has been established and the primary structure of all the putative proteins from this eucaryote has been deduced, (ii) there is a significant degree of homology between human and yeast proteins, and (iii) we have previously shown that the expression of HIV-1 IN in yeast induces a lethal phenotype. Strong evidences suggest that this lethality is linked to IN activity in infected human cells where integration requires the cleavage of genomic DNA. Using IN-affinity chromatography we identified four yeast proteins interacting with HIV-1 IN, including the yeast chaperonin yHSP60, which is the counterpart of human hHSP60. Yeast lethality induced by HIV-1 IN was abolished when a mutated HSP60 was coexpressed, therefore suggesting that both proteins interact in vivo. Besides interacting with HIV-1 IN, the hHSP60 was able to stimulate the in vitro processing and joining activities of IN and protected this enzyme from thermal denaturation. In addition, the functional human HSP60-HSP10 complex in the presence of ATP was able to recognize the HIV-1 IN as a substrate.

Yeast pyruvate kinase	YPK	Yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) is regulated by intermediates of the glycolytic pathway [e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and citrate] and by the ATP charge of the cell. Recent kinetic and thermodynamic data with Mn(2+)-activated YPK show that Mn(2+) mediates the allosteric communication between the substrate, PEP, and the allosteric effector, FBP [Mesecar, A., and Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6792, 6803]. These results indicate that divalent cations modulate multiligand interactions, and hence cooperativity with YPK. The nature of multiligand interactions on YPK was investigated in the presence of the physiological divalent activator Mg(2+). The binding interactions of PEP, Mg(2+), and FBP were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding data were subject to thermodynamic linked-function analysis to determine the magnitudes of the multiligand interactions governing the allosteric activation of YPK. The two ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mg(2+), PEP and FBP, and FBP and Mg(2+) are 0.88, -0.38, and -0.75 kcal/mol, respectively. The two-ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mn(2+) and FBP and Mn(2+) are more negative than those with Mg(2+) as the cation. This indicates that the interactions between the divalent cation and PEP with YPK are different for Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) and that the interaction is not simply electrostatic in nature, as originally hypothesized. The magnitude of the heterotropic interaction between the metal and FBP is similar with Mg(2+) and Mn(2+). The simultaneous binding of Mg(2+), PEP, and FBP to YPK is favored by 3.21 kcal/mol compared to independent binding. This complex is destabilized by 3.30 kcal/mol relative to the analogous YPK-Mn(2+)-PEP-FDP complex. Interpretation of K(d) values when cooperative binding occurs must be done with care as these are not simple thermodynamic constants. These data demonstrate that the divalent metal, which activates phosphoryl transfer in YPK, plays a key role in modulating the various multiligand interactions that define the overall allosteric properties of the enzyme.

his46Cys	H46C	Preparation and characterization of two new site-directed mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, i.e., His46Cys (H46C) and His120Cys (H120C), in which individual histidyl ligands in the copper-binding site were replaced by cysteine, are reported here. These two mutant CuZnSOD proteins may be described as type 2 (or normal) rather than type 1 (or blue) copper-cysteinate proteins and are characterized by their yellow rather than blue color, resulting from intense copper-to-sulfur charge transfer bands around 400 nm, their type 2 EPR spectra, with large rather than small nuclear hyperfine interactions, and their characteristic type 2 d-d electronic absorption spectra. An interesting difference between these two copper site His-to-Cys mutations is that the imidazolate bridge between the two metal sites that is characteristic of the wild-type protein remains intact in the case of the H46C mutant but is not present in the case of the H120C mutant.

An interesting difference between these two copper site His-to-Cys mutations is that the imidazolate bridge between the two metal sites that is characteristic of the wild-type protein remains intact in the case of the H46C mutant but is not present in the case of the H120C mutant.
transcription elongation factors	CTD	Genetic and biochemical studies have identified many factors thought to be important for transcription elongation. We investigated relationships between three classes of these factors: (1) transcription elongation factors Spt4-Spt5, TFIIS, and Spt16; (2) the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; and (3) protein kinases that phosphorylate the CTD and a phosphatase that dephosphorylates it. We observe that spt4 and spt5 mutations cause strong synthetic phenotypes in combination with mutations that shorten or alter the composition of the CTD; affect the Kin28, Bur1, or Ctk1 CTD kinases; and affect the CTD phosphatase Fcp1. We show that Spt5 co-immunoprecipitates with RNA polymerase II that has either a hyper- or a hypophosphorylated CTD. Furthermore, mutation of the CTD or of CTD modifying enzymes does not affect the ability of Spt5 to bind RNA polymerase II. We find a similar set of genetic interactions between the CTD, CTD modifying enzymes, and TFIIS. In contrast, an spt16 mutation did not show these interactions. These results suggest that the CTD plays a key role in modulating elongation in vivo and that at least a subset of elongation factors are dependent upon the CTD for their normal function.
haloacid dehalogenase	HAD	MDP-1 is a eukaryotic magnesium-dependent acid phosphatase with little sequence homology to previously characterized phosphatases. The presence of a conserved motif (Asp-X-Asp-X-Thr) in the N terminus of MDP-1 suggested a relationship to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which contains a number of magnesium-dependent acid phosphatases. These phosphatases utilize an aspartate nucleophile and contain a number of conserved active-site residues and hydrophobic patches, which can be plausibly aligned with conserved residues in MDP-1. Seven site-specific point mutants of MDP-1 were produced by modifying the catalytic aspartate, serine, and lysine residues to asparagine or glutamate, alanine, and arginine, respectively. The activity of these mutants confirms the assignment of MDP-1 as a member of the HAD superfamily. Detailed comparison of the sequence of the 15 MDP-1 sequences from various organisms with other HAD superfamily sequences suggests that MDP-1 is not closely related to any particular member of the superfamily. The crystal structures of several HAD family enzymes identify a domain proximal to the active site responsible for important interactions with low molecular weight substrates. The absence of this domain or any other that might perform the same function in MDP-1 suggests an "open" active site capable of interactions with large substrates such as proteins. This suggestion was experimentally confirmed by demonstration that MDP-1 is competent to catalyze the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.
steroid receptor-binding protein	RGS	Steroid hormone receptors are composed of six major functional domains, i.e. the A/B domains as the activation function 1 domain (AF-1), domain C as the DNA-binding domain, domain D as a hinge domain and domain E/F as the ligand-dependent transcriptional domain (AF-2). They regulate gene transcription through interactions with various nuclear factors of their domains, such as AF-1 and AF-2. We have insufficient knowledge of the function of the DNA-binding domain (domain C) except for its DNA-binding function or the hinge domain (domain D). Therefore, we attempted to identify factors interacting with the domains by using a yeast two-hybrid system. Domains C and D of estrogen receptor alpha were used as a bait to isolate cDNA clones from a rat ovary cDNA library. We isolated the cDNA clone of a novel steroid receptor-binding protein bearing the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) designated as SRB-RGS. The protein repressed the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor alpha, suggesting cross-talk of steroid hormones and peptide hormones (or growth factors) for signal transductions mediated by SRB-RGS.
ubiquitin	Ub	BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are central enzymes involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. During this process, ubiquitin (Ub) and the E2 protein form an unstable E2-Ub thiolester intermediate prior to the transfer of ubiquitin to an E3-ligase protein and the labeling of a substrate for degradation. A series of complex interactions occur among the target substrate, ubiquitin, E2, and E3 in order to efficiently facilitate the transfer of the ubiquitin molecule. However, due to the inherent instability of the E2-Ub thiolester, the structural details of this complex intermediate are not known. RESULTS: A three-dimensional model of the E2-Ub thiolester intermediate has been determined for the catalytic domain of the E2 protein Ubc1 (Ubc1(Delta450)) and ubiquitin from S. cerevisiae. The interface of the E2-Ub intermediate was determined by kinetically monitoring thiolester formation by 1H-(15)N HSQC spectra by using combinations of 15N-labeled and unlabeled Ubc1(Delta450) and Ub proteins. By using the surface interface as a guide and the X-ray structures of Ub and the 1.9 A structure of Ubc1(Delta450) determined here, docking simulations followed by energy minimization were used to produce the first model of a E2-Ub thiolester intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary surfaces were found on the E2 and Ub proteins whereby the C terminus of Ub wraps around the E2 protein terminating in the thiolester between C88 (Ubc1(Delta450)) and G76 (Ub). The model supports in vivo and in vitro experiments of E2 derivatives carrying surface residue substitutions. Furthermore, the model provides insights into the arrangement of Ub, E2, and E3 within a ternary targeting complex.

Cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase	PNGase	Cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) is a de-N-glycosylating enzyme which may be involved in the proteasome-dependent pathway for degradation of misfolded glycoproteins formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are exported into the cytoplasm. A cytoplasmic PNGase found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Png1p, is widely distributed in higher eukaryotes as well as in yeast (Suzuki, T., et al. J. Cell Biol. 149, 1039-1051, 2000). The recently uncovered complete genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana prompted us to search for the protein homologue of Png1p in this organism. Interestingly, when the mouse Png1p homologue sequence was used as a query, not only a Png1p homologue containing a transglutaminase-like domain that is believed to contain a catalytic triad for PNGase activity, but also four proteins which had a domain of 46 amino acids in length that exhibited significant similarity to the N-terminus of mouse Png1p were identified. Moreover, three of these homologous proteins were also found to possess a UBA or UBX domain, which are found in various proteins involved in the ubiquitin-related pathway. We name this newly found homologous region the PUB (Peptide:N-glycanase/UBA or UBX-containing proteins) domain and propose that this domain may mediate protein-protein interactions.

histone acetyltransferase	HAT	GCN5 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and required for transcription of specific genes within chromatin as part of the SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetylase) coactivator complex. Mammalian cells have two distinct GCN5 homologs (PCAF and GCN5L) that have been found in three different SAGA-like complexes (PCAF complex, TFTC [TATA-binding-protein-free TAF(II)-containing complex], and STAGA [SPT3-TAF(II)31-GCN5L acetylase]). The composition and roles of these mammalian HAT complexes are still poorly characterized. Here, we present the purification and characterization of the human STAGA complex. We show that STAGA contains homologs of most yeast SAGA components, including two novel human proteins with histone-like folds and sequence relationships to yeast SPT7 and ADA1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STAGA has acetyl coenzyme A-dependent transcriptional coactivator functions from a chromatin-assembled template in vitro and associates in HeLa cells with spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and DDB1, two structurally related proteins. SAP130 is a component of the splicing factor SF3b that associates with U2 snRNP and is recruited to prespliceosomal complexes. DDB1 (p127) is a UV-damaged-DNA-binding protein that is involved, as part of a complex with DDB2 (p48), in nucleotide excision repair and the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Our results thus suggest cellular roles of STAGA in chromatin modification, transcription, and transcription-coupled processes through direct physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription activators and with components of the splicing and DNA repair machineries.

double-strand break	DSB	Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rhp55 and Rhp57 are RecA-like proteins involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. Here we demonstrate that Rhp55 and Rhp57 proteins strongly interact in vivo, similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad55p and Rad57p. Mutations in the conserved ATP-binding/hydrolysis folds of both the Rhp55 and Rhp57 proteins impaired their function in DNA repair but not in cell proliferation. However, when combined, ATPase fold mutations in Rhp55p and Rhp57p resulted in severe defects of both functions, characteristic of the deletion mutants. Yeast two-hybrid analysis also revealed other multiple in vivo interactions among S. pombe proteins involved in recombinational DNA repair. Similar to S. cerevisiae Rad51p-Rad54p, S. pombe Rhp51p and Rhp54p were found to interact. Both putative Rad52 homologs in S. pombe, Rad22p and Rti1p, were found to interact with the C-terminal region of Rhp51 protein. Moreover, Rad22p and Rti1p exhibited mutual, as well as self-, interactions. In contrast to the S. cerevisiae interacting pair Rad51p-Rad55p, S. pombe Rhp51 protein strongly interacted with Rhp57 but not with Rhp55 protein. In addition, the Rti1 and Rad22 proteins were found to form a complex with the large subunit of S. pombe RPA. Our data provide compelling evidence that most, but not all, of the protein-protein interactions found in S. cerevisiae DSB repair are evolutionarily conserved.
viral ribonucleoprotein	RNP	Lyssaviruses, the causative agents of rabies encephalitis, are distributed in seven genotypes. The phylogenetically distant rabies virus (PV strain, genotype 1) and Mokola virus (genotype 3) were used to develop a strategy to identify functional homologous interactive domains from two proteins (P and N) which participate in the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transcription-replication complex. This strategy combined two-hybrid and green fluorescent protein-reverse two-hybrid assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze protein-protein interactions and a reverse genetic assay in mammalian cells to study the transcriptional activity of the reconstituted RNP complex. Lyssavirus P proteins contain two N-binding domains (N-BDs), a strong one encompassing amino acid (aa) 176 to the C terminus and a weak one in the 189 N-terminal aa. The N-terminal portion of P (aa 52 to 189) also contains a homomultimerization site. Here we demonstrate that N-P interactions, although weaker, are maintained between proteins of the different genotypes. A minimal transcriptional module of the P protein was obtained by fusing the first 60 N-terminal aa containing the L protein binding site to the C-terminal strong N-BD. Random mutation of the strong N-BD on P protein identified three highly conserved K residues crucial for N-P interaction. Their mutagenesis in full-length P induced a transcriptionally defective RNP. The analysis of homologous interactive domains presented here and previously reported dissections of the P protein allowed us to propose a model of the functional interaction network of the lyssavirus P protein. This model underscores the central role of P at the interface between L protein and N-RNA template.

RNA polymerase II	pol II	The Mediator complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for diverse aspects of transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Mediator is composed of two functionally distinct subcomplexes, Rgr1 and Srb4. To identify the structures and functions of each subcomplex, we expressed recombinant proteins for each subunit and assayed their interactions with each other and with basal transcription proteins. The Rgr1 subcomplex is composed of the Gal11 module, which binds activators, and the Med9/10 module. The Med9/10 module is required for both transcriptional activation and repression, and these activities appear to be carried out by two submodules. Proteins in the Med9 submodule interact physically and genetically with Srb10/11, suggesting that the Med9 submodule mediates the repression of pol II. Purified recombinant Srb4 subcomplex stimulated basal transcription of pol II but had little effect on activated transcription and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the Rpb1 subunit of pol II. Both subcomplexes of Mediator interacted with a distinct set of basal transcription factors and pol II. The modular organization of Mediator and the associated functions suggest that the Mediator complex may recruit and/or stabilize the preinitiation complex through several points of contact with transcriptional regulators and basal transcription factors.
GTPase effector domain	GED	Dnm1p belongs to a family of dynamin-related GTPases required to remodel different cellular membranes. In budding yeast, Dnm1p-containing complexes assemble on the cytoplasmic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane at sites where mitochondrial tubules divide. Our previous genetic studies suggested that Dnm1p's GTPase activity was required for mitochondrial fission and that Dnm1p interacted with itself. In this study, we show that bacterially expressed Dnm1p can bind and hydrolyze GTP in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation studies and yeast two-hybrid analysis suggest that Dnm1p oligomerizes in vivo. With the use of the yeast two-hybrid system, we show that this Dnm1p oligomerization is mediated, in part, by a C-terminal sequence related to the GTPase effector domain (GED) in dynamin. The Dnm1p interactions characterized here are similar to those reported for dynamin and dynamin-related proteins that form higher order structures in vivo, suggesting that Dnm1p assembles to form rings or collars that surround mitochondrial tubules. Based on previous findings, a K705A mutation in the Dnm1p GED is predicted to interfere with GTP hydrolysis, stabilize active Dnm1p-GTP, and stimulate a rate-limiting step in fission. Here we show that expression of the Dnm1 K705A protein in yeast enhances mitochondrial fission. Our results provide evidence that the GED region of a dynamin-related protein modulates a rate-limiting step in membrane fission.
hexafluoroisopropanol	HFIP	The conformational transitions of bovine beta-lactoglobulin A and phosphoglycerate kinase from yeast induced by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroethanol (TFE) have been studied by dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy in order to elucidate the potential of fluoroalcohols to bring about structural changes of proteins. Moreover, pure fluoroalcohol-water mixed solvents were investigated to prove the relation between cluster formation and the effects on proteins. The results demonstrate that cluster formation is mostly an accompanying phenomenon because important structural changes of the proteins occur well below the critical concentration of fluoroalcohol at which the formation of clusters sets in. According to our light scattering experiments, the remarkable potential of HFIP is a consequence of extensive preferential binding. Surprisingly, preferential binding seems to play a vanishing role in the case of TFE. However, the comparable Stokes radii of both proteins in the highly helical state induced by either HFIP or TFE point to a similar degree of solvation in both mixed solvents. This shows that direct binding or an indirect mechanism must be equally taken into consideration to explain the effects of alcohols on proteins. The existence of a compact helical intermediate with non-native secondary structure on the transition of beta-lactoglobulin A from the native to the highly helical state is clearly demonstrated.

protein phosphatase 2A	PP2A	The E4orf4 protein of human adenovirus induces p53-independent apoptosis, a process that may promote cell death and viral spread. When expressed alone, E4orf4 kills transformed cells but not normal human cells. The only clear target of E4orf4 in mammalian cells is the Balpha (B55) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a member of one of three classes of regulatory B subunits. Here we report the effects of E4orf4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes two PP2A regulatory B subunits, CDC55 and RTS1, that share homology with mammalian B and B' subunits, respectively. E4orf4 expression was found to be toxic in yeast, resulting in the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase that failed to grow upon removal of E4orf4. E4orf4-expressing yeast also displayed an elongated cell morphology similar to cdc55 deletion strains. E4orf4 required CDC55 to elicit its effect, whereas RTS1 was dispensable. The recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme by E4orf4 was entirely dependent on Cdc55. These studies indicate that E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells and cell death in yeast require functional interactions with B-type subunits of PP2A. However, some inhibition of growth by E4orf4 was observed in the cdc55 strain and with an E4orf4 mutant that fails to interact with Cdc55, indicating that E4orf4 may possess a second Cdc55-independent function affecting cell growth.
neurofibromatosis type 2	NF2	The mechanism underlying the tumour-suppressor activity of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene product, merlin, is largely undefined but there is evidence that the biological function of the protein might be mediated partly through interactions with the cytoskeleton. Merlin is expressed predominantly as two isoforms that differ at their C-termini owing to alternative splicing of exon 16. By expressing merlin isoform I as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a clone encoding a region of the cytoskeletal protein beta-fodrin. Confirmation of the merlin-fodrin interaction was provided by using the mammalian two-hybrid system and binding assays in vitro. In addition, these assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells revealed that the binding site for fodrin is located in the C-terminal half of merlin at a site that is masked in the native protein. Co-expression of the N-terminus of merlin decreased the interaction of its C-terminus with fodrin, implicating homophilic interactions of merlin isoform I in masking the fodrin-binding site. The effect of three disease-associated mutations on the merlin-fodrin interaction and merlin dimerization was also investigated. The mutation L535P, but not L360P or K413E, significantly decreased the merlin-fodrin interaction but not dimerization, indicating that the tumour suppressor ability of merlin might reside partly in its ability to interact with the cytoskeleton via fodrin.
RNA polymerase III	Pol III	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae U6 RNA gene, SNR6, possesses upstream sequences that allow productive binding in vitro of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription initiation factor IIIB (TFIIIB) in the absence of TFIIIC or other assembly factors. TFIIIC-independent transcription of SNR6 in vitro is highly sensitive to point mutations in a consensus TATA box at position -30. In contrast, the TATA box is dispensable for SNR6 transcription in vivo, apparently because TFIIIC bound to the intragenic A block and downstream B block can recruit TFIIIB via protein-protein interactions. A mutant allele of SNR6 with decreased spacing between the A and B blocks, snr6-Delta42, exhibits increased dependence on the upstream sequences in vivo. Unexpectedly, we find that in vivo expression of snr6-Delta42 is much more sensitive to mutations in a (dT-dA)(7) tract between the TATA box and transcription start site than to mutations in the TATA box itself. Inversion of single base pairs in the center of the dT-dA tract nearly abolishes transcription of snr6-Delta42, yet inversion of all 7 base pairs has little effect on expression, indicating that the dA-dT tract is relatively orientation independent. Although it is within the TFIIIB footprint, point mutations in the dT-dA tract do not inhibit TFIIIB binding or TFIIIC-independent transcription of SNR6 in vitro. In the absence of the chromatin architectural protein Nhp6, dT-dA tract mutations are lethal even when A-to-B block spacing is wild type. We conclude that the (dT-dA)(7) tract and Nhp6 cooperate to direct productive transcription complex assembly on SNR6 in vivo.

hepatitis B virus X protein	HBx	The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is essential for establishing natural viral infection and has been implicated in the development of liver cancer associated with chronic infection. The basis for HBx function in either process is not understood. In cell culture, HBx exhibits pleiotropic activities affecting transcription, DNA repair, cell growth, and apoptotic cell death. Numerous cellular proteins including the p127-kDa subunit of UV-damaged DNA-binding activity have been reported to interact with HBx but the functional significance of these interactions remains unclear. Here we show that the binding of HBx to p127 interferes with cell viability. Mutational analysis reveals that HBx contacts p127 via a region to which no function has been assigned previously. An HBx variant bearing a single-charge reversal substitution within this region loses p127 binding and concomitant cytotoxicity. This mutant regains activity when directly fused to p127. These studies confirm that p127 is an important cellular target of HBx, and they indicate that HBx does not exert its effect by sequestering p127, and thereby preventing its normal function, but instead by conferring to p127 a deleterious activity.

heat shock transcription factor	HSF	The expression of heat shock proteins in response to cellular stresses is dependent on the activity of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF). In yeast, HSF is constitutively bound to DNA; however, the mitigation of negative regulation in response to stress dramatically increases transcriptional activity. Through alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the surface residues of the DNA-binding domain, we have identified a large number of mutants with increased transcriptional activity. Six of the strongest mutations were selected for detailed study. Our studies suggest that the DNA-binding domain is involved in the negative regulation of both the N-terminal and C-terminal activation domains of HSF. These mutations do not significantly affect DNA binding. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that a subset of the mutants may have altered secondary structure, whereas a different subset has decreased thermal stability. Our findings suggest that the regulation of HSF transcriptional activity (under both constitutive and stressed conditions) may be partially dependent on the local topology of the DNA-binding domain. In addition, the DNA-binding domain may mediate key interactions with ancillary factors and/or other intramolecular regulatory regions in order to modulate the complex regulation of HSF's transcriptional activity.
Gbeta binding	GBB	The transmission of the mating signal of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires Ste20p, a member of the serine/threonine protein kinases of the Ste20p/PAK family, to link the Gbeta subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. The binding site of Ste20p to the Gbeta subunit was mapped to a consensus sequence of SSLphiPLI/VXphiphibeta (X for any residue; phi for A, I, L, S or T; beta for basic residues), which was shown to be a novel Gbeta binding (GBB) motif present only in the noncatalytic C-terminal domains of the Ste20p/PAK family of protein kinases (Leeuw, T., Wu, C., Schrag, J. D., Whiteway, M., Thomas, D. Y., and Leberer, E. (1998) Nature 391, 191-195; Leberer, E., Dignard, D., Thomas, D. Y., and Leeuw, T. (2000) Biol. Chem. 381, 427-431). Here, we report the results of an NMR study on two GBB motif peptides and the entire C-terminal domain derived from Ste20p. The NMR data show that the two peptide fragments are not uniquely structured in aqueous solution, but in the presence of 40% trifluoroethanol, the longer 37-residue peptide exhibited two well defined, but flexibly linked helical structure elements. Heteronuclear NMR data indicate that the fully functional 86-residue C-terminal domain of Ste20p is again unfolded in aqueous solution but has helical secondary structure preferences similar to those of the two peptide fragments. The NMR results on the two GBB peptides and the entire GBB domain all indicate that the two important binding residues, Ser(879) and Ser(880), are located at the junction between two helical segments. These experimental observations with the prototype GBB domain of a novel family of Gbeta-controlled effectors may have important implications in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the signal transduction from the heterotrimeric G protein to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
copper	iron	Iron and copper are metals which play an important role in the living world. From a brief consideration of their chemistry and biochemistry we conclude that the early chemistry of life used water soluble ferrous iron while copper was in the water-insoluble Cu(I) state as highly insoluble sulphides. The advent of oxygen was a catastrophic event for most living organisms, and can be considered to be the first general irreversible pollution of the earth. In contrast to the oxidation of iron and its loss of bioavailability as insoluble Fe(III), the oxidation of insoluble Cu(I) led to soluble Cu(II). A new iron biochemistry became possible after the advent of oxygen, with the development of chelators of Fe(III), which rendered iron once again accessible, and with the control of the potential toxicity of iron by its storage in a water soluble, non-toxic, bio-available storage protein (ferritin). Biology also discovered that whereas enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism were designed to operate in the lower portion of the redox spectrum, the arrival of dioxygen created the need for a new redox active metal which could attain higher redox potentials. Copper, now bioavailable, was ideally suited to exploit the oxidizing power of dioxygen. The arrival of copper also coincided with the development of multicellular organisms which had extracellular cross-linked matrices capable of resisting attack by oxygen free radicals. After the initial 'iron age' subsequent evolution moved, not towards a 'copper age', but rather to an 'iron-copper' age. In the second part of the review, this symbiosis of iron and copper is examined in yeast. We then briefly consider iron and copper metabolism in mammals, before looking at iron-copper interactions in mammals, particularly man, and conclude with the reflection that, as in Greek and Roman mythology, a better understanding of the potentially positive interactions between Mars (iron) and Venus (copper) can only be to the advantage of our species.
programmed ribosomal frameshifting	PRF	Our previous demonstration that mutants of 5S rRNA called mof9 can specifically alter efficiencies of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) suggested a role for this ubiquitous molecule in the maintenance of translational reading frame, though the repetitive nature of the 5S rDNA gene (>100 copies/cell) inhibited more detailed analyses. However, given the known interactions between 5S rRNA and ribosomal protein L5 (previously called L1 or YL3) encoded by an essential, single-copy gene, we monitored the effects of a series of well-defined rpl5 mutants on PRF and virus propagation. Consistent with the mof9 results, we find that the rpl5 mutants promoted increased frameshifting efficiencies in both the -1 and +1 directions, and conferred defects in the ability of cells to propagate two endogenous viruses. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that mutant ribosomes had decreased affinities for peptidyl-tRNA. Pharmacological studies showed that sparsomycin, a peptidyltransferase inhibitor that specifically increases the binding of peptidyl-tRNA with ribosomes, was antagonistic to the frameshifting defects of the most severe mutant, and the extent of sparsomycin resistance correlated with the severity of the frameshifting defects in all of the mutants. These results provide biochemical and physiological evidence that one function of L5 is to anchor peptidyl-tRNA to the P-site. A model is presented describing how decreased affinity of ribosomes for peptidyl-tRNA can affect both -1 and +1 frameshifting, and for the effects of sparsomycin.
human Sec3	hSec3	The yeast exocyst complex (also called Sec6/8 complex in higher eukaryotes) is a multiprotein complex essential for targeting exocytic vesicles to specific docking sites on the plasma membrane. It is composed of eight proteins (Sec3, -5, -6, -8, -10, and -15, and Exo70 and -84), with molecular weights ranging from 70 to 144 kDa. Mammalian orthologues for seven of these proteins have been described and here we report the cloning and initial characterization of the remaining subunit, Sec3. Human Sec3 (hSec3) shares 17% sequence identity with yeast Sec3p, interacts in the two-hybrid system with other subunits of the complex (Sec5 and Sec8), and is expressed in almost all tissues tested. In yeast, Sec3p has been proposed to be a spatial landmark for polarized secretion (1), and its localization depends on its interaction with Rho1p (2). We demonstrate here that hSec3 lacks the potential Rho1-binding site and GFP-fusions of hSec3 are cytosolic. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusions of nearly every subunit of the mammalian Sec6/8 complex were expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, but they failed to assemble into a complex with endogenous proteins and localized in the cytosol. Of the subunits tested, only GFP-Exo70 localized to lateral membrane sites of cell-cell contact when expressed in MDCK cells. Cells overexpressing GFP-Exo70 fail to form a tight monolayer, suggesting the Exo70 targeting interaction is critical for normal development of polarized epithelial cells.

nuclear transport factor 2	NTF2	Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a small homodimeric protein that interacts simultaneously with both RanGDP and FxFG nucleoporins. The interaction between NTF2 and Ran is essential for the import of Ran into the nucleus. Here we use mutational analysis to dissect the in vivo role of the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins. We identify a series of surface residues that form a hydrophobic patch on NTF2, which when mutated disrupt the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction. Analysis of these mutants in vivo demonstrates that the strength of this interaction can be significantly reduced without affecting cell viability. However, cells cease to be viable if the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins is abolished completely, indicating that this interaction is essential for the function of NTF2 in vivo. In addition, we have isolated a dominant negative mutant of NTF2, N77Y, which has increased affinity for nucleoporins. Overexpression of the N77Y protein blocks nuclear protein import and concentrates Ran at the nuclear rim. These data support a mechanism in which NTF2 interacts transiently with FxFG nucleoporins to translocate through the pore and import RanGDP into the nucleus.
Heterotetrameric adaptor	AP	Heterotetrameric adaptor (AP) complexes are thought to coordinate cargo recruitment and clathrin assembly during clathrin-coated vesicle biogenesis. We have identified, and characterized the physiological significance of clathrin-binding activities in the two large subunits of the AP-1 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using GST-fusion chromatography, two clathrin-binding sites were defined in the beta1 subunit that match consensus clathrin-binding sequences in other mammalian and yeast clathrin-binding proteins. Clathrin interactions were also identified with the C-terminal region of the gamma subunit. When introduced into chromosomal genes, point mutations in the beta1 clathrin-binding motifs, or deletion of the gamma C-terminal region, reduced association of AP-1 with clathrin in coimmunoprecipitation assays. The beta1 mutations or the gamma truncation individually produced minor effects on AP-1 distribution by subcellular fractionation. However, when beta1 and gamma mutations were combined, severe defects were observed in AP-1 association with membranes and incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles. The combination of subunit mutations accentuated growth and alpha-factor pheromone maturation defects in chc1-ts cells, though not to the extent caused by complete loss of AP-1 activity. Our results suggest that both the beta1 and gamma subunits contribute interactions with clathrin that are important for stable assembly of AP-1 complexes into clathrin coats in vivo.
REV1	hREV1	Most mutations after DNA damage in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are induced by error-prone translesion DNA synthesis employing scRev1 and DNA polymerase zeta that consists of scRev3 and scRev7 proteins. Recently, the human REV1 (hREV1) and REV3 (hREV3) genes were identified, and their products were revealed to be involved in UV-induced mutagenesis, as observed for their yeast counterparts. Human REV7 (hREV7) was also cloned, and its product was found to interact with hREV3, but the biological function of hREV7 remained unknown. We report here the analyses of precise interactions in the human REV proteins. The interaction between hREV1 and hREV7 was identified by the yeast two-hybrid library screening using a bait of hREV7, which was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo binding assays. The homodimerization of hREV7 was also detected in the two-hybrid analysis. In addition, the precise domains for interaction between hREV7 and hREV1 or hREV3 and for hREV7 homodimerization were determined. Although hREV7 interacts with both hREV1 and hREV3, a stable complex formation of the three proteins was undetectable in vitro. These findings suggest the possibility that hREV7 might play an important role in regulating the enzymatic activities of hREV1 and hREV3 for mutagenesis in response to DNA damage.

nexin 1	SNX1	Sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), a peripheral membrane protein, has previously been shown to regulate the cell-surface expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor [Kurten, Cadena and Gill (1996) Science 272, 1008-1010]. Searches of human expressed sequence tag databases with SNX1 revealed eleven related human cDNA sequences, termed SNX2 to SNX12, eight of them novel. Analysis of SNX1-related sequences in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome clearly shows a greatly expanded SNX family in humans in comparison with yeast. On the basis of the predicted protein sequences, all members of this family of hydrophilic molecules contain a conserved 70-110-residue Phox homology (PX) domain, referred to as the SNX-PX domain. Within the SNX family, subgroups were identified on the basis of the sequence similarities of the SNX-PX domain and the overall domain structure of each protein. The members of one subgroup, which includes human SNX1, SNX2, SNX4, SNX5 and SNX6 and the yeast Vps5p and YJL036W, all contain coiled-coil regions within their large C-terminal domains and are found distributed in both membrane and cytosolic fractions, typical of hydrophilic peripheral membrane proteins. Localization of the human SNX1 subgroup members in HeLa cells transfected with the full-length cDNA species revealed a similar intracellular distribution that in all cases overlapped substantially with the early endosome marker, early endosome autoantigen 1. The intracellular localization of deletion mutants and fusions with green fluorescent protein showed that the C-terminal regions of SNX1 and SNX5 are responsible for their endosomal localization. On the basis of these results, the functions of these SNX molecules are likely to be unique to endosomes, mediated in part by interactions with SNX-specific C-terminal sequences and membrane-associated determinants.

transcription factor IIIB	TFIIIB	High levels of RNA polymerase III gene transcription are achieved by facilitated recycling of the polymerase on transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB)-DNA complexes that are stable through multiple rounds of initiation. TFIIIB-DNA complexes in yeast comprise the TATA-binding protein (TBP), the TFIIB-related factor TFIIIB70, and TFIIIB90. The high stability of the TFIIIB-DNA complex is conferred by TFIIIB90 binding to TFIIIB70-TBP-DNA complexes. This stability is thought to result from compound bends introduced in the DNA by TBP and TFIIIB90 and by protein-protein interactions that obstruct DNA dissociation. Here we present biochemical evidence that the high stability of TFIIIB-DNA complexes results from kinetic trapping of the DNA. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the free energies of formation of TFIIIB70-TBP-DNA (DeltaG degrees = -12.10 +/- 0.12 kcal/mol) and TFIIIB-DNA (DeltaG degrees = -11.90 +/- 0.14 kcal/mol) complexes are equivalent whereas a kinetic analysis shows that the half-lives of these complexes (46 +/- 3 min and 95 +/- 6 min, respectively) differ significantly. The differential stability of these isoenergetic complexes demonstrates that TFIIIB90 binding energy is used to drive conformational changes and increase the barrier to complex dissociation.

gyrase b/Hsp90/MutL	GHL	Previously, we reported evidence suggesting that Saccharomyces cerevisiae MutLalpha, composed of Mlh1p and Pms1p, was a functional member of the gyrase b/Hsp90/MutL (GHL) dimeric ATPase superfamily characterized by highly conserved ATPase domains. Similar to other GHL ATPases, these putative ATPase domains of MutLalpha may be important for the recruitment and/or activation of downstream effectors. One downstream effector candidate is Exo1p, a 5'-3' double stranded DNA exonuclease that has previously been implicated in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Here we report yeast two-hybrid results suggesting that Exo1p can interact physically with MutLalpha through the Mlh1p subunit. We also report epistasis analysis involving MutLalpha ATPase mutations combined with exo1Delta. One interpretation of our genetic results is that MutLalpha ATPase domains function to direct Exo1p and other functionally redundant exonucleases during MMR. Finally, our results show that much of the increase in spontaneous mutation observed in an exo1Delta strain is REV3-dependent, in turn suggesting that Exo1p is also involved in one or more MMR-independent mutation avoidance pathways.

proliferating cell nuclear antigen	PCNA	Stimulation of eukaryotic flap endonuclease-1 activities by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is independent of its in vitro interaction via a consensus PCNA binding region.
human flap endonuclease-1	hFEN-1	Interaction between human flap endonuclease-1 (hFEN-1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) represents a good model for interactions between multiple functional proteins involved in DNA metabolic pathways. A region of 9 conserved amino acid residues (residues Gln-337 through Lys-345) in the C terminus of human FEN-1 (hFEN-1) was shown to be responsible for the interaction with PCNA. Our current study indicates that 4 amino acid residues in hFEN-1 (Leu-340, Asp-341, Phe-343, and Phe-344) are critical for human PCNA (hPCNA) interaction. A conserved PCNA interaction motif in various proteins from assorted species has been defined as Q(1)X(2)X(3)(L/I)(4)X(5)X(6)F(7)(F/Y)(8), although our results fail to implicate Q(1) (Gln-337 in hFEN-1) as a crucial residue. Surprisingly, all hFEN-1 mutants, including L340A, D341A, F343A, and F344A, retained hPCNA-mediated stimulation of both exo- and flap endonuclease activities. Furthermore, our in vitro assay showed that hPCNA failed to bind to the scRad27 (yeast homolog of FEN-1) nuclease. However, its nuclease activities were significantly enhanced in the presence of hPCNA. Four additional Saccharomyces cerevisiae scRad27 mutants, including multiple alanine mutants and a deletion mutant of the entire PCNA binding region, were constructed to confirm this result. All of these mutants retained PCNA-driven nuclease activity stimulation. We therefore conclude that stimulation of eukaryotic hFEN-1 nuclease activities by PCNA is independent of its in vitro interaction via the PCNA binding region.

Surprisingly, all hFEN-1 mutants, including L340A, D341A, F343A, and F344A, retained hPCNA-mediated stimulation of both exo- and flap endonuclease activities. Furthermore, our in vitro assay showed that hPCNA failed to bind to the scRad27 (yeast homolog of FEN-1) nuclease. However, its nuclease activities were significantly enhanced in the presence of hPCNA. Four additional Saccharomyces cerevisiae scRad27 mutants, including multiple alanine mutants and a deletion mutant of the entire PCNA binding region, were constructed to confirm this result. All of these mutants retained PCNA-driven nuclease activity stimulation. We therefore conclude that stimulation of eukaryotic hFEN-1 nuclease activities by PCNA is independent of its in vitro interaction via the PCNA binding region.
human flap endonuclease-1	hFEN-1	Interaction between human flap endonuclease-1 (hFEN-1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) represents a good model for interactions between multiple functional proteins involved in DNA metabolic pathways. A region of 9 conserved amino acid residues (residues Gln-337 through Lys-345) in the C terminus of human FEN-1 (hFEN-1) was shown to be responsible for the interaction with PCNA.

general transcription factor complex	TAFs	Gene activity in a eukaryotic cell is regulated by accessory factors to RNA polymerase II, which include the general transcription factor complex TFIID, composed of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Three TAFs that contain histone fold motifs (yTAF17, yTAF60 and yTAF61) are critical for transcriptional regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are found in both TFIID and SAGA, a multicomponent histone acetyltransferase transcriptional coactivator. Although these three TAFs were proposed to assemble into a pseudooctamer complex, we find instead that yTAF17, yTAF60 and yTAF61 form a specific TAF octamer complex with a fourth TAF found in TFIID, yTAF48. We have reconstituted this complex in vitro and established that it is an octamer containing two copies each of the four components. Point mutations within the histone folds disrupt the octamer in vitro, and temperature-sensitive mutations in the histone folds can be specifically suppressed by overexpressing the other TAF octamer components in vivo. Our results indicate that the TAF octamer is similar both in stoichiometry and histone fold interactions to the histone octamer component of chromatin.
morphogenesis checkpoint dependent	MCD	A genetic screen for ethanolamine auxotrophs has identified a novel mutant allele of the morphogenesis checkpoint dependent (MCD)-4 gene, designated mcd4-P301L. In the presence of a null allele for the  phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) decarboxylase 1 gene (psd1 Delta), the mcd4-P301L mutation confers temperature sensitivity for growth on minimal medium. This growth defect is reversed by either ethanolamine or choline supplementation. Incubation of mutant cells with [(3)H]serine followed by analysis of the aminoglycerophospholipids demonstrated a 60% decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) formation compared to parental cells. Chemical analysis of phospholipid content after culture under non-permissive conditions also demonstrated a 60% decrease in the PtdEtn pool compared to the parental strain. Although the morphogenesis checkpoint dependent (MCD)-4 gene and its homologues have been shown to play a role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis, the mcd4-P301L strain displayed normal incorporation of [(3)H]inositol into both proteins and lipids. Thus, a defect in GPI anchor synthesis does not explain either the ethanolamine auxotrophy or biochemical phenotype of this mutant. We also examined the growth characteristics and PtdSer metabolism of a previously described mcd4-174 mutant strain, with defects in GPI anchor synthesis, protein modification and cell wall maintenance. The mcd4-174, psd1 Delta strain is a temperature sensitive ethanolamine auxotroph that requires osmotic support for growth, and displays normal PtdEtn formation compared to parental cells. These results reveal important genetic interactions between PSD1 and MCD4 genes, and provide evidence that Mcd4p can modulate aminoglycerophospholipid metabolism, in a way independent of its role in GPI anchor synthesis.

trisephosphate isomerase	TIM	The thermal denaturation of the dimeric enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. At low protein concentration the structural transition proved to be reversible in thermal scannings conducted at a rate greater than 1.0 degrees C min(-1). Under these conditions, however, the denaturation-renaturation cycle exhibited marked hysteresis. The use of lower scanning rates lead to pronounced irreversibility. Kinetic studies indicated that denaturation of the enzyme likely consists of an initial first-order reaction that forms thermally unfolded (U) TIM, followed by irreversibility-inducing reactions which are probably linked to aggregation of the unfolded protein. As judged from CD measurements, U possesses residual secondary structure but lacks most of the tertiary interactions present in native TIM. Furthermore, the large increment in heat capacity upon denaturation suggests that extensive exposure of surface area occurs when U is formed. Above 63 degrees C, reactions leading to irreversibility were much slower than the unfolding process; as a result, U was sufficiently long-lived as to allow an investigation of its refolding kinetics. We found that U transforms into nativelike TIM through a second-order reaction in which association is coupled to the regain of secondary structure. The rate constants for unfolding and refolding of TIM displayed temperature dependences resembling those reported for monomeric proteins but with considerably larger activation enthalpies. Such large temperature dependences seem to be determinant for the occurrence of kinetically controlled transitions and thus constitute a simple explanation for the hysteresis observed in thermal scannings.

vacuolar ATP binding cassette	ABC	The yeast cadmium factor (Ycf1p) is a vacuolar ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter required for heavy metal and drug detoxification. Cluster analysis shows that Ycf1p is strongly related to the human multidrug-associated protein (MRP1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and therefore may serve as an excellent model for the study of eukaryotic ABC transporter structure and function. Identifying intramolecular interactions in these transporters may help to elucidate energy transfer mechanisms during transport. To identify regions in Ycf1p that may interact to couple ATPase activity to substrate binding and/or movement across the membrane, we sought intragenic suppressors of ycf1 mutations that affect highly conserved residues presumably involved in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. Thirteen intragenic second-site suppressors were identified for the D777N mutation which affects the invariant Asp residue in the Walker B motif of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Two of the suppressor mutations (V543I and F565L) are located in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), nine (A1003V, A1021T, A1021V, N1027D, Q1107R, G1207D, G1207S, S1212L, and W1225C) are found within TMD2, one (S674L) is in NBD1, and another one (R1415G) is in NBD2, indicating either physical proximity or functional interactions between NBD1 and the other three domains. The original D777N mutant protein exhibits a strong defect in the apparent affinity for ATP and V(max) of transport. The phenotypic characterization of the suppressor mutants shows that suppression does not result from restoring these alterations but rather from a change in substrate specificity. We discuss the possible involvement of Asp777 in coupling ATPase activity to substrate binding and/or transport across the membrane.
ribosomal DNA	rDNA	At the end of the 35S rRNA gene within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lies an enhancer that has been shown to greatly stimulate rDNA transcription in ectopic reporter systems. We found, however, that the enhancer is not necessary for normal levels of rRNA synthesis from chromosomal rDNA or for cell growth. Yeast strains which have the entire enhancer from rDNA deleted did not show any defects in growth or rRNA synthesis. We found that the stimulatory activity of the enhancer for ectopic reporters is not observed in cells with disrupted nucleolar structures, suggesting that reporter genes are in general poorly accessible to RNA polymerase I (Pol I) machinery in the nucleolus and that the enhancer improves accessibility. We also found that a fob1 mutation abolishes transcription from the enhancer-dependent rDNA promoter integrated at the HIS4 locus without any effect on transcription from chromosomal rDNA. FOB1 is required for recombination hot spot (HOT1) activity, which also requires the enhancer region, and for recombination within rDNA repeats. We suggest that Fob1 protein stimulates interactions between rDNA repeats through the enhancer region, thus helping ectopic rDNA promoters to recruit the Pol I machinery normally present in the nucleolus.

initiation factor-3	eIF3	Mammalian, plant, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) contains a protein homologous to the product of int-6 (eIF3e), a frequent integration site of mouse mammary tumor viruses. By contrast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not encode a protein closely related to eIF3e/Int-6. Here, we characterize a novel S. cerevisiae protein (Pci8p, Yil071cp) that contains a PCI (proteasome-COP9 signalosome-eIF3) domain conserved in eIF3e/Int-6. We show that both Pci8p and human eIF3e/Int-6 expressed in budding yeast interact with the yeast eIF3 complex in vivo and in vitro by binding to a discrete segment of its eIF3b subunit Prt1p and that human eIF3e/Int-6 interacts with the human eIF3b segment homologous to the Pci8p-binding site of yeast Prt1p. These results refine our understanding of subunit interactions in the eIF3 complex and suggest structural similarity between human eIF3e/Int-6 and yeast Pci8p. However, deletion of PCI8 had no discernible effect on cell growth or translation initiation as judged by polysome analysis, suggesting that Pci8p is not required for the essential function of eIF3 in translation initiation. Motivated by the involvement of Int-6 in transcriptional control, we investigated the effects of deleting PCI8 on the total mRNA expression profile by oligonucleotide microarray analysis and found reduced mRNA levels for a subset of heat shock proteins in the pci8Delta mutant. We discuss possible dual functions of Pci8p and Int-6 in transcriptional and translational control.

nucleotide excision repair	NER	Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet irradiation and various chemical agents that cause bulky adducts. Two subpathways within NER remove damage from the genome overall or the transcribed strands of transcribing genes (TCR). TCR is a faster repair process than overall genomic repair and has been thought to require the RAD26 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad26 is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins that either disrupt chromatin or facilitate interactions between the RNA Pol II and transcription activators. SWI/SNF proteins are required for the expression or repression of a diverse set of genes, many of which are differentially transcribed in response to particular carbon sources. The remodeling of chromatin by Rad26 could affect transcription and/or TCR following formation of DNA damage and other stress-inducing conditions. We speculate that another factor(s) can substitute for Rad26 under particular growth conditions. We therefore measured the level of repair and transcription in two different carbon sources and found that the defect in the rad26 mutant for TCR was dependent on the type of carbon source. Furthermore, TCR did not correlate with transcription rate, suggesting that disruption of RAD26 leads to a specific defect in DNA repair and not transcription.

COperative BINDing	Co-Bind	MOTIVATION: Transcriptional activation in eukaryotic organisms normally requires combinatorial interactions of multiple transcription factors. Though several methods exist for identification of individual protein binding site patterns in DNA sequences, there are few methods for discovery of binding site patterns for cooperatively acting factors. Here we present an algorithm, Co-Bind (for COperative BINDing), for discovering DNA target sites for cooperatively acting transcription factors. The method utilizes a Gibbs sampling strategy to model the cooperativity between two transcription factors and defines position weight matrices for the binding sites. Sequences from both the training set and the entire genome are taken into account, in order to discriminate against commonly occurring patterns in the genome, and produce patterns which are significant only in the training set. RESULTS: We have tested Co-Bind on semi-synthetic and real data sets to show it can efficiently identify DNA target site patterns for cooperatively binding transcription factors. In cases where binding site patterns are weak and cannot be identified by other available methods, Co-Bind, by virtue of modeling the cooperativity between factors, can identify those sites efficiently. Though developed to model protein-DNA interactions, the scope of Co-Bind may be extended to combinatorial, sequence specific, interactions in other macromolecules.

extragenic suppressor	GS	Selection of an extragenic suppressor of fks1-1154 Deltafks2, mutations in the catalytic subunits of yeast 1,3-beta-glucan synthase (GS) conferring temperature-sensitivity, led to the LRG1 gene, which was originally identified as a LIM-RhoGAP homologous gene. Mutations in the LRG1 gene restore impaired 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis in the fks1-1154 Deltafks2 mutant as well as that in rho1-2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rho-type GTPase that functions as a regulatory subunit of GS. Two-hybrid analyses of Lrg1p, which contains a sequence conserved among Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), revealed its specific interactions with the active form of Rho1p. Among eight potential yeast RhoGAPs, Lrg1p is the only member that negatively regulates GS activity: mutations in the rest of GAPs, including bem2, Deltabem3, Deltasac7, Deltabag7, Deltarga1, Deltarga2 and Deltargd1, do not suppress impairment of 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis. Analyses of Mpk1p phosphorylation revealed the inability of Lrg1p to regulate the Pkc1p-MAP kinase cascade, a distinct Rho1p-regulating signalling pathway known to be affected by the GAPs, Bem2p and Sac7p. Thus, different groups of Rho1p GAPs control the activity of different Rho1p-effector proteins. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

dimerization constant of wild type	WT	The Hsp90 dimer is a molecular chaperone with an unusual N-terminal ATP binding site. The structure of the ATP binding site makes it a member of a new class of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes, known as the GHKL family. While for some of the family members structural data on conformational changes occurring after ATP binding are available, these are still lacking for Hsp90. Here we set out to investigate the correlation between dimerization and ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The dimerization constant of wild type (WT) Hsp90 was determined to be 60 nm. Heterodimers of WT Hsp90 with fragments lacking the ATP binding domain form readily and exhibit dimerization constants similar to full-length Hsp90. However, the ATPase activity of these heterodimers was significantly lower than that of the wild type protein, indicating cooperative interactions in the N-terminal part of the protein that lead to the activation of the ATPase activity. To further address the contribution of the N-terminal domains to the ATPase activity, we used an Hsp90 point mutant that is unable to bind ATP. Since heterodimers between the WT protein and this mutant showed WT ATPase activity, this mutant, although unable to bind ATP, still has the ability to stimulate the activity in its WT partner domain. Thus, contact formation between the N-terminal domains might not depend on ATP bound to both domains. Together, these results suggest a mechanism for coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the opening-closing movement of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone.
mismatch repair	MMR	EXO1 interacts with MSH2 and MLH1 and has been proposed to be a redundant exonuclease that functions in mismatch repair (MMR). To better understand the role of EXO1 in mismatch repair, a genetic screen was performed to identify mutations that increase the mutation rates caused by weak mutator mutations such as exo1Delta and pms1-A130V mutations. In a screen starting with an exo1 mutation, exo1-dependent mutator mutations were obtained in MLH1, PMS1, MSH2, MSH3, POL30 (PCNA), POL32, and RNR1, whereas starting with the weak pms1 allele pms1-A130V, pms1-dependent mutator mutations were identified in MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and EXO1. These mutations only cause weak MMR defects as single mutants but cause strong MMR defects when combined with each other. Most of the mutations obtained caused amino acid substitutions in MLH1 or PMS1, and these clustered in either the ATP-binding region or the MLH1-PMS1 interaction regions of these proteins. The mutations showed two other types of interactions: specific pairs of mutations showed unlinked noncomplementation in diploid strains, and the defect caused by pairs of mutations could be suppressed by high-copy-number expression of a third gene, an effect that showed allele and overexpressed gene specificity. These results support a model in which EXO1 plays a structural role in MMR and stabilizes multiprotein complexes containing a number of MMR proteins. A similar role is proposed for PCNA based on the data presented.
high density lipoprotein	HDL	It has been reported that the existing direct method of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol measures particles enriched with apolipoprotein E (apoE). The aim of our study was to investigate a new analytical protocol to directly measure HDL cholesterol that eliminates apoE-rich particles. The interactions of four lipoproteins (HDL(3), HDL(2), LDL, and VLDL + chylomicron) with surfactants, divalent cations, sugars, and lectins were investigated. By analyzing sera, HDL(3), and HDL(2), we examined the relationships among the measurements obtained by our protocol, a precipitation method using heparin-MnCl(2), and a commercially available kit for this direct method. A significant difference was found between the direct method and the heparin-MnCl(2) method, but not between our protocol and the heparin-MnCl(2) method. Multiple regression analysis showed that the difference between the direct method and the heparin MnCl(2) method is dependent on sources of apoE-rich HDL. In conclusion, our protocol enables a direct measurement of HDL cholesterol that eliminates apoE-rich particles. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

neurofibromatosis type 2 gene	NF2	The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF2) is involved in the pathogenesis of benign tumors of the human nervous system. The NF2 protein, called schwannomin or merlin, is inactivated in virtually all schwannomas and meningiomas. The molecular mechanisms by which schwannomin functions as a tumor suppressor is unknown but believed to involve plasma membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. Two major alternatively spliced isoforms of schwannomin differing in their C termini have been reported. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified syntenin as a binding partner for schwannomin isoform-1 (sch-1). Syntenin is an adapter protein that couples transmembrane proteoglycans to cytoskeletal components and is involved in intracellular vesicle transport. The C terminus 25 amino acids of sch-1 and the two PDZ domains of syntenin mediate their binding, and mutations introduced within the VAFFEEL region of sch-1 defined a sequence crucial for syntenin recognition. We have showed that the two proteins interacted in vitro and in vivo and localized underneath the plasma membrane. Fibroblast cells expressing heterologous antisense syntenin display alterations in the subcellular distribution of sch-1. Together, these results provide the first functional clue to the existence of schwannomin isoforms and could unravel novel pathways for the transport and subcellular localization of schwannomin in vivo.

eukaryotic initiation factor-2	eIF2	Mechanism of activation of the double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR: role of dimerization and cellular localization in the stimulation of PKR phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2).
dsRNA-binding domains	dsRBDs	An important defense against viral infection involves inhibition of translation by PKR phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2. Binding of viral dsRNAs to two dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) in PKR leads to relief of an inhibitory region and activation of eIF2 kinase activity. Interestingly, while deletion of the regulatory region of PKR significantly induces activity in vitro, the truncated kinase does not inhibit translation in vivo, suggesting that these sequences carry out additional functions required for PKR control. To delineate these functions and determine the order of events leading to activation of PKR, we fused truncated PKR to domains of known function and assayed the chimeras for in vivo activity. We found that fusion of a heterologous dimerization domain with the PKR catalytic domain enhanced autophosphorylation and eIF2 kinase function in vivo. The dsRBDs also mediate ribosome association and we proposed that such targeting increases the localized concentration of PKR, enhancing interaction between PKR molecules. We addressed this premise by linking the truncated PKR to RAS sequences mediating farnesylation and membrane localization and found that the fusion protein was functional in vivo. These results indicate that cellular localization along with oligomerization enhances interaction between PKR molecules. Alanine substitution for the phosphorylation site, threonine 446, impeded in vivo and in vitro activity of the PKR fusion proteins, while aspartate or glutamate substitutions partially restored the function of the truncated kinase. These results indicate that both dimerization and cellular localization play a role in transient protein-protein interactions and that trans-autophosphorylation is the final step in the mechanism of activation of PKR.
gross chromosome rearrangements	GCRs	Gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs), such as translocations, deletion of a chromosome arm, interstitial deletions and inversions, are often observed in cancer cells. Spontaneous GCRs are rare in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, the existence of mutator mutants with increased genome instability suggests that GCRs are actively suppressed. Here we show by genetic analysis that these genome rearrangements probably result from DNA replication errors and are suppressed by at least three interacting pathways or groups of proteins: S-phase checkpoint functions, recombination proteins and proteins that prevent de novo addition of telomeres at double-strand breaks (DSBs). Mutations that inactivate these pathways cause high rates of GCRs and show synergistic interactions, indicating that the pathways that suppress GCRs all compete for the same DNA substrates.

chromatid recombination	SCR	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes RAD5, RAD18, and SRS2 are proposed to act in post-replicational repair of DNA damage. We have investigated the genetic interactions between mutations in these genes with respect to cell survival and ectopic gene conversion following treatment of logarithmic and early stationary cells with UV- and gamma-rays. We find that the genetic interaction between the rad5 and rad18 mutations depends on DNA damage type and position in the cell cycle at the time of treatment. Inactivation of SRS2 suppresses damage sensitivity both in rad5 and rad18 mutants, but only when treated in logarithmic phase. When irradiated in stationary phase, the srs2 mutation enhances the sensitivity of rad5 mutants, whereas it has no effect on rad18 mutants. Irrespective of the growth phase, the srs2 mutation reduces the frequency of damage-induced ectopic gene conversion in rad5 and rad18 mutants. In addition, we find that srs2 mutants exhibit reduced spontaneous and UV-induced sister chromatid recombination (SCR), whereas rad5 and rad18 mutants are proficient for SCR. We propose a model in which the Srs2 protein has pro-recombinogenic or anti-recombinogenic activity, depending on the context of the DNA damage.
pseudouridine	psi	The removal of noncoding sequences (introns) from eukaryotic precursor mRNA is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a dynamic assembly involving specific and sequential RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. An essential RNA-RNA pairing between the U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA and a complementary consensus sequence of the intron, called the branch site, results in positioning of the 2'OH of an unpaired intron adenosine residue to initiate nucleophilic attack in the first step of splicing. To understand the structural features that facilitate recognition and chemical activity of the branch site, duplexes representing the paired U2 snRNA and intron sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined by solution NMR spectroscopy. Oligomers were synthesized with pseudouridine (psi) at a conserved site on the U2 snRNA strand (opposite an A-A dinucleotide on the intron strand, one of which forms the branch site) and with uridine, the unmodified analog. Data from NMR spectra of nonexchangeable protons demonstrated A-form helical backbone geometry and continuous base stacking throughout the unmodified molecule. Incorporation of psi at the conserved position, however, was accompanied by marked deviation from helical parameters and an extrahelical orientation for the unpaired adenosine. Incorporation of psi also stabilized the branch-site interaction, contributing -0.7 kcal/mol to duplex deltaG degrees 37. These findings suggest that the presence of this conserved U2 snRNA pseudouridine induces a change in the structure and stability of the branch-site sequence, and imply that the extrahelical orientation of the branch-site adenosine may facilitate recognition of this base during splicing.
protein disulphide-isomerase	PDI	The rat luminal endoplasmic-recticulum calcium-binding proteins 1 and 2 (CaBP1 and CaBP2 respectively) are members of the protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) family. They contain two and three thioredoxin boxes (Cys-Gly-His-Cys) respectively and, like PDI, may be involved in the folding of nascent proteins. We demonstrate here that CaBP1, similar to PDI and CaBP2, can complement the lethal phenotype of the disrupted Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDI gene, provided that the natural C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence is replaced by His-Asp-Glu-Leu. Both the in vitro RNase AIII-re-activation assays and in vivo pro-(carboxypeptidase Y) processing assays using CaBP1 and CaBP2 thioredoxin (trx)-box mutants revealed that, whereas the three trx boxes in CaBP2 seem to be functionally equivalent, the first trx box of CaBP1 is significantly more active than the second trx box. Furthermore, only about 65% re-activation of denatured reduced RNase AIII could be obtained with CaBP1 or CaBP2 compared with PDI, and the yield of PDI-catalysed reactions was significantly reduced in the presence of either CaBP1 or CaBP2. In contrast with PDI, neither CaBP1 nor CaBP2 could catalyse the renaturation of denatured glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is a redox-independent process, and neither protein had any effect on the PDI-catalysed refolding of GAPDH. Furthermore, although PDI can bind peptides via its b' domain, a property it shares with PDIp, the pancreas-specific PDI homologue, and although PDI can bind malfolded proteins such as 'scrambled' ribonuclease, no such interactions could be detected for CaBP2. We conclude that: (1) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 lack peptide-binding activity for GAPDH attributed to the C-terminal region of the a' domain of PDI; (2) CaBP2 lacks the general peptide-binding activity attributed to the b' domain of PDI; (3) interaction of CaBP2 with substrate (RNase AIII) is different from that of PDI and substrate; and (4) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 may promote oxidative folding by different kinetic pathways.

Clathrin adaptor protein	AP	Clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes are heterotetramers composed of two large, one medium, and one small subunits. By exploiting the yeast three-hybrid system, we have found that an interaction between the two large subunits of the AP-1 complex, gamma-adaptin and beta1-adaptin, is markedly enhanced in the presence of the small subunit, sigma1. Similarly, two large subunits of the AP-4 complex, epsilon-adaptin and beta4-adaptin, are found to interact with each other only in the presence of the small subunit, sigma4. Furthermore, we have found that an interaction between two large subunits of the COPI F subcomplex, gamma-COP and beta-COP, is detectable only in the presence of zeta-COP. Because these COPI subunits have common ancestral origins to the corresponding AP subunits, these three-hybrid data, taken together with the previous two-hybrid data, suggest that the AP complexes and the COPI F subcomplex assemble by virtue of similar subunit interactions.

nuclear pore complexes	NPC	Export of mRNA through nuclear pore complexes (NPC) is preceded by multiple and well coordinated processing steps, resulting in the formation of an export competent ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP). Numerous factors involved in the translocation of the mRNP through the NPC and its release into the cytoplasm have been isolated mainly through genetic approaches in yeast, and putative functional homologues have been identified in metazoan systems. Understanding the mechanism of mRNA export relies, in part, on the functional characterization of these factors and the establishment of a complete network of molecular interactions. Here we summarize recent progress in the characterization of yeast and mammalian components implicated in the export of an mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
amino-terminal ubiquitin-like	ubl	Previous studies suggest that the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (ubl) domain of Rad23 protein can recruit the proteasome for a stimulatory role during nucleotide excision repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this report, we show that the 19S regulatory complex of the yeast proteasome can affect nucleotide excision repair independently of Rad23 protein. Strains with mutations in 19S regulatory subunits (but not 20S subunits) of the proteasome promote partial recovery of nucleotide excision repair in vivo in rad23 deletion mutants, but not in other nucleotide excision repair-defective strains tested. In addition, a strain that expresses a temperature-degradable ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory complex manifests a dramatically increased rate of nucleotide excision repair in vivo. These data indicate that the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome can negatively regulate the rate of nucleotide excision repair in yeast and suggest that Rad23 protein not only recruits the 19S regulatory complex, but also can mediate functional interactions between the 19S regulatory complex and the nucleotide excision repair machinery. The 19S regulatory complex of the yeast proteasome functions in nucleotide excision repair independent of proteolysis.
mitotic exit network	MEN	Exit from mitosis in budding yeast requires inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases through mechanisms triggered by the protein phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 activity, in turn, is regulated by a group of proteins, the mitotic exit network (MEN), which includes Lte1, Tem1, Cdc5, Cdc15, Dbf2/Dbf20, and Mob1. The direct biochemical interactions between the components of the MEN remain largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that underlie activation of the protein kinase Dbf2. Dbf2 kinase activity depended on Tem1, Cdc15, and Mob1 in vivo. In vitro, recombinant protein kinase Cdc15 activated recombinant Dbf2, but only when Dbf2 was bound to Mob1. Conserved phosphorylation sites Ser-374 and Thr-544 (present in the human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster relatives of Dbf2) were required for DBF2 function in vivo, and activation of Dbf2-Mob1 by Cdc15 in vitro. Although Cdc15 phosphorylated Dbf2, Dbf2-Mob1, and Dbf2(S374A/T544A)-Mob1, the pattern of phosphate incorporation into Dbf2 was substantially altered by either the S374A T544A mutations or omission of Mob1. Thus, Cdc15 promotes the exit from mitosis by directly switching on the kinase activity of Dbf2. We propose that Mob1 promotes this activation process by enabling Cdc15 to phosphorylate the critical Ser-374 and Thr-544 phosphoacceptor sites of Dbf2.
DNA-binding domain	DBD	The detection of physical interaction between two or more molecules of interest can be facilitated if the act of association between the interactive partners leads to the production of a readily observed biological or physical readout. Many interacting molecule pairs (X, Y) can be made to induce such a readout if X and Y are each fused to defined protein elements with desired properties. For example, in the yeast forward two-hybrid system, X is synthesized as a translational fusion to a DNA-binding domain (DBD), Y is synthesized as a fusion to a transcriptional activation domain (AD), and coexpression of DBD-X and AD-Y induces transcription of easily scored responsive reporters. Other approaches use paradigms based on the artificial production of two, hybrid, molecules, but substitute a variety of readouts including the repression of transcription, activation of signal transduction pathways, or reconstitution of a disrupted enzymatic activity. In this article, we summarize a number of two-hybrid-based approaches, and detail the use of the forward yeast two-hybrid system in a screen to identify novel interacting partners for a protein of interest.

Opt1p	TMD	The model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two distinct peptide transport mechanisms, one for di-/tripeptides (the PTR system) and another for tetra-/pentapeptides (the OPT system). The PTR system consists of three genes, PTR1, PTR2 and PTR3. The transporter (Ptr2p), encoded by the gene PTR2, is a 12 transmembrane domain (TMD) integral membrane protein that translocates di-/tripeptides. Homologues to Ptr2p have been identified in virtually all organisms examined to date and comprise the PTR family of transport proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the expression of PTR2 is highly regulated at the cellular level by complex interactions of many genes, including PTR1, PTR3, CUP9 and SSY1. Oligopeptides, consisting of four to five amino acids, are transported by the 12-14 TMD integral membrane protein Opt1p. Unlike Ptr2p, distribution of this protein appears limited to fungi and plants, and there appears to be three paralogues in S. cerevisiae. This transporter has an affinity for enkephalin, an endogenous mammalian pentapeptide, as well as for glutathione. Although it is known that OPT1 is normally expressed only during sporulation, to date little is known about the genes and proteins involved in the regulation of OPT1 expression.
carboxy-terminal domain	CTD	BUR1, which was previously identified by a selection for mutations that have general effects on transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase that is essential for viability, but none of its substrates have been identified to date. Using an unbiased biochemical approach, we have identified the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, as a Bur1 substrate. Phosphorylation of Rpb1 by Bur1 is likely to be physiologically relevant, since bur1 mutations interact genetically with rpb1 CTD truncations and with mutations in other genes involved in CTD function. Several genetic interactions are presented, implying a role for Bur1 during transcriptional elongation. These results identify Bur1 as a fourth S. cerevisiae CTD kinase and provide striking functional similarities between Bur1 and metazoan P-TEFb.
cytochrome c oxidase	COX	Surf1p is a protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. However its exact role in this process remains to be elucidated. We studied SHY1, the yeast homologue of SURF1, with an aim to obtain a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency in SURF1 mutant cells from Leigh syndrome patients. Assembly of COX was analysed in a shy1 null mutant strain by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Steady-state levels of the enzyme were found to be strongly reduced, the total amount of assembled complex being approximately 30% of control. The presence of a significant amount of holo-COX in the SHY1-disruptant strain suggests that Shy1p may either facilitate assembly of the enzyme, or increase its stability. However, our observations, based on 2D-PAGE analysis of mitochondria labelled in vitro, now provide the first direct evidence that COX assembly is impaired in a Deltashy1 strain. COX enzyme assembled in the absence of Shy1p appears to be structurally and enzymically normal. The in vitro labelling studies additionally indicate that mitochondrial translation is significantly increased in the shy1 null mutant strain, possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism for reduced respiratory capacity. Protein interactions of both Shy1p and Surf1p are implied by their appearance in a high molecular weight complex of about 250 kDa, as shown by 2D-PAGE.
TATA-binding protein	TBP	Binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to promoter DNA bearing the TATA sequence is an obligatory initial step in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. The interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBP with the E4 (TATATATA) and adenovirus major late (TATAAAAG) promoters have been modeled via global analysis of kinetic and thermodynamic data obtained using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A linear two-intermediate kinetic mechanism describes the reaction of both of these consensus strong promoters with TBP. Qualitative features common to both interactions include tightly bound TBP-DNA complexes with similar solution geometries, simultaneous DNA binding and bending, and the presence of intermediate TBP-DNA conformers at high mole fraction throughout most of the reaction and at equilibrium. Despite very similar energetic changes overall, the stepwise entropic and enthalpic compensations along the two pathways differ markedly following the initial binding/bending event. Furthermore, TBP-E4 dissociation ensues from both replacement and displacement processes, in contrast to replacement alone for TBP-adenovirus major late promoter. A model is proposed that explicitly correlates these similarities and differences with the sequence-specific structural properties inherent to each promoter. This detailed mechanistic comparison of two strong promoters interacting with TBP provides a foundation for subsequent comparison between consensus and variant promoter sequences reacting with TBP.
arabidopsis Snf1-related protein kinases	SnRKs	Arabidopsis Snf1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) are implicated in pleiotropic regulation of metabolic, hormonal and stress responses through their interaction with the kinase inhibitor PRL1 WD-protein. Here we show that SKP1/ASK1, a conserved SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase subunit, which suppresses the skp1-4 mitotic defect in yeast, interacts with the PRL1-binding C-terminal domains of SnRKs. The same SnRK domains recruit an SKP1/ASK1-binding proteasomal protein, alpha4/PAD1, which enhances the formation of a trimeric SnRK complex with SKP1/ASK1 in vitro. By contrast, PRL1 reduces the interaction of SKP1/ASK1 with SnRKs. SKP1/ASK1 is co-immunoprecipitated with a cullin SCF subunit (AtCUL1) and an SnRK kinase, but not with PRL1 from Arabidopsis cell extracts. SKP1/ASK1, cullin and proteasomal alpha-subunits show nuclear co-localization in differentiated Arabidopsis cells, and are observed in association with mitotic spindles and phragmoplasts during cell division. Detection of SnRK in purified 26S proteasomes and co-purification of epitope- tagged SKP1/ASK1 with SnRK, cullin and proteasomal alpha-subunits indicate that the observed protein interactions between SnRK, SKP1/ASK1 and alpha4/PAD1 are involved in proteasomal binding of an SCF ubiquitin ligase in Arabidopsis.

vacuolar protein sorting	VPS	Vesicle-mediated protein sorting plays an important role in segregation of intracellular molecules into distinct organelles. Extensive genetic studies using yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. However, their mammalian counterparts are not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified two human homologues of yeast Class C VPS genes, human VPS11 (hVPS11) and human VPS18 (hVPS18). We also characterized the subcellular localization and interactions of the protein products not only from these genes but also from the other mammalian Class C VPS homologue genes, hVPS16 and rVPS33a. The protein products of hVPS11 (hVps11) and hVPS18 (hVps18) were ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues, suggesting that they have a fundamental role in cellular function. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration studies showed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins constitute a large hetero-oligomeric complex that interacts with syntaxin-7. These results indicate that like their yeast counterparts, mammalian Class C Vps proteins mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway.

Extensive genetic studies using yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. However, their mammalian counterparts are not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified two human homologues of yeast Class C VPS genes, human VPS11 (hVPS11) and human VPS18 (hVPS18). We also characterized the subcellular localization and interactions of the protein products not only from these genes but also from the other mammalian Class C VPS homologue genes, hVPS16 and rVPS33a. The protein products of hVPS11 (hVps11) and hVPS18 (hVps18) were ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues, suggesting that they have a fundamental role in cellular function. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration studies showed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins constitute a large hetero-oligomeric complex that interacts with syntaxin-7. These results indicate that like their yeast counterparts, mammalian Class C Vps proteins mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway.

Circular dichroism	CD	The yeast cell adhesion protein alpha-agglutinin is expressed on the surface of a free-living organism and is subjected to a variety of environmental conditions. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy shows that the binding region of alpha-agglutinin has a beta-sheet-rich structure, with only approximately 2% alpha-helix under native conditions (15-40 degrees C at pH 5.5). This region is predicted to fold into three immunoglobulin-like domains, and models are consistent with the CD spectra as well as with peptide mapping and site-specific mutagenesis. However, secondary structure prediction algorithms show that segments comprising approximately 17% of the residues have high alpha-helical and low beta-sheet potential. Two model peptides of such segments had helical tendencies, and one of these peptides showed pH-dependent conformational switching. Similarly, CD spectroscopy of the binding region of alpha-agglutinin showed reversible conversion from beta-rich to mixed alpha/beta structure at elevated temperatures or when the pH was changed. The reversibility of these changes implied that there is a small energy difference between the all-beta and the alpha/beta states. Similar changes followed cleavage of peptide or disulfide bonds. Together, these observations imply that short sequences of high helical propensity are constrained to a beta-rich state by covalent and local charge interactions under native conditions, but form helices under non-native conditions.
cyclin dependent kinases	CDK	INTRODUCTION: Comprehension of cell cycle regulation mechanisms has progressed very quickly these past few years and regulators of the cell cycle have gained widespread importance in cancer. This review first summarizes major advances in the understanding of the control of cell cycle mechanisms. Examples of how this control is altered in tumoral cells are then described. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The typical mammalian cell cycle consists of four distinct phases occurring in a well-defined order, each of which should be completed successfully before the next begins. Progression of eukaryotic cells through major cell cycle transitions is mediated by sequential assembly and activation of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK). The timing of their activation is determined by their post-translational modifications (phosphorylations/dephosphorylations), and by the association of a protein called cyclin, which is the regulatory subunit of the kinase complex. The cyclin family is divided into two main classes. The 'G1 cyclins' include cyclins C, D1-3, and E, and their accumulation is rate-limiting for progression from the G1 to S phase. The 'mitotic or G2 cyclins', which include cyclin A and cyclin B, are involved in the control of G2/M transition and mitosis. The cyclins bind to and activate the CDK, which leads to phosphorylation (and then inhibition) of the tumor suppressor protein, pRb. pRb controls commitment to progress from the G1 to S phase, at least in part by repressing the activity of the E2F transcription factors known to promote cell proliferation. Both the D-type cyclins and their partner kinases CDK4/6 have proto-oncogenic properties, and their activity is carefully regulated at multiple levels including negative control by two families of CDK inhibitors. While members of the INK4 family (p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D) interact specifically with CDK4 and CDK6, the CIP/KIP inhibitors p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2 inhibit a broader spectrum of CDK. The interplay between p16INK4A, cyclin D/CDK, and pRb/E2F together constitute a functional unit collectively known as the 'pRb pathway'. Each of the major components of this mechanism may become deregulated in cancer, and accumulating evidence points to the 'pRb pathway' as a candidate obligatory target in multistep oncogenesis of possibly all human tumor types. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Major advances in the understanding of cell cycle regulation mechanisms provided a better knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in human cancer. This progress has led to the promotion of new therapeutic agents presently in clinical trials or under development. Moreover, the components of the cell cycle are probably involved in other non-cancerous diseases and their role must be defined.
fluoroorotic acid	5-FOA	The yeast reverse two-hybrid system is a powerful technique for isolating mutations in a protein that abolish its interaction with a known partner. Selection is based on abrogation of growth suppression imposed when wild-type interactions confer 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) sensitivity to yeast cells. A laborious component of this system is to eliminate those mutations that cause protein truncation. By fusing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of a protein of interest, dynein light chain (LC8), we were able to rapidly isolate mutations that did not result in protein truncation.

diacylglycerol kinase-zeta	DGK-zeta	Syntrophins are modular adapter proteins that link ion channels and signaling proteins to dystrophin and its homologues. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the PDZ domain of gamma 1- syntrophin, a recently identified brain-specific isoform, yielded overlapping clones encoding the C terminus of diacylglycerol kinase-zeta (DGK-zeta), an enzyme that converts diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid. In biochemical assays, the C terminus of DGK-zeta, which contains a consensus PDZ-binding motif, was found to be necessary and sufficient for association with gamma 1-syntrophin. When coexpressed in HeLa cells, DGK-zeta and gamma 1-syntrophin formed a stable complex that partitioned between the cytoplasm and nucleus. DGK-zeta translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, a process negatively regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation. We found that DGK-zeta recruits gamma 1-syntrophin into the nucleus and that the PDZ-binding motif is required. Disrupting the interaction altered the intracellular localization of both proteins; DGK-zeta accumulated in the nucleus, whereas gamma 1-syntrophin remained in the cytoplasm. The level of endogenous syntrophins in the nucleus of HeLa cells also reflected the amount of nuclear DGK-zeta. In the brain, DGK-zeta and gamma 1-syntrophin were colocalized in cell bodies and dendrites of cerebellar Purkinjie neurons and other neuronal cell types, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments from brain extracts and cells suggest that DGK-zeta, gamma 1-syntrophin, and dystrophin form a ternary complex. Collectively, our results suggest that gamma 1-syntrophin participates in regulating the subcellular localization of DGK-zeta to ensure correct termination of diacylglycerol signaling.
cleavage factor I	CF I	Cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNA 3' ends in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires several factors, one of which is cleavage factor I (CF I). Purification of CF I activity from yeast extract has implicated numerous proteins as functioning in both cleavage and/or polyadenylation. Through reconstitution of active CF I from separately expressed and purified proteins, we show that CF I contains five subunits, Rna14, Rna15, Pcf11, Clp1, and Hrp1. These five are necessary and sufficient for reconstitution of cleavage activity in vitro when mixed with CF II, and for specific polyadenylation when mixed with polyadenylation factor I, purified poly(A) polymerase, and poly(A) binding protein. Analysis of the individual protein-protein interactions supports an architectural model for CF I in which Pcf11 simultaneously interacts with Rna14, Rna15, and Clp1, whereas Rna14 bridges Rna15 and Hrp1.
replication factor C	RFC	The large subunit of replication protein A (Rpa1) consists of three single-stranded DNA binding domains and an N-terminal domain (Rpa1N) of unknown function. To determine the essential role of this domain we searched for mutations that require wild-type Rpa1N for viability in yeast. A mutation in RFC4, encoding a small subunit of replication factor C (RFC), was found to display allele-specific interactions with mutations in the gene encoding Rpa1 (RFA1). Mutations that map to Rpa1N and confer sensitivity to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, such as rfa1-t11, are lethal in combination with rfc4-2. The rfc4-2 mutant itself is sensitive to hydroxyurea, and like rfc2 and rfc5 strains, it exhibits defects in the DNA replication block and intra-S checkpoints. RFC4 and the DNA damage checkpoint gene RAD24 were found to be epistatic with respect to DNA damage sensitivity. We show that the rfc4-2 mutant is defective in the G(1)/S DNA damage checkpoint response and that both the rfc4-2 and rfa1-t11 strains are defective in the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint. Thus, in addition to its essential role as part of the clamp loader in DNA replication, Rfc4 plays a role as a sensor in multiple DNA checkpoint pathways. Our results suggest that a physical interaction between Rfc4 and Rpa1N is required for both roles.
mitochondrial outer membrane	Tom	The precursor protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Tom) is a multi-subunit complex containing receptors and a general import channel, of which the core component is Tom40p. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins are first recognized by surface receptors and then pass through the import channel. The Tom complex has been purified; however, the protein-protein interactions that drive its assembly and maintain its stability have been difficult to study. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom40p expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity associates efficiently with itself. The self-association is very strong and can withstand up to 4 M urea or 1 M salt. The tight self-association does not require the N-terminal segment of Tom40p. Furthermore, purified Tom40p preferentially recognizes the targeting sequence of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Although the binding of the targeting sequence to Tom40p is inhibited by urea concentrations in excess of 1 M, it is moderately resistant to 1 M salt. Simultaneous self-assembly and precursor protein binding suggest that Tom40p contains at least two different domains mediating these processes. The experimental approach described here should be useful for analysing protein-protein interactions involving individual or groups of components of the mitochondrial import machinery.
TATA-binding protein	TBP	The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is composed of a highly conserved core domain sufficient for TATA-element binding and preinitiation complex formation as well as a highly divergent N-terminal region that is dispensable for yeast cell viability. In vitro, removal of the N-terminal region domain enhances TBP-TATA association and TBP dimerization. Here, we examine the effects of truncation of the N-terminal region in the context of yeast TBP mutants with specific defects in DNA binding and in interactions with various proteins. For a subset of mutations that disrupt DNA binding and the response to transcriptional activators, removal of the N-terminal domain rescues their transcriptional defects. By contrast, deletion of the N-terminal region is lethal in combination with mutations on a limited surface of TBP. Although this surface is important for interactions with TFIIA and Brf1, TBP interactions with these two factors do not appear to be responsible for this dependence on the N-terminal region. Our results suggest that the N-terminal region of TBP has at least two distinct functions in vivo. It inhibits the interaction of TBP with TATA elements, and it acts positively in combination with a specific region of the TBP core domain that presumably interacts with another protein(s).
mitochondrial phosphate transport protein	PTP	The mitochondrial phosphate transport protein (PTP) has six (A--F) transmembrane (TM) helices per subunit of functional homodimer with all mutations referring to the subunit of the homodimer. In earlier studies, conservative replacements of several residues located either at the matrix end (Asp39/helix A, Glu137/helix C, Asp236/helix E) or at the membrane center (His32/helix A, Glu136/helix C) of TM helices yielded inactive single mutation PTPs. Some of these residues were suggested to act as phosphate ligands or as part of the proton cotransport path. We now show that the mutation Ser158Thr, not part of a TM helix but located near the center of the matrix loop (Ile141--Ser171) between TM helices C and D, inactivates PTP and is thus also functionally relevant. On the other side of the membrane, the single mutation Glu192Asp at the intermembrane space end of TM helix D yields a PTP with 33% wild-type activity. We constructed double mutants by adding this mutation to the six transport-inactivating mutations. Transport was detected only in those with Asp39Asn, Glu137Gln, or Ser158Thr. We conclude that TM helix D can interact with TM helices A and C and matrix loop Ile141--Ser171 and that Asp39, Glu137, and Ser158 are not essential for phosphate transport. Since our results are consistent with residues present in all 12 functionally identified members of the mitochondrial transport protein (MTP) family, they lead to a general rule that specifies MTP residue types at 7 separate locations. The conformations of all the double mutation PTPs (except that with the matrix loop Ser158Thr) are significantly different from those of the single mutation PTPs, as indicated by their very low liposome incorporation efficiency and their requirement for less detergent (Triton X-100) to stay in solution. These dramatic conformational differences also suggest an interaction between TM helices D and E. The results are discussed in terms of TM helix movements and changes in the PTP monomer/dimer ratio.

transfer RNA	tRNA	Transfer RNA (tRNA) identity determinants help preserve the specificity of aminoacylation in vivo, and prevent cross-species interactions. Here, we investigate covariation between the discriminator base (N73) element in histidine tRNAs and residues in the histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) motif 2 loop. A model of the Escherichia coli HisRS--tRNA(His) complex predicts an interaction between the prokaryotic conserved glutamine 118 of the motif 2 loop and cytosine 73. The substitution of Gln 118 in motif 2 with glutamate decreased discrimination between cytosine and uracil some 50-fold, but left overall rates of adenylation and aminoacylation unaffected. By contrast, substitutions at neighboring Glu 115 and Arg 121 affected both adenylation and aminoacylation, consistent with their predicted involvement in both half-reactions. Additional evidence for the involvement of the motif 2 loop was provided by functional analysis of a hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae-- E. coli HisRS possessing the 11 amino acid motif 2 loop of the yeast enzyme. Despite an overall decreased activity of nearly 1000-fold relative to the E. coli enzyme, the chimera nevertheless exhibited a modest preference for the yeast tRNA(His) over the E. coli tRNA, and preferred wild-type yeast tRNA(His) to a variant with C at the discriminator position. These experiments suggest that part of, but not all of, the specificity is provided by the motif 2 loop. The close interaction between enzyme loop and RNA sequence elements suggested by these experiments reflects a covariation between enzyme and tRNA that may have acted to preserve aminoacylation fidelity over evolutionary time.

cytotoxic T lymphocytes	CTLs	There is currently a need for vaccines that stimulate cell-mediated immunity-particularly that mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)-against viral and tumor antigens. The optimal induction of cell-mediated immunity requires the presentation of antigens by specialized cells of the immune system called dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are unique in their ability to process exogenous antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway as well as in their ability to activate naive, antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Vaccine strategies that target or activate DCs in order to elicit potent CTL-mediated immunity are the subject of intense research. We report here that whole recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast expressing tumor or HIV-1 antigens potently induced antigen-specific, CTL responses, including those mediating tumor protection, in vaccinated animals. Interactions between yeast and DCs led to DC maturation, IL-12 production and the efficient priming of MHC class I- and class II-restricted, antigen-specific T-cell responses. Yeast exerted a strong adjuvant effect, augmenting DC presentation of exogenous whole-protein antigen to MHC class I- and class II-restricted T cells. Recombinant yeast represent a novel vaccine strategy for the induction of broad-based cellular immune responses.

nucleotide excision repair	NER	Rad23 is a highly conserved protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) that associates with the proteasome via its N-terminus. Its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. However, the cellular function of UBA domains is not completely understood. Recently, RAD23 and DDI1, both DNA damage-inducible genes encoding proteins with UBA domains, were implicated genetically in Pds1-dependent mitotic control in yeast. The UBA domains of RAD23 and DDI1 are required for these interactions. Timely degradation of Pds1 via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway allows anaphase onset and is crucial for chromosome maintenance. Here, we show that Rad23 and Ddi1 interact directly with ubiquitin and that this interaction is dependent on their UBA domains, providing a possible mechanism for UBA-dependent cell cycle control. Moreover, we show that a hydrophobic surface on the UBA domain, which from structural work had been predicted to be a protein-protein interaction interface, is indeed required for ubiquitin binding. By demonstrating that UBA domains interact with ubiquitin, we have provided the first indication of a cellular function for the UBA domain.

subunit origin recognition complex	ORC	The six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) was originally identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors, such as Cdc6 and the Mcm proteins. Human homologues of all six ORC subunits have been identified by sequence similarity to their yeast counterparts, but little is known about the biochemical characteristics of human ORC (HsORC). We have extracted HsORC from HeLa cell chromatin and probed its subunit composition using specific antibodies. The endogenous HsORC, identified in these experiments, contained homologues of Orc1-Orc5 but lacked a putative homologue of Orc6. By expressing HsORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system, we were able to identify a complex containing all six subunits. To explore the subunit-subunit interactions that are required for the assembly of HsORC, we carried out extensive co-immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant ORC subunits expressed in different combinations. These studies revealed the following binary interactions: HsOrc2-HsOrc3, HsOrc2-HsOrc4, HsOrc3-HsOrc4, HsOrc2-HsOrc6, and HsOrc3-HsOrc6. HsOrc5 did not form stable binary complexes with any other HsORC subunit but interacted with sub-complexes containing any two of subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, or HsOrc4. Complex formation by HsOrc1 required the presence of HsOrc2, HsOrc3, HsOrc4, and HsOrc5 subunits. These results suggest that the subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, and HsOrc4 form a core upon which the ordered assembly of HsOrc5 and HsOrc1 takes place. The characterization of HsORC should facilitate the identification of human origins of DNA replication.
GAL4 dimerization domain	GAL4-dd	The GAL4 dimerization domain (GAL4-dd) is a powerful transcriptional activator when tethered to DNA in a cell bearing a mutant of the GAL11 protein, named GAL11P. GAL11P (like GAL11) is a component of the RNA-polymerase II holoenzyme. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of GAL4-dd revealed an elongated dimer structure with C(2) symmetry containing three helices that mediate dimerization via coiled-coil contacts. The two loops between the three coiled coils form mobile bulges causing a variation of twist angles between the helix pairs. Chemical shift perturbation analysis mapped the GAL11P-binding site to the C-terminal helix alpha3 and the loop between alpha1 and alpha2. One GAL11P monomer binds to one GAL4-dd dimer rendering the dimer asymmetric and implying an extreme negative cooperativity mechanism. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of GAL4-dd showed that the NMR-derived GAL11P-binding face is crucial for the novel transcriptional activating function of the GAL4-dd on GAL11P interaction. The binding of GAL4 to GAL11P, although an artificial interaction, represents a unique structural motif for an activating region capable of binding to a single target to effect gene expression.

coactosin-like protein	CLP	We have recently identified coactosin-like protein (CLP) in a yeast two-hybrid screen using 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) as a bait. In this report, we demonstrate a direct interaction between 5LO and CLP. 5LO associated with CLP, which was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using epitope-tagged 5LO and CLP proteins transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed the presence of CLP in 5LO immunoprecipitates. In reciprocal experiments, 5LO was detected in CLP immunoprecipitates. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cross-linking experiments showed that 5LO binds CLP in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested an important role for lysine 131 of CLP in mediating 5LO binding. In view of the ability of CLP to bind 5LO and filamentous actin (F-actin), we determined whether CLP could physically link 5LO to actin filaments. However, no F-actin-CLP.5LO ternary complex was observed. In contrast, 5LO appeared to compete with F-actin for the binding of CLP. Moreover, 5LO was found to interfere with actin polymerization. Our results indicate that the 5LO-CLP and CLP-F-actin interactions are mutually exclusive and suggest a modulatory role for 5LO in actin dynamics.

heat shock transcription factor	HSF	The wing in yeast heat shock transcription factor (HSF) DNA-binding domain is required for full activity.
yeast heat shock transcription factor	HSF	The yeast heat shock transcription factor (HSF) belongs to the winged helix family of proteins. HSF binds DNA as a trimer, and additional trimers can bind DNA co-operatively. Unlike other winged helix-turn-helix proteins, HSF's wing does not appear to contact DNA, as based on a previously solved crystal structure. Instead, the structure implies that the wing is involved in protein-protein interactions, possibly within a trimer or between adjacent trimers. To understand the function of the wing in the HSF DNA-binding domain, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was created that expresses a wingless HSF protein. This strain grows normally at 30 degrees C, but shows a decrease in reporter gene expression during constitutive and heat-shocked conditions. Removal of the wing does not affect the stability or trimeric nature of a protein fragment containing the DNA-binding and trimerization domains. Removal of the wing does result in a decrease in DNA-binding affinity. This defect was mainly observed in the ability to form the first trimer-bound complex, as the formation of larger complexes is unaffected by the deletion. Our results suggest that the wing is not involved in the highly co-operative nature of HSF binding, but may be important in stabilizing the first trimer bound to DNA.
glutathione-S-transferase	GST	RAD54 is an important member of the RAD52 group of genes that carry out recombinational repair of DNA damage in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad54 protein is a member of the Snf2/Swi2 protein family of DNA-dependent/stimulated ATPases, and its ATPase activity is crucial for Rad54 protein function. Rad54 protein and Rad54-K341R, a mutant protein defective in the Walker A box ATP-binding fold, were fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and purified to near homogeneity. In vivo, GST-Rad54 protein carried out the functions required for methyl methanesulfonate sulfate (MMS), UV, and DSB repair. In vitro, GST-Rad54 protein exhibited dsDNA-specific ATPase activity. Rad54 protein stimulated Rad51/Rpa-mediated DNA strand exchange by specifically increasing the kinetics of joint molecule formation. This stimulation was accompanied by a concurrent increase in the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Our results suggest that Rad54 protein interacts specifically with established Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments before homology search on the duplex DNA and heteroduplex DNA formation. Rad54 protein did not stimulate DNA strand exchange by increasing presynaptic complex formation. We conclude that Rad54 protein acts during the synaptic phase of DNA strand exchange and after the formation of presynaptic Rad51 protein-ssDNA filaments. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.

Brassica S receptor kinase	SRK	The yeast two-hybrid system was used to further characterize the interactions between the Brassica S receptor kinase (SRK) and three putative substrates, ARC1 and the two thioredoxin h proteins, THL1 and THL2. Interactions were generally detectable with kinase domains of both Class I and Class II SRKs. Chimeric constructs were made between the SRK910 kinase domain and the non-interacting Arabidopsis RLK5 kinase domain. Only one chimeric construct, SRR2, interacted with THL1 and THL2, while none of the chimeras were able to interact with ARC1. SRR2 is largely made up of RLK5 kinase domain with the N-terminal end being derived from the SRK910 kinase domain and was the only chimeric construct that retained kinase activity. Deletion or substitution of a conserved cysteine at the N-terminal end of the SRK910 kinase domain resulted in loss of interaction with THL1 and THL2, while the addition of this cysteine to a related receptor kinase, SFR1, conferred the ability to interact with the thioredoxin h proteins. In addition, substitution of the cysteines in the THL1 active site abolished the interaction. Lastly, the two Arabidopsis thioredoxin h clones most closely related to THL1 and THL2 were found to interact with the SRK kinase domains. Thus, the nature of the interaction of the thioredoxin h clones with SRK involves the reducing activity of these proteins and is restricted to the class of thioredoxin h proteins which have the variant CPPC active site.
origin recognition complex	ORC	The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a six subunit complex required for eukaryotic DNA replication initiation and for silencing of the heterochromatic mating type loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our discovery of the Drosophila ORC complex concentrated in the centric heterochromatin of mitotic cells in the early embryo and its interactions with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP-1) lead us to speculate that ORC may play some general role in chromosomal folding. To explore the role of ORC in chromosomal condensation, we have identified a mutant of subunit 5 of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex (Orc5) and have characterized the phenotypes of both the Orc5 and the previously identified Orc2 mutant, k43. Both Orc mutants died at late larval stages and surprisingly, despite a reduced number of S-phase cells, an increased fraction of cells were also detected in mitosis. For this latter population of cells, Orc mutants arrest in a defective metaphase with shorter and thicker chromosomes that fail to align at the metaphase plate within a poorly assembled mitotic spindle. In addition, sister chromatid cohesion was frequently lost. PCNA and MCM4 mutants had similar phenotypes to Orc mutants. We propose that DNA replication defects trigger the mitotic arrest, due to the fact that frequent fragmentation was observed. Thus, cells have a mitotic checkpoint that senses chromosome integrity. These studies also suggest that the density of functional replication origins and completion of S phase are requirements for proper chromosomal condensation.

store-operated channels	SOCs	Agonist-receptor interactions at the plasma membrane often lead to activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane, allowing for sustained Ca(2+) influx. While Ca(2+) influx is important for many biological processes, little is known about the types of SOCs, the nature of the depletion signal, or how the SOCs are activated. We recently showed that in addition to the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, both Jurkat T cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells express novel store-operated nonselective cation channels that we termed Ca(2+) release-activated nonselective cation (CRANC) channels. Here we demonstrate that activation of both CRAC and CRANC channels is accelerated by a soluble Ca(2+) influx factor (CIF). In addition, CRANC channels in inside-out plasma membrane patches are directly activated upon exposure of their cytoplasmic side to highly purified CIF preparations. Furthermore, CRANC channels are also directly activated by diacylglycerol. These results strongly suggest that the Ca(2+) store-depletion signal is a diffusible molecule and that at least some SOCs may have dual activation mechanisms.

F-box proteins	FBPs	SCF ubiquitin ligases are composed of Skp1, Cdc53, Hrt1 and one member of a large family of substrate receptors known as F-box proteins (FBPs). Here we report the identification, using sequential rounds of epitope tagging, affinity purification and mass spectrometry, of 16 Skp1 and Cdc53-associated proteins in budding yeast, including all components of SCF, 9 FBPs, Yjr033 (Rav1) and Ydr202 (Rav2). Rav1, Rav2 and Skp1 form a complex that we have named 'regulator of the (H+)-ATPase of the vacuolar and endosomal membranes' (RAVE), which associates with the V1 domain of the vacuolar membrane (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are conserved throughout eukaryotes, and have been implicated in tumour metastasis and multidrug resistance, and here we show that RAVE promotes glucose-triggered assembly of the V-ATPase holoenzyme. Previous systematic genome-wide two-hybrid screens yielded 17 proteins that interact with Skp1 and Cdc53, only 3 of which overlap with those reported here. Thus, our results provide a distinct view of the interactions that link proteins into a comprehensive cellular network.
translin-associated factor X	Trax	Trax (translin-associated factor X), a primarily cytoplasmic protein, inhibits the binding of TB-RBP (translin) to RNA.
translin-associated factor X	Trax	Trax (Translin-associated factor X) has been shown to interact with TB-RBP/Translin by its coimmunoprecipitation and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we demonstrate that Trax is widely expressed, does not bind to DNA or RNA, but forms heterodimers with TB-RBP under reducing conditions. The heterodimer of TB-RBP and Trax inhibits TB-RBP binding to RNA, but enhances TB-RBP binding to specific single stranded DNA sequences. The in vitro interactions between TB-RBP and Trax are confirmed by similar interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. Cell fractionation and confocal microscope studies reveal that Trax is predominantly cytoplasmic. In contrast, TB-RBP is present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of transfected cells and uses a highly conserved nuclear export signal to exit nuclei. In addition to a leucine zipper, two basic domains in TB-RBP are essential for RNA binding, but only one of these domains is needed for DNA binding. Trax restores DNA binding to TB-RBP containing an altered form of this domain. These data suggest that Trax-TB.RBP interactions modulate the DNA- and RNA-binding activity of TB-RBP.
dimerization interface of the metastasis-associated protein S100A4	Mts1	The dimerization interface of the metastasis-associated protein S100A4 (Mts1): in vivo and in vitro studies.
gamma-SNAP associate factor-1)	Gaf-1	The role of alpha/beta-SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) in vesicular trafficking is well established; however, the function of the ubiquitously expressed gamma-SNAP remains unclear. To further characterize the cellular role of this enigmatic protein, a two-hybrid screen was used to identify new, gamma-SNAP-binding proteins and to uncover potentially novel functions for gamma-SNAP. One such SNAP-binding protein, termed Gaf-1 (gamma-SNAP associate factor-1) specifically binds gamma- but not alpha-SNAP. The full-length Gaf-1 (75 kDa) is ubiquitously expressed and is found stoichiometrically associated with gamma-SNAP in cellular extracts. This binding is distinct from other SNAP interactions since no alpha-SNAP or NSF coprecipitated with Gaf-1. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis show that Gaf-1 is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Only a fraction of gamma-SNAP was mitochondrial with the balance being either cytosolic or associated with other membrane fractions. GFP-gamma-SNAP and the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1 both show a reticular distribution in HEK-293 cells. This reticular structure colocalizes with Gaf-1 and mitochondria as well as with microtubules but not with other cytoskeletal elements. These data identify a class of gamma-SNAP interactions that is distinct from other members of the SNAP family and point to a potential role for gamma-SNAP in mitochondrial dynamics.
PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1	PDZ	Plasma membrane Ca2+-atpase isoforms 2b and 4b interact promiscuously and selectively with members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins.
plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase	PMCA	Spatial and temporal regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling depends on localized Ca(2+) microdomains containing the requisite molecular components for Ca(2+) influx, efflux, and signal transmission. Plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) isoforms of the "b" splice type contain predicted PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1) interaction domains. The COOH-terminal tail of PMCA2b isolated the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein SAP97/hDlg as a binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The related MAGUKs SAP90/PSD95, PSD93/chapsyn-110, SAP97, and SAP102 all bound to the COOH-terminal tail of PMCA4b, whereas only the first three bound to the tail of PMCA2b. Coimmunoprecipitations confirmed the interaction selectivity between PMCA4b and SAP102 as opposed to the promiscuity of PMCA2b and 4b in interacting with other SAPs. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the exclusive presence and colocalization of PMCA4b and SAP97 in the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. In hippocampal neurons, PMCA2b was abundant throughout the somatodendritic compartment and often extended into the neck and head of individual spines where it colocalized with SAP90/PSD95. These data show that PMCA "b" splice forms interact promiscuously but also with specificity with different members of the PSD95 family of SAPs. PMCA-SAP interactions may play a role in the recruitment and maintenance of the PMCA at specific membrane domains involved in local Ca(2+) regulation.

histone acetyltransferase	HAT	The ARABIDOPSIS CBF transcriptional activators bind to the CRT/DRE regulatory element present in the promoters of many cold-regulated genes and stimulate their transcription. Expression of the CBF1 proteins in yeast activates reporter genes carrying a minimal promoter with the CRT/DRE as an upstream regulatory element. Here we report that this ability of CBF1 is dependent upon the activities of three key components of the yeast Ada and SAGA complexes, namely the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Gcn5 and the transcriptional adaptor proteins Ada2 and Ada3. This result suggested that CBF1 might function through the action of similar complexes in ARABIDOPSIS In support of this hypothesis we found that ARABIDOPSIS has a homolog of the GCN5 gene and two homologs of ADA2, the first report of multiple ADA2 genes in an organism. The ARABIDOPSIS GCN5 protein has intrinsic HAT activity and can physically interact in vitro with both the ARABIDOPSIS ADA2a and ADA2b proteins. In addition, the CBF1 transcriptional activator can interact with the ARABIDOPSIS GCN5 and ADA2 proteins. We conclude that ARABIDOPSIS encodes HAT-containing adaptor complexes that are related to the Ada and SAGA complexes of yeast and propose that the CBF1 transcriptional activator functions through the action of one or more of these complexes.
preprotein translocase of the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane	TOM	The preprotein translocase of the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM) consists of the initial import receptors Tom70 and Tom20 and a approximately 400-kDa (400 K) general import pore (GIP) complex that includes the central receptor Tom22, the channel Tom40, and the three small Tom proteins Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5. We report that the GIP complex is a highly stable complex with an unusual resistance to urea and alkaline pH. Under mild conditions for mitochondrial lysis, the receptor Tom20, but not Tom70, is quantitatively associated with the GIP complex, forming a 500K to 600K TOM complex. A preprotein, stably arrested in the GIP complex, is released by urea but not high salt, indicating that ionic interactions are not essential for keeping the preprotein in the GIP complex. Under more stringent detergent conditions, however, Tom20 and all three small Tom proteins are released, while the preprotein remains in the GIP complex. Moreover, purified outer membrane vesicles devoid of translocase components of the intermembrane space and inner membrane efficiently accumulate the preprotein in the GIP complex. Together, Tom40 and Tom22 thus represent the functional core unit that stably holds accumulated preproteins. The GIP complex isolated from outer membranes exhibits characteristic TOM channel activity with two coupled conductance states, each corresponding to the activity of purified Tom40, suggesting that the complex contains two simultaneously active and coupled channel pores.

replication protein A	RPA	In mammalian cells, the core factors involved in the damage recognition and incision steps of DNA nucleotide excision repair are XPA, TFIIH complex, XPC-HR23B, replication protein A (RPA), XPG, and ERCC1-XPF. Many interactions between these components have been detected, using different physical methods, in human cells and for the homologous factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several human nucleotide excision repair (NER) complexes, including a high-molecular-mass repairosome complex, have been proposed. However, there have been no measurements of activity of any mammalian NER protein complex isolated under native conditions. In order to assess relative strengths of interactions between NER factors, we captured TFIIH from cell extracts with an anti-cdk7 antibody, retaining TFIIH in active form attached to magnetic beads. Coimmunoprecipitation of other NER proteins was then monitored functionally in a reconstituted repair system with purified proteins. We found that all detectable TFIIH in gently prepared human cell extracts was present in the intact nine-subunit form. There was no evidence for a repair complex that contained all of the NER components. At low ionic strength TFIIH could associate with functional amounts of each NER factor except RPA. At physiological ionic strength, TFIIH associated with significant amounts of XPC-HR23B and XPG but not other repair factors. The strongest interaction was between TFIIH and XPC-HR23B, indicating a coupled role of these proteins in early steps of repair. A panel of antibodies was used to estimate that there are on the order of 10(5) molecules of each core NER factor per HeLa cell.

surfactant proteins A	SP-A	Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) are members of the collectin family of calcium-dependent lectins and are important pulmonary host defense molecules. Human SP-A and SP-D and rat SP-D bind to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, but the ligand remains unidentified. To identify a fungal ligand for SP-A and/or SP-D, we examined the interactions of the proteins with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SP-D but not SP-A bound yeast cells, and EDTA inhibited the binding. SP-D also aggregated yeast cells and isolated yeast cell walls. Treating yeast cells to remove cell wall mannoprotein did not reduce SP-D binding, and SP-D failed to aggregate chitin. However, SP-D aggregated yeast glucan before and after treatment with a beta(1-->3)-glucanase, suggesting a specific interaction between the collectin and beta(1-->6)-glucan. In support of this idea, SP-D-induced yeast aggregation was strongly inhibited by pustulan [a beta(1-->6)-linked glucose homopolymer] but was not inhibited by laminarin [a beta(1-->3)-linked glucose homopolymer]. Additionally, pustulan but not laminarin strongly inhibited SP-D binding to A. fumigatus. The pustulan concentration for 50% inhibition of SP-D binding to A. fumigatus is 1.0 +/- 0.3 microM glucose equivalents. Finally, SP-D showed reduced binding to the beta(1-->6)-glucan-deficient kre6 yeast mutant. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that beta(1-->6)-glucan is an important fungal ligand for SP-D and that glycosidic bond patterns alone can determine if an extended carbohydrate polymer is recognized by SP-D.
RNA polymerase II	Pol II	Nucleotide excision repair is the major pathway responsible for removing UV-induced DNA damage, and is therefore essential for cell survival following exposure to UV radiation. In this report, we have assessed the contributions of some components of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription machinery to UV resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the gene encoding the Pol II elongation factor TFIIS (SII) resulted in enhanced UV sensitivity, but only in the absence of global genome repair dependent on the RAD7 and RAD16 genes, a result seen previously with deletions of RAD26 and RAD28, yeast homologs of the human Cockayne syndrome genes CSB and CSA, respectively. A RAD7/16-dependent reduction in survival after UV irradiation was also seen in the presence of mutations in RNA Pol II that confer a defect in its response to SII, as well as with other mutations which reside in regions of the largest subunit of Pol II not involved in SII interactions. Indeed, an increase in UV sensitivity was achieved by simply decreasing the steadystate level of RNA Pol II. Truncation of the C-terminal domain and other RNA Pol II mutations conferred sensitivity to the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea and induction of RNR1 and RNR2 mRNAs after UV irradiation was attenuated in these mutant cells. That UV sensitivity can be a consequence of mutations in the RNA Pol II machinery in yeast cells suggests that alterations in transcriptional programs could underlie some of the pathophysiological defects seen in the human disease Cockayne syndrome.
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor	SNARE	Sed5p is the only syntaxin family member required for protein transport through the yeast Golgi and it is known to bind up to nine other soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins in vivo. We describe in vitro binding experiments in which we identify ternary and quaternary Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes. The formation of SNARE complexes among these endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-localized proteins requires Sed5p and is syntaxin-selective. In addition, Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes form selectively and this selectivity is mediated by Sed5p-containing intermediates that discriminate among subsequent binding partners. Although many of these SNAREs have overlapping distributions in vivo, the SNAREs that form complexes with Sed5p in vitro reflect their functionally distinct locales. Although SNARE-SNARE interactions are promiscuous and a single SNARE protein is often found in more than one complex, both the biochemical as well as genetic analyses reported here suggest that this is not a result of nonselective direct substitution of one SNARE for another. Rather our data are consistent with the existence of multiple (perhaps parallel) trafficking pathways where Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes play overlapping and/or distinct functional roles.
C-terminal RNA binding domain	C-RBD	Fip1 is an essential component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polyadenylation machinery and the only protein known to interact directly with poly(A) polymerase (Pap1). Its association with Pap1 inhibits the extension of an oligo(A) primer by limiting access of the RNA substrate to the C-terminal RNA binding domain (C-RBD) of Pap1. We present here the identification of separate functional domains of Fip1. Amino acids 80 to 105 are required for binding to Pap1 and for the inhibition of Pap1 activity. This region is also essential for viability, suggesting that Fip1-mediated repression of Pap1 has a crucial physiological function. Amino acids 206 to 220 of Fip1 are needed for the interaction with the Yth1 subunit of the complex and for specific polyadenylation of the cleaved mRNA precursor. A third domain within amino acids 105 to 206 helps to limit RNA binding at the C-RBD of Pap1. Our data demonstrate that the C terminus of Fip1 is required to relieve the Fip1-mediated repression of Pap1 in specific polyadenylation. In the absence of this domain, Pap1 remains in an inhibited state. These findings show that Fip1 has a crucial regulatory function in the polyadenylation reaction by controlling the activity of poly(A) tail synthesis through multiple interactions within the polyadenylation complex.
Brome mosaic virus	BMV	Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, encodes two RNA replication factors. Membrane-associated 1a protein contains a helicase-like domain and RNA capping functions. 2a, which is targeted to membranes by 1a, contains a central polymerase-like domain. In the absence of 2a and RNA replication, 1a acts through an intergenic replication signal in BMV genomic RNA3 to stabilize RNA3 and induce RNA3 to associate with cellular membrane. Multiple results imply that 1a-induced RNA3 stabilization reflects interactions involved in recruiting RNA3 templates into replication. To determine if 1a had similar effects on another BMV RNA replication template, we constructed a plasmid expressing BMV genomic RNA2 in vivo. In vivo-expressed RNA2 templates were replicated upon expression of 1a and 2a. In the absence of 2a, 1a stabilized RNA2 and induced RNA2 to associate with membrane. Deletion analysis demonstrated that 1a-induced membrane association of RNA2 was mediated by sequences in the 5'-proximal third of RNA2. The RNA2 5' untranslated region was sufficient to confer 1a-induced membrane association on a nonviral RNA. However, sequences in the N-terminal region of the 2a open reading frame enhanced 1a responsiveness of RNA2 and a chimeric RNA. A 5'-terminal RNA2 stem-loop important for RNA2 replication was essential for 1a-induced membrane association of RNA2 and, like the 1a-responsive RNA3 intergenic region, contained a required box B motif corresponding to the TPsiC stem-loop of host tRNAs. The level of 1a-induced membrane association of various RNA2 mutants correlated well with their abilities to serve as replication templates. These results support and expand the conclusion that 1a-induced BMV RNA stabilization and membrane association reflect early, 1a-mediated steps in viral RNA replication.
the Cdc6 protein	Cdc6p	The Cdc6 protein (Cdc6p) has essential roles in regulating initiation of DNA replication. Cdc6p is recruited to origins of replication by the origin recognition complex (ORC) late in mitosis; Cdc6p in turn recruits minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins to form the pre-replicative complex. Cdc6p is thought to interact with one or more Mcm proteins but this point has not yet been demonstrated. In the present study we observed that Cdc6p interacted significantly only with Mcm2p out of six Mcm proteins in yeast two-hybrid cells. Our results indicate that the interaction of Cdc6p with Mcm2p is specific, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the interaction might not be direct. In attempts to identify domains of Cdc6p important for interaction with Mcm2p, we tested interactions of various deleted versions of Cdc6p with Mcm2p and also with Cdc4p, which was previously known to interact with Cdc6p. The portion of Cdc6p from amino acid residues 51 to 394 was able to interact with Mcm2p. During the course of the studies we also discovered a previously undetected Cdc4p interaction domain between residues 51 and 394. Interestingly, when all six putative Cdc28 phosphorylation sites in Cdc6p were changed to alanine, a 6-7-fold increase in binding to Mcm2p was observed. This result suggests that unphosphorylated Cdc6p has higher affinity than phosphorylated Cdc6p for Mcm2p; this might partly explain the previous observation that Cdc6p failed to load Mcm proteins on replication origins during S phase when the cyclin-dependent protein kinase was active, thus helping to prevent the reinitiation of activated replicons.

DNA-binding domain	Rap1p-DBD	The telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are structurally and functionally well characterized. Their telomeric DNA is packaged by the protein Rap1p (repressor activator protein 1). Rap1p is a multifunctional, sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein which, besides participating in the regulation of telomeres structure and length, is also involved in transcriptional regulation of genes essential for cell growth and in silencing. Whereas the long tracts of telomeric DNA repeats of higher eukaryotes are mostly organized in closely spaced canonical nucleosomal arrays, it has been proposed that the 300 base-pairs of S. cerevisiae telomeric DNA are organized in a large non-nucleosomal structure that has been called the telosome. Recently, nucleosomes have been found also in Tetrahymena thermophila telomeres, suggesting that, in general, telomere structural differences between lower and higher eukaryotes could be quantitative, rather than qualitative. Using an in vitro model system, we have addressed the question of whether Rap1p can form a stable ternary complex with nucleosomes containing telomeric binding sites, or competes with nucleosome core formation. The approach we have taken is to place a single Rap1p-binding site at different positions within a nucleosome core and then test the binding of Rap1p and its DNA-binding domain (Rap1p-DBD). We show here that both proteins are able to specifically recognize their nucleosomal binding site, but that binding is dependent on the location of the site within the nucleosome core structure. These results show that a ternary complex between a nucleosome and Rap1p is stable and could be a possible intermediate between telomeric nucleosomes and telosomes in the dynamics of S. cerevisiae telomere organization.
forkhead-associated	FHA	Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains are modular protein-protein interaction domains of approximately 130 amino acids present in numerous signalling proteins. FHA-domain-dependent protein interactions are regulated by phosphorylation of target proteins and FHA domains may be multifunctional phosphopeptide-recognition modules. FHA domains of the budding yeast cell-cycle checkpoint protein kinases Dun1p and Rad53p have been crystallized. Crystals of the Dun1-FHA domain exhibit the symmetry of the space group P6(1)22 or P6(5)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 127.3, c = 386.3 A; diffraction data have been collected to 3.1 A resolution on a synchrotron source. Crystals of the N-terminal FHA domain (FHA1) of Rad53p diffract to 4.0 A resolution on a laboratory X-ray source and have Laue-group symmetry 4/mmm, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 61.7, c = 104.3 A.
APETALA1	AP1	OsMADS1 is a MADS box gene controlling flower development in rice. In order to learn more about the function of OsMADS1, we searched for cellular proteins interacting with OsMADS1 employing the yeast two-hybrid system. Two novel proteins with MADS domains, which were named OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, were isolated from a rice cDNA library. OsMADS14 and -15 are highly homologous to the maize MADS box gene ZAP1 which is an orthologue of the floral homeotic gene APETALA1 (AP1). Interactions among the three MADS domain proteins were confirmed by in vitro experiments using GST-fused OsMADS1 expressed in Escherichia coli and in vitro translated proteins of OsMADS14 and -15. We determined which domains in OsMADS1, -14, and -15 were required for protein-protein interaction employing the two-hybrid system and pull-down experiments. While the K domain was essential for protein-protein interaction, a region preceded by the K domain augmented this interaction. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of OsMADS1 functioned as a transcriptional activation domain in yeast and mammalian cells, while, on the other hand, the C domains of OsMADS14 and -15 exhibited only very weak transcriptional activator functionality, if any at all.
SOS recruitment system	SRS	The SOS recruitment system (SRS), a recently developed method for detecting protein-protein interactions, provides an attractive alternative to identify biologically important protein interactions. In SRS, the protein-protein interactions take place in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus, as is the case in the conventional two-hybrid system. Although the SRS has overcome some of the disadvantages of the conventional two-hybrid system, it still has several problems and limitations. Here, we describe a new protocol for SRS library screening. A new combination of growth media to avoid the tedious step of replica plating greatly increases the number of independent colonies in a single library screening. Furthermore, we designed a pair of ras-specific primers and a one-step simple PCR to rule out the most abundant false positive, the mammalian ras cDNA, in SRS library screening.
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli	EPEC	Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) attaches intimately to mammalian cells via a bacterial outer membrane adhesion molecule, intimin, and its receptor in the host cell membrane, Tir. Tir is a bacterial protein translocated into the host cell membrane and tyrosine phosphorylated after insertion. Tir-intimin binding induces organized actin polymerization beneath the adherent bacteria, resulting in the formation of pedestal-like structures. A series of Tir deletion derivatives were constructed to analyse which Tir domains are involved in intimin binding. We have localized the intimin-binding domain (IBD) of Tir using a yeast two-hybrid system and a gel-overlay approach to a region of 109 amino acids that is predicted to be exposed on the surface of the plasma membrane. A truncated Tir protein lacking this domain was translocated to the host cell membrane and tyrosine phosphorylated, but failed to bind intimin or to induce either actin polymerization or Tir accumulation beneath the bacteria. These results indicate that only a small region of Tir is needed to bind intimin and support the predicted topology for Tir, with both N- and C-terminal regions in the mammalian cell cytosol. They also confirm that Tir-intimin interactions are needed for cytoskeletal organization. We have also identified N-terminal regions involved in Tir stability and Tir secretion to the media.

clathrin-coated vesicles	CCVs	A native immunoisolation procedure has been used to investigate the role of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) in the transport of vacuolar proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the prevacuolar/endosome compartments in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that Apl2p, one large subunit of the adaptor protein-1 complex, and Vps10p, the carboxypeptidase Y vacuolar protein receptor, are associated with clathrin molecules. Vps10p packaging in CCVs is reduced in pep12 Delta and vps34 Delta, two mutants that block Vps10p transport from the TGN to the endosome. However, Vps10p sorting is independent of Apl2p. Interestingly, a Vps10C(t) Delta p mutant lacking its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, the portion of the receptor responsible for carboxypeptidase Y sorting, is also coimmunoprecipitated with clathrin. Our results suggest that CCVs mediate Vps10p transport from the TGN to the endosome independent of direct interactions between Vps10p and clathrin coats. The Vps10p C-terminal domain appears to play a principal role in retrieval of Vps10p from the prevacuolar compartment rather than in sorting from the TGN.

RNA recognition motif	RRM	eIF3 binds to 40S ribosomal subunits and stimulates recruitment of Met-tRNAiMet and mRNA to the pre-initiation complex. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an ortholog of human eIF3 subunit p35, HCR1, whose interactions with yeast eIF3 are not well defined. We found that HCR1 has a dual function in translation initiation: it binds to, and stabilizes, the eIF3-eIF5- eIF1-eIF2 multifactor complex and is required for the normal level of 40S ribosomes. The RNA recognition motif (RRM) of eIF3 subunit PRT1 interacted simultaneously with HCR1 and with an internal domain of eIF3 subunit TIF32 that has sequence and functional similarity to HCR1. PRT1, HCR1 and TIF32 were also functionally linked by genetic suppressor analysis. We propose that HCR1 stabilizes or modulates interaction between TIF32 and the PRT1 RRM. Removal of the PRT1 RRM resulted in dissociation of TIF32, NIP1, HCR1 and eIF5 from eIF3 in vivo, and destroyed 40S ribosome binding by the residual PRT1-TIF34-TIF35 subcomplex. Hence, the PRT1 RRM is crucial for the integrity and ribosome-binding activity of eIF3.
adrenodoxin	Adx	We have constructed plasmids for yeast expression of the fusion protein pre-cytochrome P450scc--adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin (F2) and a variant of F2 with the yeast CoxIV targeting presequence. Mitochondria isolated from transformed yeast cells contained the F2 fusion protein at about 0.5% of total protein and showed cholesterol hydroxylase activity with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. The activity increased 17- or 25-fold when sonicated mitochondria were supplemented with an excess of purified P450scc or a mixture of adrenodoxin (Adx) and adrenodoxin reductase (AdxRed), respectively. These data suggest that, at least in yeast mitochondria, the interactions of the catalytic domains of P450scc, Adx, and AdxRed in the common polypeptide chain are restricted.

Enoyl-acyl carrier protein	ACP	We have used a yeast two-hybrid approach to detect direct protein interactions between fatty acid synthase components. Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase was found to interact with stearoyl-ACP desaturase and acyl-ACP thioesterase, but none of these proteins interacted with ACP in the yeast nucleus.
origin recognition complex	ORC	BACKGROUND: MCM10 is essential for the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous work showed that Mcm10p interacts with the Mcm2-7 protein complex that may be functioning as the replication-licensing factor. In addition, Mcm10p is required during origin activation and disassembly of the prereplicative complex, which allows smooth passage of replication forks. RESULTS: We show that an mcm10 mutation causes a slow progression of DNA synthesis and a loss of chromosome integrity during the S phase and prevents entry into mitosis, despite apparent completion of chromosomal DNA replication at nonpermissive temperatures. Furthermore, Mcm10p interacts genetically with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and various replication elongation factors, including a subunit of DNA polymerases epsilon and delta. Mcm10p is an abundant protein (approximately 4 x 10(4) copies per haploid cell) that is almost exclusively localized in the chromatin and/or nuclear matrix fractions during all phases of the cell cycle. When it is visualized by the chromosome-spreading method followed by immunostaining, Mcm10p forms punctate foci on chromatin throughout the cell cycle and these foci mostly overlap with those of Orc1p, a component of ORC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Mcm10p, like the Mcm2-7 proteins, is a critical component of the prereplication chromatin and acts together with ORC during the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication; in addition, Mcm10p plays an important role during the elongation of DNA replication.
reverse Ras recruitment system	reverse RRS	Protein-protein interaction plays a major role in all biological processes. The currently available genetic methods such as the two-hybrid system and the protein recruitment system are relatively limited in their ability to identify interactions with integral membrane proteins. Here we describe the development of a reverse Ras recruitment system (reverse RRS), in which the bait used encodes a membrane protein. The bait is expressed in its natural environment, the membrane, whereas the protein partner (the prey) is fused to a cytoplasmic Ras mutant. Protein-protein interaction between the proteins encoded by the prey and the bait results in Ras membrane translocation and activation of a viability pathway in yeast. We devised the expression of the bait and prey proteins under the control of dual distinct inducible promoters, thus enabling a rapid selection of transformants in which growth is attributed solely to specific protein-protein interaction. The reverse RRS approach greatly extends the usefulness of the protein recruitment systems and the use of integral membrane proteins as baits. The system serves as an attractive approach to explore novel protein-protein interactions with high specificity and selectivity, where other methods fail.
glutathione S:-transferase	GST	We cloned cDNA encoding chicken cytoplasmic histone acetyltransferase-1, chHAT-1, comprising 408 amino acids including a putative initiation Met. It exhibits 80.4% identity to the human homolog and possesses a typical leucine zipper motif. The glutathione S:-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, involving truncated and missense mutants of the chicken chromatin assembly factor-1 (chCAF-1)p48, revealed not only that a region (comprising amino acids 376-405 of chCAF-1p48 and containing the seventh WD dipeptide motif) binds to chHAT-1 in vitro, but also that mutation of the motif has no influence on the in vitro interaction. The GST pull-down assay, involving truncated and missense chHAT-1 mutants, established that a region, comprising amino acids 380-408 of chHAT-1 and containing the leucine zipper motif, is required for its in vitro interaction with chCAF-1p48. In addition, mutation of each of four Leu residues in the leucine zipper motif prevents the in vitro interaction. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that all four Leu residues within the leucine zipper motif of chHAT-1 are necessary for its in vivo interaction with chCAF-1p48. These results indicate not only that the proper leucine zipper motif of chHAT-1 is essential for its interaction with chCAF-1p48, but also that the propeller structure of chCAF-1p48 expected to act as a platform for protein-protein interactions may not be necessary for this interaction of chHAT-1.
alkaline phosphatase	ALP	Transport of proteins through the ALP (alkaline phosphatase) pathway to the vacuole requires the function of the AP-3 adaptor complex and Vps41p. However, unlike other adaptor protein-dependent pathways, the ALP pathway has not been shown to require additional accessory proteins or coat proteins, such as membrane recruitment factors or clathrin. Two independent genetic approaches have been used to identify new mutants that affect transport through the ALP pathway. These screens yielded new mutants in both VPS41 and the four AP-3 subunit genes. Two new VPS41 alleles exhibited phenotypes distinct from null mutants of VPS41, which are defective in vacuolar morphology and protein transport through both the ALP and CPY sorting pathways. The new alleles displayed severe ALP sorting defects, normal vacuolar morphology, and defects in ALP vesicle formation at the Golgi complex. Sequencing analysis of these VPS41 alleles revealed mutations encoding amino acid changes in two distinct domains of Vps41p: a conserved N-terminal domain and a C-terminal clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domain. We demonstrate that the N-terminus of Vps41p is required for binding to AP-3, whereas the C-terminal CHCR domain directs homo-oligomerization of Vps41p. These data indicate that a homo-oligomeric form of Vps41p is required for the formation of ALP containing vesicles at the Golgi complex via interactions with AP-3.
C-terminal clathrin heavy-chain repeat	CHCR	Transport of proteins through the ALP (alkaline phosphatase) pathway to the vacuole requires the function of the AP-3 adaptor complex and Vps41p. However, unlike other adaptor protein-dependent pathways, the ALP pathway has not been shown to require additional accessory proteins or coat proteins, such as membrane recruitment factors or clathrin.

Sequencing analysis of these VPS41 alleles revealed mutations encoding amino acid changes in two distinct domains of Vps41p: a conserved N-terminal domain and a C-terminal clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domain. We demonstrate that the N-terminus of Vps41p is required for binding to AP-3, whereas the C-terminal CHCR domain directs homo-oligomerization of Vps41p. These data indicate that a homo-oligomeric form of Vps41p is required for the formation of ALP containing vesicles at the Golgi complex via interactions with AP-3.
nucleotide-binding domains	NBD	Point mutations in either of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) of Hsp104 (NBD1 and NBD2) eliminate its thermotolerance function in vivo. In vitro, NBD1 mutations virtually eliminate ATP hydrolysis with little effect on hexamerization; analogous NBD2 mutations reduce ATPase activity and severely impair hexamerization. We report that high protein concentrations overcome the assembly defects of NBD2 mutants and increase ATP hydrolysis severalfold, changing V(max) with little effect on K(m). In a complementary fashion, the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate inhibits hexamerization of wild-type (WT) Hsp104, lowering V(max) with little effect on K(m). ATP hydrolysis exhibits a Hill coefficient between 1.5 and 2, indicating that it is influenced by cooperative subunit interactions. To further analyze the effects of subunit interactions on Hsp104, we assessed the effects of mutant Hsp104 proteins on WT Hsp104 activities. An NBD1 mutant that hexamerizes but does not hydrolyze ATP reduces the ATPase activity of WT Hsp104 in vitro. In vivo, this mutant is not toxic but specifically inhibits the thermotolerance function of WT Hsp104. Thus, interactions between subunits influence the ATPase activity of Hsp104, play a vital role in its biological functions, and provide a mechanism for conditionally inactivating Hsp104 function in vivo.

ATP hydrolysis exhibits a Hill coefficient between 1.5 and 2, indicating that it is influenced by cooperative subunit interactions. To further analyze the effects of subunit interactions on Hsp104, we assessed the effects of mutant Hsp104 proteins on WT Hsp104 activities. An NBD1 mutant that hexamerizes but does not hydrolyze ATP reduces the ATPase activity of WT Hsp104 in vitro. In vivo, this mutant is not toxic but specifically inhibits the thermotolerance function of WT Hsp104. Thus, interactions between subunits influence the ATPase activity of Hsp104, play a vital role in its biological functions, and provide a mechanism for conditionally inactivating Hsp104 function in vivo.
nuclear factor kappaB	NFkappaB	ASC-2 is a recently isolated transcriptional cointegrator molecule, which is amplified in human cancers and stimulates transactivation by nuclear receptors, AP-1, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), serum response factor (SRF), and numerous other transcription factors. ASC-2 contained two nuclear receptor-interaction domains, both of which are dependent on the integrity of their core LXXLL sequences. Surprisingly, the C-terminal LXXLL motif specifically interacted with oxysterol receptor LXRss, whereas the N-terminal motif bound a broad range of nuclear receptors. These interactions appeared to be essential because a specific subregion of ASC-2 including the N- or C-terminal LXXLL motif acted as a potent dominant negative mutant with transactivation by appropriate nuclear receptors. In addition, the autonomous transactivation domain (AD) of ASC-2 was found to consist of three separable subregions; i.e. AD1, AD2, and AD3. In particular, AD2 and AD3 were binding sites for CREB binding protein (CBP), and CBP-neutralizing E1A repressed the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2. Furthermore, the receptor transactivation was not enhanced by ASC-2 in the presence of E1A and significantly impaired by overexpressed AD2. From these results, we concluded that ASC-2 directly binds to nuclear receptors and recruits CBP to mediate the nuclear receptor transactivation in vivo.

COOH-terminal domain	Cdc5	Coordination of mitotic exit with timely initiation of cytokinesis is critical to ensure completion of mitotic events before cell division. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase Cdc5 functions in a pathway leading to the degradation of mitotic cyclin Clb2, thereby permitting mitotic exit. Here we provide evidence that Cdc5 also plays a role in regulating cytokinesis and that an intact polo-box, a conserved motif in the noncatalytic COOH-terminal domain of Cdc5, is required for this event. Depletion of Cdc5 function leads to an arrest in cytokinesis. Overexpression of the COOH-terminal domain of Cdc5 (cdc5DeltaN), but not the corresponding polo-box mutant, resulted in connected cells. These cells shared cytoplasms with incomplete septa, and possessed aberrant septin ring structures. Provision of additional copies of endogenous CDC5 remedied this phenotype, suggesting a dominant-negative inhibition of cytokinesis. The polo-box-dependent interactions between Cdc5 and septins (Cdc11 and Cdc12) and genetic interactions between the dominant-negative cdc5DeltaN and Cyk2/Hof1 or Myo1 suggest that direct interactions between cdc5DeltaN and septins resulted in inhibition of Cyk2/Hof1- and Myo1-mediated cytokinetic pathways. Thus, we propose that Cdc5 may coordinate mitotic exit with cytokinesis by participating in both anaphase promoting complex activation and a polo-box-dependent cytokinetic pathway.
Fanconi anaemia	FA	Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder associated with a progressive aplastic anaemia, diverse congenital abnormalities and cancer. The condition is genetically heterogeneous, with at least seven complementation groups (A-G) described. Cells from individuals who are homozygous for mutations in FA genes are characterized by chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. These features suggest a possible role for the encoded proteins in the recognition or repair of these lesions, but neither their function nor whether they operate in a concerted or discrete functional pathways is known. The recent cloning of the FANCF and FANCE genes has allowed us to investigate the interaction of the proteins encoded by five of the seven complementation groups of FA. We used the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation analysis to test the 10 possible pairs of proteins for direct interaction. In addition to the previously described binding of FANCA to FANCG, we now demonstrate direct interaction of FANCF with FANCG, of FANCC with FANCE and a weaker interaction of FANCE with both FANCA and FANCG. These findings show that the newly identified FANCE protein is an integral part of the FA pathway, and support the concept of a functional link between all known proteins encoded by the genes that are mutated in this disorder. These proteins may act either as a multimeric complex or by sequential recruitment of subsets of the proteins in a common pathway that protects the genomic integrity of mammalian cells.
origin recognition complex	ORC	Silencing of the cryptic mating-type locus HMR requires recognition of a small DNA sequence element, the HMR-E silencer, by the Sir1p, one of four Sir proteins required for the assembly of silenced chromatin domains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Sir1p recognizes the silencer through interactions with the origin recognition complex (ORC), a protein complex that binds the silencer DNA directly. Sir1p was physically associated with HMR in chromatin, and this association required a Sir1p-ORC interaction, suggesting that it reflected the Sir1p silencer-recognition function required for silencing. Sir1p was not associated with nonsilencer replication origins that bind the ORC, indicating that a Sir1p-ORC interaction is confined to silencers. Significantly, the other SIR genes were required for Sir1p's association with HMR. Thus, multiple protein contacts required for and unique to silent chromatin may confine a Sir1p-ORC interaction to silencers. The Sir1p was present at extremely low concentrations in yeast cells yet was associated with HMR at all stages of the cell cycle examined. These data provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and restrict the assembly of silenced chromatin to only a few discrete chromosomal domains.
vacuole targeting	Cvt	Autophagy is a degradative pathway by which cells sequester nonessential, bulk cytosol into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) and deliver them to the vacuole for recycling. Using this strategy, eukaryotic cells survive periods of nutritional starvation. Under nutrient-rich conditions, autophagy machinery is required for the delivery of a resident vacuolar hydrolase, aminopeptidase I, by the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. In both pathways, the vesicle formation process requires the function of the starvation-induced Aut7 protein, which is recruited from the cytosol to the forming Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. The membrane binding of Aut7p represents an early step in vesicle formation. In this study, we identify several requirements for Aut7p membrane association. After synthesis in the cytosol, Aut7p is proteolytically cleaved in an Aut2p-dependent manner. While this novel processing event is essential for Aut7p membrane binding, Aut7p must undergo additional physical interactions with Aut1p and the autophagy (Apg) conjugation complex before recruitment to the membrane. Lack of these interactions results in a cytosolic distribution of Aut7p rather than localization to forming Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. This study assigns a functional role for the Apg conjugation system as a mediator of Aut7p membrane recruitment. Further, we demonstrate that Aut1p, which physically interacts with components of the Apg conjugation complex and Aut7p, constitutes an additional factor required for Aut7p membrane recruitment. These findings define a series of steps that results in the modification of Aut7p and its subsequent binding to the sequestering transport vesicles of the autophagy and cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathways.

regulator protein Cnr	Cnr	DNA replication of phage-plasmid P4 in its host Escherichia coli depends on its replication protein alpha. In the plasmid state, P4 copy number is controlled by the regulator protein Cnr (copy number regulation). Mutations in alpha (alpha(cr)) that prevent regulation by Cnr cause P4 over-replication and cell death. Using the two-hybrid system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a system based on lambda immunity in E.coli for in vivo detection of protein-protein interactions, we found that (i) alpha protein interacts with Cnr, whereas alpha(cr) proteins do not; (ii) both alpha-alpha and alpha(cr)-alpha(cr) interactions occur and the interaction domain is located within the C-terminal of alpha; (iii) Cnr-Cnr interaction also occurs. Using an in vivo competition assay, we found that Cnr interferes with both alpha-alpha and alpha(cr)-alpha(cr) dimerization. Our data suggest that Cnr and alpha interact in at least two ways, which may have different functional roles in P4 replication control.

Replication factor C	RFC	Replication factor C (RFC) is an essential, multi-subunit ATPase that functions in DNA replication, DNA repair, and DNA metabolism-related checkpoints. In order to investigate how the individual RFC subunits contribute to these functions in vivo, we undertook a genetic analysis of RFC genes from budding yeast. We isolated and characterized mutations in the RFC5 gene that could suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype of rfc1-1 mutants. Analysis of the RFC5 suppressors revealed that they could not suppress the elongated telomere phenotype, the sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, or the mutator phenotype of rfc1-1 mutants. Unlike the checkpoint-defective rfc5-1 mutation, the RFC5 suppressor mutations did not interfere with the methylmethane sulfonate- or hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of Rad53p. The Rfc5p suppressor substitutions mapped to amino acid positions in the conserved RFC box motifs IV-VII. Comparisons of the structures of related RFC box-containing proteins suggest that these RFC motifs may function to coordinate interactions between neighboring subunits of multi-subunit ATPases.
Cytochrome c	Cc	Cytochrome c (Cc) binding to apoptosis protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) is a critical activation step in the execution phase of apoptosis. Here we report studies that help define the Cc:Apaf-1 binding surface. It is shown that a large number of Cc residues, including residues 7, 25, 39, 62-65, and 72, are involved in the Cc:Apaf-1 interaction. Mutation of residue 72 eliminated Cc activity whereas mutations of residues 7, 25, 39, and 62-65 showed reduced activity in an additive fashion. The implications of this binding model for both recognition and modulation of protein-protein interactions are briefly discussed.

forkhead-associated	FHA	Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains have been shown to recognize both pThr and pTyr-peptides. The solution structures of the FHA2 domain of Rad53 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its complex with a pTyr peptide, have been reported recently. We now report the solution structure of the other FHA domain of Rad53, FHA1 (residues 14-164), and identification of binding sites of FHA1 and its target protein Rad9. The FHA1 structure consists of 11 beta-strands, which form two large twisted anti-parallel beta-sheets folding into a beta-sandwich. Three short alpha-helices were also identified. The beta-strands are linked by several loops and turns. These structural features of free FHA1 are similar to those of free FHA2, but there are significant differences in the loops. Screening of a peptide library [XXX(pT)XXX] against FHA1 revealed an absolute requirement for Asp at the +3 position and a preference for Ala at the +2 position. These two criteria are met by a pThr motif (192)TEAD(195) in Rad9. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that a pThr peptide containing this motif, (188)SLEV(pT)EADATFVQ(200) from Rad9, binds to FHA1 with a K(d) value of 0.36 microM. Other peptides containing pTXXD sequences also bound to FHA1, but less tightly (K(d)=4-70 microM). These results suggest that Thr192 of Rad9 is the likely phosphorylation site recognized by the FHA1 domain of Rad53. The tight-binding peptide was then used to identify residues of FHA1 involved in the interaction with the pThr peptide. The results are compared with the interactions between the FHA2 domain and a pTyr peptide derived from Rad9 reported previously. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
mitogen-activated protein kinase	MAPK	Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to mating pheromones by activating a receptor-G-protein-coupled mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that is also used by other signaling pathways. The activation of the MAPK cascade may involve conformational changes through prebound receptor and heterotrimeric G-protein. G beta may then recruit Cdc42-bound MAPKKKK Ste20 to MAPKKK Ste11 through direct interactions with Ste20 and the Ste5 scaffold. Ste20 activates Ste11 by derepressing an autoinhibitory domain. An underlying nuclear shuttling machinery may be required for proper recruitment of Ste5 to G beta. Subsequent polarized growth is mediated by a similar mechanism involving Far1, which binds G beta in addition to Cdc24 and Bem1. Far1 and Cdc24 also undergo nuclear shuttling and the nuclear pool of Far1 may temporally regulate access of Cdc24 to the cell cortex.
spindle pole body	SPB	A rate-limiting step during translation initiation in eukaryotic cells involves binding of the initiation factor eIF4E to the 7-methylguanosine-containing cap of mRNAs. Overexpression of eIF4E leads to malignant transformation [1-3], and eIF4E is elevated in many human cancers [4-7]. In mammalian cells, three eIF4E-binding proteins each interact with eIF4E and inhibit its function [8-10]. In yeast, EAP1 encodes a protein that binds eIF4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation in vitro [11]. A point mutation in the canonical eIF4E-binding motif of Eap1p blocks its interaction with eIF4E [11]. Here, we characterized the genetic interactions between EAP1 and NDC1, a gene whose function is required for duplication of the spindle pole body (SPB) [12], the centrosome-equivalent organelle in yeast that functions as the centrosome. We found that the deletion of EAP1 is lethal when combined with the ndc1-1 mutation. Mutations in NDC1 or altered NDC1 gene dosage lead to genetic instability [13,14]. Yeast strains lacking EAP1 also exhibit genetic instability. We tested whether these phenotypes are due to loss of EAP1 function in regulating translation. We found that both the synthetic lethal phenotype and the genetic instability phenotypes are rescued by a mutant allele of EAP1 that is unable to bind eIF4E. Our findings suggest that Eap1p carries out an eIF4E-independent function to maintain genetic stability, most likely involving SPBs.
mytone enhancer factor-2	MEF2	Skeletal muscle differentiation is controlled by interactions between myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) and myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Association of MEF2 with histone deacetylases (HDAC) -4 and -5 results in repression of MEF2 target genes and inhibition of myogenesis. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signaling promotes myogenesis by disrupting MEF2-HDAC complexes and stimulating HDAC nuclear export. To further define the mechanisms that confer CaMK responsiveness to HDAC4 and -5, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify HDAC-interacting factors. These screens revealed interactions between HDAC4 and members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which function as signal-dependent intracellular chaperones. HDAC4 binds constitutively to 14-3-3 in yeast and mammalian cells, whereas HDAC5 binding to 14-3-3 is largely dependent on CaMK signaling. CaMK phosphorylates serines -259 and -498 in HDAC5, which subsequently serve as docking sites for 14-3-3. Our studies suggest that 14-3-3 binding to HDAC5 is required for CaMK-dependent disruption of MEF2-HDAC complexes and nuclear export of HDAC5, and implicate 14-3-3 as a signal-dependent regulator of muscle cell differentiation.

nonsense-mediated mRNA decay	NMD	Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), also called mRNA surveillance, is an important pathway used by all organisms that have been tested to degrade mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation and, as a consequence, eliminate the production of aberrant proteins that could be potentially harmful. In mammalian cells, NMD appears to involve splicing-dependent alterations to mRNA as well as ribosome-associated components of the translational apparatus. To date, human (h) Upf1 protein (p) (hUpf1p), a group 1 RNA helicase named after its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue that functions in both translation termination and NMD, has been the only factor shown to be required for NMD in mammalian cells. Here, we describe human orthologues to S. cerevisiae Upf2p and S. cerevisiae Upf3p (Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4) based on limited amino acid similarities. The existence of these orthologues provides evidence for a higher degree of evolutionary conservation of NMD than previously appreciated. Interestingly, human orthologues to S. cerevisiae Upf3p (C. elegans SMG-4) derive from two genes, one of which is X-linked and both of which generate multiple isoforms due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We demonstrate using immunoprecipitations of epitope-tagged proteins transiently produced in HeLa cells that hUpf2p interacts with hUpf1p, hUpf3p-X, and hUpf3p, and we define the domains required for the interactions. Furthermore, we find by using indirect immunofluorescence that hUpf1p is detected only in the cytoplasm, hUpf2p is detected primarily in the cytoplasm, and hUpf3p-X localizes primarily to nuclei. The finding that hUpf3p-X is a shuttling protein provides additional indication that NMD has both nuclear and cytoplasmic components.

delta(24)-sterol methyl transferase	SMT	Sterol C-methylations catalyzed by the (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine: Delta(24)-sterol methyl transferase (SMT) have provided the focus for study of electrophilic alkylations, a reaction type of functional importance in C-C bond formation of natural products. SMTs occur generally in nature, but do not occur in animal systems, suggesting that the difference in sterol synthetic pathways can be exploited therapeutically and in insect-plant interactions. The SMT genes from several plants and fungi have been cloned, sequenced and expressed in bacteria or yeast and bioengineered into tobacco or tomato plants. These enzymes share significant amino acid sequence similarity in the putative sterol and AdoMet binding sites. Investigations of the molecular recognition of sterol fitness and studies with stereospecifically labeled substrates as well as various sterol analogs assayed with native or mutant SMTs from fungi and plants have been carried out recently in our own and other laboratories. These analyses have led to an active-site model, referred to as the 'steric-electric plug' model, which is consistent with a non-covalent mechanism involving the intermediacy of a 24beta-methyl (or ethyl) sterol bound to the ternary complex. Despite the seeming differences between fungal and plant SMT activities the recent data indicate that a distinct SMT or family of SMTs exist in these organisms which bind and transform sterols according to a similar mechanistic plan. Vascular plants have been found to express different complements of C(1)/C(2)-activities in the form of at least three SMT isoforms. This enzyme multiplicity can be a target of regulatory control to affect phytosterol homeostasis in transgenic plants. The state of our current understanding of SMT enzymology and inhibition is presented.
forkhead-associated	FHA	Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains are a class of ubiquitous signaling modules that appear to function through interactions with phosphorylated target molecules. We have used oriented peptide library screening to determine the optimal phosphopeptide binding motifs recognized by several FHA domains, including those within a number of DNA damage checkpoint kinases, and determined the X-ray structure of Rad53p-FHA1, in complex with a phospho-threonine peptide, at 1.6 A resolution. The structure reveals a striking similarity to the MH2 domains of Smad tumor suppressor proteins and reveals a mode of peptide binding that differs from SH2, 14-3-3, or PTB domain complexes. These results have important implications for DNA damage signaling and CHK2-dependent tumor suppression, and they indicate that FHA domains play important and unsuspected roles in S/T kinase signaling mechanisms in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
tetratricopeptide repeat	TPR	The PRP17/CDC40 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions in two different cellular processes: pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle progression. The Prp17/Cdc40 protein participates in the second step of the splicing reaction and, in addition, prp17/cdc40 mutant cells held at the restrictive temperature arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Here we describe the identification of nine genes that, when mutated, show synthetic lethality with the prp17/cdc40Delta allele. Six of these encode known splicing factors: Prp8p, Slu7p, Prp16p, Prp22p, Slt11p, and U2 snRNA. The other three, SYF1, SYF2, and SYF3, represent genes also involved in cell cycle progression and in pre-mRNA splicing. Syf1p and Syf3p are highly conserved proteins containing several copies of a repeated motif, which we term RTPR. This newly defined motif is shared by proteins involved in RNA processing and represents a subfamily of the known TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motif. Using two-hybrid interaction screens and biochemical analysis, we show that the SYF gene products interact with each other and with four other proteins: Isy1p, Cef1p, Prp22p, and Ntc20p. We discuss the role played by these proteins in splicing and cell cycle progression.
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A	eIF4A	The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) is a member of the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family, a diverse group of proteins that couples an ATPase activity to RNA binding and unwinding. Previous work has provided the structure of the amino-terminal, ATP-binding domain of eIF4A. Extending those results, we have solved the structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4A with data to 1.75 A resolution; it has a parallel alpha-beta topology that superimposes, with minor variations, on the structures and conserved motifs of the equivalent domain in other, distantly related helicases. Using data to 2.8 A resolution and molecular replacement with the refined model of the carboxyl-terminal domain, we have completed the structure of full-length eIF4A; it is a "dumbbell" structure consisting of two compact domains connected by an extended linker. By using the structures of other helicases as a template, compact structures can be modeled for eIF4A that suggest (i) helicase motif IV binds RNA; (ii) Arg-298, which is conserved in the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family but is absent from many other helicases, also binds RNA; and (iii) motifs V and VI "link" the carboxyl-terminal domain to the amino-terminal domain through interactions with ATP and the DEA(D/H) motif, providing a mechanism for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes that modulate RNA binding.
ubiquitin associated domains	UBA	The DNA repair protein HHR23A is a highly conserved protein that functions in nucleotide excision repair. HHR23A contains two ubiquitin associated domains (UBA) that are conserved in a number of proteins with diverse functions involved in ubiquitination, UV excision repair, and signaling pathways via protein kinases. The cellular binding partners of UBA domains remain unclear; however, we previously found that the HHR23A UBA(2) domain interacts specifically with the HIV-1 Vpr protein. Analysis of the low resolution solution structure of HHR23A UBA(2) revealed a hydrophobic loop region of the UBA(2) domain that we predicted was the interface for protein/protein interactions. Here we present results of in vitro binding studies that demonstrate the requirement of this hydrophobic loop region for interaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Vpr. A single point mutation of the Pro at residue 333 to a Glu totally abolishes the binding of HIV-1 Vpr to UBA(2). High resolution NMR structures of the binding deficient UBA(2) mutant P333E as well as of the wild-type UBA(2) domain were determined to compare the effect of this mutation on the structure. Small but significant differences are observed only locally at the site of the mutation. The biochemical and structural analysis confirms the function of the HHR23A UBA(2) GFP-loop as the protein/protein interacting domain.
green fluorescent protein	EGFP	We describe a new method with general applicability for monitoring any protein-protein interaction in vivo. The principle is based on a protein splicing system, which involves a self-catalyzed excision of protein splicing elements, or inteins, from flanking polypeptide sequences, or exteins, leading to formation of a new protein in which the exteins are linked directly by a peptide bond. As the exteins, split N- and C-terminal halves of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used. When a single peptide consisting of an intein derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae intervening the split EGFP was expressed in Escherichia coli, the two external regions of EGFP were ligated, thereby forming the EGFP corresponding fluorophore. Genetic alteration of the intein, which involved large deletion of the central region encoding 104 amino acids, was performed. In the expression of the residual N- and C-terminal intein fragments each fused to the split EGFP exteins, the splicing in trans did not proceed. However, upon coexpression of calmodulin and its target peptide M13, each connected to the N- and C-terminal inteins, fluorescence of EGFP was observed. These results demonstrate that interaction of calmodulin and M13 triggers the refolding of intein, which induces the protein splicing, thereby folding the ligated extein correctly for yielding the EGFP fluorophore. This method opens a new way not only to screen protein-protein interactions but also to visualize the interaction in vivo in transgenic animals.
mRNA decay	NMD	Transcripts harboring premature signals for translation termination are recognized and rapidly degraded by eukaryotic cells through a pathway known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In addition to protecting cells by preventing the translation of potentially deleterious truncated peptides, studies have suggested that NMD plays a broader role in the regulation of the steady-state levels of physiologic transcripts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three trans-acting factors (Upf1p to Upf3p) are required for NMD. Orthologues of Upf1p have been identified in numerous species, showing that the NMD machinery, at least in part, is conserved through evolution. In this study, we demonstrate additional functional conservation of the NMD pathway through the identification of Upf2p homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and humans (rent2). Disruption of S. pombe UPF2 established that this gene is required for NMD in fission yeast. rent2 was demonstrated to interact directly with rent1, a known trans-effector of NMD in mammalian cells. Additionally, fragments of rent2 were shown to possess nuclear targeting activity, although the native protein localizes to the cytoplasmic compartment. Finally, novel functional domains of Upf2p and rent2 with homology to eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and other translational regulatory proteins were identified. Directed mutations within these so-called eIF4G homology (4GH) domains were sufficient to abolish the function of S. pombe Upf2p. Furthermore, using the two-hybrid system, we obtained evidence for direct interaction between rent2 and human eIF4AI and Sui1, both components of the translation initiation complex. Based on these findings, a novel model in which Upf2p and rent2 effects decreased translation and accelerated decay of nonsense transcripts through competitive interactions with eIF4G-binding partners is proposed.

type III secretion system	TTSS	A wide variety of gram-negative bacteria utilize a specialized apparatus called the type III secretion system (TTSS) to translocate virulence factors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. These translocated effectors contribute to the pathogen's ability to infect and replicate within plant and animal hosts. The amino terminus of effector proteins contains sequences that are necessary and sufficient for both secretion and translocation by TTSS. Portions of these sequences contain binding sites for type III chaperones, which facilitate efficient secretion and translocation of specific effectors through TTSS. In this study, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify protein-protein interactions between effector and chaperone proteins encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1). Several interactions were identified including a novel interaction between the effector protein, SspA (SipA), and a putative chaperone, InvB. InvB was demonstrated to bind to the amino terminus of SspA in the bacterial cytoplasm. Furthermore, InvB acts as a type III chaperone for the efficient secretion and translocation of SspA by SPI-1. InvB also permitted translocation of SspA through the SPI-2 TTSS, indicating that it is an important regulator in the recognition of SspA as a target of TTSS. Finally, it was determined that InvB does not alter the transcription of sspA but that its absence results in reduced SspA protein levels in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

helix-loop-helix	bHLH	The Ino4 protein belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of proteins. It is known to form a dimer with Ino2p, which regulates phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Mammalian bHLH proteins have been shown to form multiple dimer combinations. However, this flexibility in dimerization had not been documented for yeast bHLH proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and a biochemical assay we show that Ino4p dimerizes with the Pho4p, Rtg1p, Rtg3p and Sgc1p bHLH proteins. Screening a yeast cDNA library identified three additional proteins that interact with Ino4p: Bck2p, YLR422W and YNR064C. The interaction with Bck2p prompted us to examine if any of the Bck2p-associated functions affect expression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. We found that hyperosmotic growth conditions altered the growth phase regulation of a phospholipid biosynthetic gene, CHO1. There are two recent reports of initial whole genome yeast two-hybrid interactions. Interestingly, one of these reports identified five proteins that interact with Ino4p: Ino2p, Hcs1p, Apl2p, YMR317W and YNL279W. Ino2p is the only protein in common with the data presented here. Our finding that Ino4p interacts with five bHLH proteins suggests that Ino4p is likely to be a central player in the coordination of multiple biological processes.
region helix-loop-helix zipper protein	bHLHzip	The centromere-kinetochore complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a specialized chromosomal substructure that mediates attachment of duplicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle by a regulated network of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. We have used in vitro assays to analyze putative molecular interactions between components of the yeast centromerekinetochore complex. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments showed the direct interaction of in vitro translated p110, p64, and p58 of the essential CBF3 kinetochore protein complex with Cbf1p, a basic region helix-loop-helix zipper protein (bHLHzip) that specifically binds to the CDEI region on the centromere DNA. Furthermore, recombinant p64 and p23 each stimulated the in vitro DNA binding activity of Cbf1p. The N-terminal 70 amino acids of p23 were sufficient to mediate this effect. P64 could also promote the multimerization activity of Cbf1p in the presence of centromere DNA in vitro. These results show the direct physical interaction of Cbf1p and CBF3 subunits and provide evidence that CBF3 components can promote the binding of Cbf1p to its binding site in the yeast kinetochore. A functional comparison of the centromere binding proteins with transcription factors binding at MET16 promoters reveals the strong analogy between centromeres and the MET16 promoter.
histone deacetylases	HDACs	Ssn6-Tup1 regulates multiple genes in yeast, providing a paradigm for corepressor functions. Tup1 interacts directly with histones H3 and H4, and mutation of these histones synergistically compromises Ssn6-Tup1-mediated repression. In vitro, Tup1 interacts preferentially with underacetylated isoforms of H3 and H4, suggesting that histone acetylation may modulate Tup1 functions in vivo. Here we report that histone hyperacetylation caused by combined mutations in genes encoding the histone deacetylases (HDACs) Rpd3, Hos1, and Hos2 abolishes Ssn6-Tup1 repression. Unlike HDAC mutations that do not affect repression, this combination of mutations causes concomitant hyperacetylation of both H3 and H4. Strikingly, two of these class I HDACs interact physically with Ssn6-Tup1. These findings suggest that Ssn6-Tup1 actively recruits deacetylase activities to deacetylate adjacent nucleosomes and promote Tup1-histone interactions.
forkhead-associated	FHA	The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is a phosphopeptide-binding domain first identified in a group of forkhead transcription factors but is present in a wide variety of proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In yeast and human, many proteins containing an FHA domain are found in the nucleus and involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or pre-mRNA processing. In plants, the FHA domain is part of a protein that is localized to the plasma membrane and participates in the regulation of receptor-like protein kinase signaling pathways. Recent studies show that a functional FHA domain consists of 120-140 amino acid residues, which is significantly larger than the sequence motif first described. Although FHA domains do not exhibit extensive sequence similarity, they share similar secondary and tertiary structures, featuring a sandwich of two anti-parallel (beta)-sheets. One intriguing finding is that FHA domains may bind phosphothreonine, phosphoserine and sometimes phosphotyrosine, distinguishing them from other well-studied phosphoprotein-binding domains. The diversity of proteins containing FHA domains and potential differences in binding specificities suggest the FHA domain is involved in coordinating diverse cellular processes.
HKIII-green fluorescent protein	GFP	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4, Miz-1, leptin, prostaglandin D synthase, and granulin precursor were identified as proteins interacting with the N-terminal half of mammalian Type III hexokinase (HKIII) in the yeast two-hybrid method. These interactions were confirmed by in vitro binding studies. All five of these proteins, and their mRNAs, were present in PC12 cells, as shown by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively. All were coimmunoprecipitated from PC12 extracts with an antibody against HKIII, but not with anti-Type I hexokinase. Moreover, all of these proteins were coimmunoprecipitated using antileptin as precipitating antibody, indicating the existence of a macromolecular complex including these five proteins and HKIII. Transfection of M+R 42 cells with HKIII-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs gave a diffuse intracellular fluorescence. Cotransfection with leptin or Miz-1 resulted in distinctly different localization of the HKIII-GFP fusion protein, at intracellular sites coincident with localization of leptin-GFP or Miz-1-GFP reporter constructs.
selected cell division cycle	cdc	In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, synthetic lethality has been extensively used both to characterize interactions between genes previously identified as likely to be involved in similar processes as well as to uncover new interactions. We have performed a large study of the synthetic lethal interactions of the post-Golgi sec mutations. Included in this study are the interactions of the post-Golgi sec mutations with each other, with mutations affecting earlier stages of the secretory pathway, with selected mutations affecting the actin cytoskeleton, and with selected cell division cycle (cdc) mutations affecting processes thought to be important for or involving secretion, such as polarity establishment and cytokinesis. Synthetic negative interactions of the post-Golgi sec mutations appear (as predicted) to be largely stage specific, although there are some notable exceptions. The significance of these results is discussed in the context of both secretory pathway function and the utility of synthetic lethality studies and their interpretation.
human T-cell leukemia virus type I	HTLV-I	The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) X region encoded protein p13(II) interacts with cellular proteins.
human T-cell leukemia virus type I	HTLV-I	Interactions between the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) gene product p13(II) and cellular proteins were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. Variant forms of p13(II) were derived from two HTLV-I molecular clones, K30p and K34p, that differ in both virus production and in vivo and in vitro infectivity. Two nucleotide differences between the p13 from K30p (p13K30) and K34p (p13K34) result in a Trp-Arg substitution at amino acid 17 and the truncation of the 25 carboxyl-terminal residues of p13K34. A cDNA library from an HTLV-I-infected rabbit T-cell line was screened with p13K30 and p13K34 as bait. Products of two cDNA clones, C44 and C254, interacted with p13K34 but not with p13K30. Interactions were further confirmed using the GST-fusion protein coprecipitation assay. Sequence analysis of C44 and C254 cDNA clones revealed similarities to members of the nucleoside monophosphate kinase superfamily and actin-binding protein 280, respectively. Further analysis of the function of these two proteins and the consequence of their interaction with p13 may help elucidate a role for p13 in virus production, infectivity, or the pathogenesis of HTLV-I.

2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine	POPC	PMP1 is a 38-residue plasma membrane protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that regulates the activity of the H(+)-ATPase. The cytoplasmic domain conformation results in a specific interfacial distribution of five basic side chains, thought to strongly interact with anionic phospholipids. We have used the PMP1 18-38 fragment to carry out a deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance ((2)H-NMR) study for investigating the interactions between the PMP1 cytoplasmic domain and phosphatidylserines. For this purpose, mixed bilayers of 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS) were used as model membranes (POPC/POPS 5:1, m/m). Spectra of headgroup- and chain-deuterated POPC and POPS phospholipids, POPC-d4, POPC-d31, POPS-d3, and POPS-d31, were recorded at different temperatures and for various concentrations of the PMP1 fragment. Data obtained from POPS deuterons revealed the formation of specific peptide-POPS complexes giving rise to a slow exchange between free and bound PS lipids, scarcely observed in solid-state NMR studies of lipid-peptide/protein interactions. The stoichiometry of the complex (8 POPS per peptide) was determined and its significance is discussed. The data obtained with headgroup-deuterated POPC were rationalized with a model that integrates the electrostatic perturbation induced by the cationic peptide on the negatively charged membrane interface, and a "spacer" effect due to the intercalation of POPS/PMP1f complexes between choline headgroups.

human androgen receptor	hAR	The human androgen receptor (hAR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor. We have previously proposed that c-Jun mediates the transcriptional activity of this receptor. The modular nature of hAR was used in this study to generate several fusions with the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 in an attempt to identify the c-Jun-responsive domains within the receptor. Our results suggest that the target of c-Jun action is the amino terminus (AB region) of the receptor and that hAR amino acids 502-521 are critical for the c-Jun response. Additionally, amino acids 503-555 were shown to harbor an autonomous transactivation that is stimulated by c-Jun. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transcription intermediary factor-2 (TIF-2), a coactivator that acts on the activation function-2, stimulates the full-length hAR. These results suggest that c-Jun and TIF-2 can work together as coactivators on the hAR by targeting distinct portions of the receptor.

Cla4p-green fluorescent protein	GFP	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc42p GTPase interacts with multiple regulators and downstream effectors through an approximately 25-amino-acid effector domain. Four effector domain mutations, Y32K, F37A, D38E, and Y40C, were introduced into Cdc42p and characterized for their effects on these interactions. Each mutant protein showed differential interactions with a number of downstream effectors and regulators and various levels of functionality. Specifically, Cdc42(D38E)p showed reduced interactions with the Cla4p p21-activated protein kinase and the Bem3p GTPase-activating protein and cdc42(D38E) was the only mutant allele able to complement the Deltacdc42 null mutant. However, the mutant protein was only partially functional, as indicated by a temperature-dependent multibudded phenotype seen in conjunction with defects in both septin ring localization and activation of the Swe1p-dependent morphogenetic checkpoint. Further analysis of this mutant suggested that the multiple buds emerged consecutively with a premature termination of bud enlargement preceding the appearance of the next bud. Cortical actin, the septin ring, Cla4p-green fluorescent protein (GFP), and GFP-Cdc24p all predominantly localized to one bud at a time per multibudded cell. These data suggest that Cdc42(D38E)p triggers a morphogenetic defect post-bud emergence, leading to cessation of bud growth and reorganization of the budding machinery to another random budding site, indicating that Cdc42p is involved in prevention of the initiation of supernumerary buds during the cell cycle.
RNA polymerase II	RNAP II	SSU72 is an essential gene encoding a phylogenetically conserved protein of unknown function that interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIB. A recessive ssu72-1 allele was identified as a synthetic enhancer of a TFIIB (sua7-1) defect, resulting in a heat-sensitive (Ts(-)) phenotype and a dramatic downstream shift in transcription start site selection. Here we describe a new allele, ssu72-2, that confers a Ts(-) phenotype in a SUA7 wild-type background. In an effort to further define Ssu72, we isolated suppressors of the ssu72-2 mutation. One suppressor is allelic to RPB2, the gene encoding the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Sequence analysis of the rpb2-100 suppressor defined a cysteine replacement of the phylogenetically invariant arginine residue at position 512 (R512C), located within homology block D of Rpb2. The ssu72-2 and rpb2-100 mutations adversely affected noninduced gene expression, with no apparent effects on activated transcription in vivo. Although isolated as a suppressor of the ssu72-2 Ts(-) defect, rpb2-100 enhanced the transcriptional defects associated with ssu72-2. The Ssu72 protein interacts directly with purified RNAP II in a coimmunoprecipitation assay, suggesting that the genetic interactions between ssu72-2 and rpb2-100 are a consequence of physical interactions. These results define Ssu72 as a highly conserved factor that physically and functionally interacts with the RNAP II core machinery during transcription initiation.
eIF2betagamma	eIF2	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 is a heterotrimer that binds and delivers Met-tRNA(i)(Met) to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. Initiation requires hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP, which releases an eIF2.GDP complex that is recycled to the GTP form by the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. The alpha-subunit of eIF2 plays a critical role in regulating nucleotide exchange via phosphorylation at serine 51, which converts eIF2 into a competitive inhibitor of the eIF2B-catalyzed exchange reaction. We purified a form of eIF2 (eIF2betagamma) completely devoid of the alpha-subunit to further study the role of eIF2alpha in eIF2 function. These studies utilized a yeast strain genetically altered to bypass a deletion of the normally essential eIF2alpha structural gene (SUI2). Removal of the alpha-subunit did not appear to significantly alter binding of guanine nucleotide or Met-tRNA(i)(Met) ligands by eIF2 in vitro. Qualitative assays to detect 43 S initiation complex formation and eIF5-dependent GTP hydrolysis revealed no differences between eIF2betagamma and the wild-type eIF2 heterotrimer. However, steady-state kinetic analysis of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange revealed that the absence of the alpha-subunit increased K(m) for eIF2betagamma.GDP by an order of magnitude, with a smaller increase in V(max). These data indicate that eIF2alpha is required for structural interactions between eIF2 and eIF2B that promote wild-type rates of nucleotide exchange. We suggest that this function contributes to the ability of the alpha-subunit to control the rate of nucleotide exchange through reversible phosphorylation.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 3	eIF3	Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a multisubunit complex that is required for binding of mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits, stabilization of ternary complex binding to 40 S subunits, and dissociation of 40 and 60 S subunits. These functions and the complex nature of eIF3 suggest multiple interactions with many components of the translational machinery. Recently, the subunits of mammalian and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF3 were identified, and substantial differences in the subunit composition of mammalian and S. cerevisiae were observed. Mammalian eIF3 consists of 11 nonidentical subunits, whereas S. cerevisiae eIF3 consists of up to eight nonidentical subunits. Only five of the subunits of mammalian and S. cerevisiae are shared in common, and these five subunits comprise a "core" complex in S. cerevisiae. eIF3 from wheat consists of at least 10 subunits, but their relationship to either the mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3 subunits is unknown. Peptide sequences derived from purified wheat eIF3 subunits were used to correlate each subunit with mammalian and/or S. cerevisiae subunits. The peptide sequences were also used to identify Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs for each of the eIF3 subunits. We report seven new cDNAs for A. thaliana eIF3 subunits. A. thaliana eIF3 was purified and characterized to confirm that the subunit composition and activity of wheat and A. thaliana eIF3 were similar. We report that plant eIF3 closely resembles the subunit composition of mammalian eIF3, having 10 out of 11 subunits in common. Further, we find a novel subunit in the plant eIF3 complex not present in either mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3. These results suggest that plant and mammalian eIF3 evolved similarly, whereas S. cerevisiae has diverged.
TATA box-binding protein	TBP	The general transcription factor TFIID, which is composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and a set of TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is crucial for both basal and regulated transcription by RNA polymerase II. The N-terminal small segment of yeast TAF145 (yTAF145) binds to TBP and thereby inhibits TBP function. To understand the physiological role of this inhibitory domain, which is designated as TAND (TAF N-terminal domain), we screened mutations, synthetically lethal with the TAF145 gene lacking TAND (taf145 Delta TAND), in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by exploiting a red/white colony-sectoring assay. Our screen yielded several recessive nsl (Delta TAND synthetic lethal) mutations, two of which, nsl1-1 and nsl1-2, define the same complementation group. The NSL1 gene was found to be identical to the SPT15 gene encoding TBP. Interestingly, both temperature-sensitive nsl1/spt15 alleles, which harbor the single amino acid substitutions, S118L and P65S, respectively, were defective in transcriptional activation in vivo. Several other previously characterized activation-deficient spt15 alleles also displayed synthetic lethal interactions with taf145 Delta TAND, indicating that TAND and TBP carry an overlapping but as yet unidentified function that is specifically required for transcriptional regulation.

temperature-sensitive allele of SNC1	SNC1	In yeast, homologues of the synaptobrevin/VAMP family of v-SNAREs (Snc1 and Snc2) confer the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles at the cell surface. As no v-SNARE has been shown to confer endocytosis, we examined whether yeast lacking the SNC genes, or possessing a temperature-sensitive allele of SNC1 (SNC1(ala43)), are deficient in the endocytic uptake of components from the cell surface. We found that both SNC and temperature-shifted SNC1(ala43) yeast are deficient in their ability to deliver the soluble dye FM4-64 to the vacuole. Under conditions in which vesicles accumulate, FM4-64 stained primarily the cytoplasm as well as fragmented vacuoles. In addition, alpha-factor-stimulated endocytosis of the alpha-factor receptor, Ste2, was fully blocked, as evidenced using a Ste2-green fluorescent protein fusion protein as well as metabolic labeling studies. This suggests a direct role for Snc v-SNAREs in the retrieval of membrane proteins from the cell surface. Moreover, this idea is supported by genetic and physical data that demonstrate functional interactions with t-SNAREs that confer endosomal transport (e.g., Tlg1,2). Notably, Snc1(ala43) was found to be nonfunctional in cells lacking Tlg1 or Tlg2. Thus, we propose that synaptobrevin/VAMP family members are engaged in anterograde and retrograde protein sorting steps between the Golgi and the plasma membrane.
lectin wheat germ agglutinin	WGA	The study of the nuclear pore in vertebrates would benefit from a strategy to directly identify new nucleoporins and interactions between those nucleoporins. We have developed a novel two-step "organelle trap" assay involving affinity selection and in vitro pore assembly. In the first step, soluble proteins derived from Xenopus egg extracts are applied to a column containing a ligand of interest. The bound proteins are then tagged by biotinylation and eluted. In the second step, potential nucleoporins are selected for by virtue of their ability to assemble into annulate lamellae, a cytoplasmic mimic of nuclear pores. The incorporated proteins are then recognized by their biotin tag. Here we use the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as ligand; WGA inhibits nuclear transport and has been shown to directly bind three known nucleoporins from Xenopus extract, Nup62, Nup98, and Nup214, all of which contain N-acetylglucosamine residues. Under reduced-stringency conditions, three additional proteins bind to WGA-Sepharose and are revealed by the organelle trap assay. We identified all three as partner nucleoporins. Two were discovered to be Xenopus Nup93 and Nup205. The third is a novel vertebrate nucleoporin, Nup188. This new vertebrate protein, Xenopus Nup188, exists in a complex with xNup93 and xNup205. The Nup93-Nup188-Nup205 complex does not bind directly to WGA but binds indirectly via the N-acetylglucosamine-modified nucleoporins. A gene encoding human Nup188 was also identified. The discovery of vertebrate Nup188, related to a yeast nucleoporin, and its novel protein-protein interactions illustrates the power of the two-step organelle trap assay and identifies new building blocks for constructing the nuclear pore.
signal recognition particle	SRP	In posttranslational translocation in yeast, completed protein substrates are transported across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a translocation channel formed by the Sec complex. We have used photo-cross-linking to investigate interactions of cytosolic proteins with a substrate synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate system, before its posttranslational translocation through the channel in the yeast membrane. Upon termination of translation, the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) are released from the polypeptide chain, and the full-length substrate interacts with several different cytosolic proteins. At least two distinct complexes exist that contain among other proteins either 70-kD heat shock protein (Hsp70) or tailless complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1) ring complex/chaperonin containing TCP1 (TRiC/CCT), which keep the substrate competent for translocation. None of the cytosolic factors appear to interact specifically with the signal sequence. Dissociation of the cytosolic proteins from the substrate is accelerated to the same extent by the Sec complex and an unspecific GroEL trap, indicating that release occurs spontaneously without the Sec complex playing an active role. Once bound to the Sec complex, the substrate is stripped of all cytosolic proteins, allowing it to subsequently be transported through the membrane channel without the interference of cytosolic binding partners.

kinesin-like proteins	klps	Cytoplasmic microtubules are critical for establishing and maintaining cell shape and polarity. Our investigations of kinesin-like proteins (klps) and morphological mutants in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified a kinesin-like gene, tea2(+), that is required for cells to generate proper polarized growth. Cells deleted for this gene are often bent during exponential growth and initiate growth from improper sites as they exit stationary phase. They have a reduced cytoplasmic microtubule network and display severe morphological defects in genetic backgrounds that produce long cells. The tip-specific marker, Tea1p, is mislocalized in both tea2-1 and tea2Delta cells, indicating that Tea2p function is necessary for proper localization of Tea1p. Tea2p is localized to the tips of the cell and in a punctate pattern within the cell, often coincident with the ends of cytoplasmic microtubules. These results suggest that this kinesin promotes microtubule growth, possibly through interactions with the microtubule end, and that it is important for establishing and maintaining polarized growth along the long axis of the cell.
small nuclear RNAs	snRNAs	The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp19p protein is an essential splicing factor and a spliceosomal component. It is not tightly associated with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) but is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight proteins. We have identified two novel components of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc30p and Ntc20p. Like other identified components of the complex, both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p immediately after or concurrently with dissociation of U4, indicating that the entire complex may bind to the spliceosome as an intact form. Neither Ntc30p nor Ntc20p directly interacts with Prp19p, but both interact with another component of the complex, Ntc85p. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an ordered interactions of these components in formation of the Prp19p-associated complex. Although null mutants of NTC30 or NTC20 showed no obvious growth phenotype, deletion of both genes impaired yeast growth resulting in accumulation of precursor mRNA. Extracts prepared from such a strain were defective in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, but the splicing activity could be restored upon addition of the purified Prp19p-associated complex. These results indicate that Ntc30p and Ntc20p are auxiliary splicing factors the functions of which may be modulating the function of the Prp19p-associated complex.
neuronal Sec1	nSec1	The control of protein-protein interactions is a fundamental aspect of cell regulation. Here we describe a new approach to detect the interaction of two proteins in vivo. By this method, one binding partner is an integral membrane protein whereas the other is soluble but fused to a G-protein gamma-subunit. If the binding partners interact, G-protein signaling is disrupted. We demonstrate interaction between known binding partners, syntaxin 1a with neuronal Sec1 (nSec1), and the fibroblast-derived growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) with SNT-1. In addition, we describe a genetic screen to identify nSec1 mutants that are expressed normally, but are no longer able to bind to syntaxin 1a. This provides a convenient method to study interactions of integral membrane proteins, a class of molecules that has been difficult to study by existing biochemical or genetic methods.

RNA polymerase II	pol II	Strong evidence indicates that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) is a highly regulated process. Here we present genetic results that indicate a role for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtf1 protein in transcription elongation. A screen for synthetic lethal mutations was carried out with an rtf1 deletion mutation to identify factors that interact with Rtf1 or regulate the same process as Rtf1. The screen uncovered mutations in SRB5, CTK1, FCP1, and POB3. These genes encode an Srb/mediator component, a CTD kinase, a CTD phosphatase, and a protein involved in the regulation of transcription by chromatin structure, respectively. All of these gene products have been directly or indirectly implicated in transcription elongation, indicating that Rtf1 may also regulate this process. In support of this view, we show that RTF1 functionally interacts with genes that encode known elongation factors, including SPT4, SPT5, SPT16, and PPR2. We also show that a deletion of RTF1 causes sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid, phenotypes correlated with a transcription elongation defect. Collectively, our results suggest that Rtf1 may function as a novel transcription elongation factor in yeast.
proliferating cell nuclear antigen	PCNA	Eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair requires the concerted action of several proteins, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and heterodimers of MSH2 complexed with either MSH3 or MSH6. Here we report that MSH3 and MSH6, but not MSH2, contain N-terminal sequence motifs characteristic of proteins that bind to PCNA. MSH3 and MSH6 peptides containing these motifs bound PCNA, as did the intact Msh2-Msh6 complex. This binding was strongly reduced when alanine was substituted for conserved residues in the motif. Yeast strains containing alanine substitutions in the PCNA binding motif of Msh6 or Msh3 had elevated mutation rates, indicating that these interactions are important for genome stability. When human MSH3 or MSH6 peptides containing the PCNA binding motif were added to a human cell extract, mismatch repair activity was inhibited at a step preceding DNA resynthesis. Thus, MSH3 and MSH6 interactions with PCNA may facilitate early steps in DNA mismatch repair and may also be important for other roles of these eukaryotic MutS homologs.
cytochrome c maturation	Ccm	Cytochrome c maturation involves the translocation of a polypeptide, the apocytochrome, and its cofactor, haem, through a membrane, before the two molecules are ligated covalently. This review article focuses on the current knowledge on the journey of haem during this process, which is known best in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. As haem always occurs bound to protein, its passage across the cytoplasmic membrane and incorporation into the apocytochrome appears to be mediated by a set of proteinaceous maturation factors, the Ccm (cytochrome c maturation) proteins. At least three of them, CcmC, CcmE and CcmF, are thought to interact directly with haem. CcmE binds haem covalently, thus representing an intermediate of the haem trafficking pathway. CcmC is required for binding of haem to CcmE, and CcmF for releasing it from CcmE and transferring it onto the apocytochrome. The mechanism by which haem crosses the cytoplasmic membrane is currently unknown.
phosphorylation state	CTD	Transcription by RNA polymerase II is accompanied by cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of its largest subunit. We have used deletion and point mutations in Fcp1p, a TFIIF-interacting CTD phosphatase, to show that the integrity of its BRCT domain, like that of its catalytic domain, is important for cell viability, mRNA synthesis, and CTD dephosphorylation in vivo. Although regions of Fcp1p carboxy terminal to its BRCT domain and at its amino terminus were not essential for viability, deletion of either of these regions affected the phosphorylation state of the CTD. Two portions of this carboxy-terminal region of Fcp1p bound directly to the first cyclin-like repeat in the core domain of the general transcription factor TFIIB, as well as to the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF. These regulatory interactions with Fcp1p involved closely related amino acid sequence motifs in TFIIB and RAP74. Mutating the Fcp1p-binding motif KEFGK in the RAP74 (Tfg1p) subunit of TFIIF to EEFGE led to both synthetic phenotypes in certain fcp1 tfg1 double mutants and a reduced ability of Fcp1p to activate transcription when it is artificially tethered to a promoter. These results suggest strongly that this KEFGK motif in RAP74 mediates its interaction with Fcp1p in vivo.
cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 1	Cks1	BACKGROUND: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Cks1 (cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 1) is essential for cell-cycle progression. The biological function of Cks1 can be modulated by a switch between two distinct molecular assemblies: the single domain fold, which results from the closing of a beta-hinge motif, and the intersubunit beta-strand interchanged dimer, which arises from the opening of the beta-hinge motif. The crystal structure of a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) in complex with the human Cks homolog CksHs1 single-domain fold revealed the importance of conserved hydrophobic residues and charged residues within the beta-hinge motif. RESULTS: The 3.0 A resolution Cks1 structure reveals the strict structural conservation of the Cks alpha/beta-core fold and the beta-hinge motif. The beta hinge identified in the Cks1 structure includes a novel pivot and exposes a cluster of conserved tyrosine residues that are involved in Cdk binding but are sequestered in the beta-interchanged Cks homolog suc1 dimer structure. This Cks1 structure confirms the conservation of the Cks anion-binding site, which interacts with sidechain residues from the C-terminal alpha helix of another subunit in the crystal. CONCLUSIONS: The Cks1 structure exemplifies the conservation of the beta-interchanged dimer and the anion-binding site in evolutionarily distant yeast and human Cks homologs. Mutational analyses including in vivo rescue of CKS1 disruption support the dual functional roles of the beta-hinge residue Glu94, which participates in Cdk binding, and of the anion-binding pocket that is located 22 A away and on an opposite face to Glu94. The Cks1 structure suggests a biological role for the beta-interchanged dimer and the anion-binding site in targeting Cdks to specific phosphoproteins during cell-cycle progression.

RVS167, LAS17, YNL094w, YMR192	RVS167	The Rvs161p and Rvs167p proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologues of higher eukaryotes' amphiphysins, associate with actin and appear to be involved in several functions related to the actin cytoskeleton. In order to identify partners of the Rvsp proteins, yeast libraries constructed in two-hybrid vectors were screened using either Rvs167p or Rvs161p as a bait. The selected candidates, representing 34 ORFs, were then tested against both Rvsp proteins, as well as domains of Rvs167p or Rvs161p. Among the most significant ones, 24 ORFs were specific preys of Rvs167p only and two gave interactions with Rvs161p only. Interestingly, five ORFs were preys of both Rvs161p and Rvs167p (RVS167, LAS17, YNL094w, YMR192w and YPL249c). Analysis of putative functions of the candidates confirm involvement of the Rvsp in endocytosis/vesicle traffic, but also opens possible new fields, such as nuclear functions.

regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)	RGS	Members of the newly discovered regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) families of proteins have a common RGS domain. This RGS domain is necessary for conferring upon RGS proteins the capacity to regulate negatively a variety of Galpha protein subunits. However, RGS proteins are more than simply negative regulators of signaling. RGS proteins can function as effector antagonists, and recent evidence suggests that RGS proteins can have positive effects on signaling as well. Many RGS proteins possess additional C- and N-terminal modular protein-binding domains and motifs. The presence of these additional modules within the RGS proteins provides for multiple novel regulatory interactions performed by these molecules. These regions are involved in conferring regulatory selectivity to specific Galpha-coupled signaling pathways, enhancing the efficacy of the RGS domain, and the translocation or targeting of RGS proteins to intracellular membranes. In other instances, these domains are involved in cross-talk between different Galpha-coupled signaling pathways and, in some cases, likely serve to integrate small GTPases with these G protein signaling pathways. This review discusses these C- and N-terminal domains and their roles in the biology of the brain-enriched RGS proteins. Methods that can be used to investigate the function of these domains are also discussed.
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins	IAPs	Using a heterologous yeast expression assay, we show that inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) suppress caspase-3-mediated cytotoxicity in the order of XIAP>c-IAP2>c-IAP1>survivin. The same ordering of IAP activities was demonstrated in mammalian cells expressing an auto-activating caspase-3. The relative anti-apoptotic activities of each IAP depended on the particular death stimulus. For IAP-expressing cells treated with camptothecin, survival correlated with their intrinsic anti-caspase-3 activity. However, c-IAP1-transfected cells were disproportionately resistant to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that its anti-apoptotic activities extend beyond caspase-3 or -7 inhibition. Yeast-based caspase assays provide rapid, reliable information on specificity and activity of the IAPs and aid in identifying critical targets in mammalian apoptotic pathways.
lipoprotein(a)	Lp(a)	Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a major independent risk factor for atherothrombotic disease in humans. The physiological function(s) of Lp(a) as well as the precise mechanism(s) by which high plasma levels of Lp(a) increase risk are unknown. Binding of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) to fibrin(ogen) and other components of the blood clotting cascade has been demonstrated in vitro, but the domains in fibrin(ogen) critical for interaction are undefined. We used apo(a) kringle IV subtypes to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast GAL4 two-hybrid interaction trap system. Among positive clones that emerged from the screen, clones were identified as fibrinogen beta- and gamma-chains. Peptide-based pull-down experiments confirmed that the emerging peptide motif, conserved in the carboxyl-terminal globular domains of the fibrinogen beta and gamma modules specifically interacts with apo(a)/Lp(a) in human plasma as well as in cell culture supernatants of HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, ectopically expressing apo(a)/Lp(a). The influence of lysine in the fibrinogen peptides and of lysine binding sites in apo(a) for the interaction was evaluated by binding experiments with apo(a) mutants and a mutated fibrin(ogen) peptid. This confirmed the lysine binding sites in kringle IV type 10 of apo(a) as the major fibrin(ogen) binding site but also demonstrated lysine-independent interactions.

general transcription factor	TF	The yeast Gal11 protein is an important component of the Mediator complex in RNA polymerase II-directed transcription. Gal11 and the general transcription factor (TF) IIE are involved in regulation of the protein kinase activity of TFIIH that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. We have previously shown that Gal11 binds the small and large subunits of TFIIE at two Gal11 domains, A and B, respectively, which are important for normal function of Gal11 in vivo. Here we demonstrate that Gal11 binds directly to TFIIH through domain A in vitro. A null mutation in GAL11 caused lethality of cells when combined with temperature-sensitive mutations in the genes encoding TFIIE or the carboxyl-terminal domain kinase, indicating the presence of genetic interactions between Gal11 and these proteins. Mutational depletion of Gal11 or TFIIE caused inefficient opening of the transcription initiation region, but had no significant effect on TATA-binding protein occupancy of the TATA sequence in vivo. These results suggest that the functions of Gal11 and TFIIE are necessary after recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the TATA box presumably at the step of stable preinitiation complex formation and/or promoter melting. We illustrate genetic interactions between Gal11 and other Mediator components such as Med2 and Pgd1/Hrs1/Med3.
activation domains	ADs	Activation domains (ADs) appear to work by making specific protein-protein contacts with the transcriptional machinery. However, ADs show no apparent sequence conservation, they can be functionally replaced by a number of random peptides and unrelated proteins, and their function does not depend on sustaining a complex tertiary structure. To gain a broader perspective on the nature of interactions between acidic ADs and several of their proposed targets, the in vivo strengths of viral, human, yeast, and artificial activation domains were determined under physiological conditions, and mutant ADs with increased in vivo potencies were selected. The affinities between ADs and proposed targets were determined in vitro and all interactions were found to be of low-level affinity with dissociation constants above 10(-7)M. However, in vivo potencies of all ADs correlated nearly perfectly with their affinities for transcriptional proteins. Surprisingly, the weak interactions of the different ADs with at least two non-transcriptional proteins show the same rank order of binding and AD mutants selected for increased in vivo strength also have increased affinities to non-transcriptional proteins. Based on these results, isolated acidic ADs can bind with relatively low-level specificity and affinity to many different proteins and the strength of these semi-specific interactions determine the strength of an AD. I suggest that ADs expose flexible hydrophobic elements in an aqueous environment to contact hydrophobic patches over short distances, shifting specificity of activators largely to the DNA colocalization of arrays of ADs and targets.

glucocorticoid receptor	GR	We have shown that yeast mutants with defects in the Ada adaptor proteins are defective in hormone-dependent gene activation by ectopically expressed human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Others have shown that the Ada2 protein is required for physical interactions between some activation domains and TBP (TATA-binding protein), whereas the Gcn5 (Ada4) protein has a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Although all HAT enzymes are able to acetylate histone substrates, some also acetylate non-histone proteins. Taken together, these observations suggest that the Ada proteins have the ability to effect different steps in the process of gene activation. It has recently been shown that the Ada proteins are present in two distinct protein complexes, the Ada complex and a larger SAGA complex. Our recent work has focused on determining (1) which of the Ada-containing complexes mediates gene activation by GR, (2) whether the HAT activity encoded by GCN5 is required for GR-dependent gene activation, (3) whether the Ada proteins contribute to GR-mediated activation at the level of chromatin remodelling and (4) how the role of these HAT complexes is integrated with other chromatin remodelling activities during GR-mediated gene activation. Our results suggest a model in which GR recruits the SAGA complex and that this contributes to chromatin remodelling via a mechanism involving the acetylation of histones. Furthermore, recruitment of the SWI/SNF remodelling complex also has a role in GR-mediated activation that is independent of the role of SAGA. These complexes are similar to analogous mammalian complexes and therefore these results are likely to be relevant to the human system.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 7	Cdk7	Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) forms a trimeric complex with cyclin H and Mat1 to form the mammalian Cdk-activating kinase, CAK, as well as a part of the basal transcription factor TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Here, we report a novel interaction between Cdk7 and a histidine triad (HIT) family protein, Hint/PKCI-1. This interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid study and subsequently verified by co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization studies, where overexpression of Cdk7 leads to partial relocalization of Hint to the nucleus. The physical association is independent of cyclin H binding or Cdk7 kinase activity and is conserved between the related Sacharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinase Kin28 and the HIT protein Hnt1. Furthermore, combination of a disruption of HNT1 and a KIN28 temperature-sensitive allele in S. cerevisiae led to highly elongated cell morphology and reduced colony formation, indicating a genetic interaction between KIN28 and HNT1. The physical and genetic interactions of Hint and Hnt1 with Cdk7 and Kin28 suggest a role for this class of histidine triad proteins in the regulation of Cdk7 and Kin28 functions.

centromere	HFD	Cse4p is an evolutionarily conserved histone H3-like protein that is thought to replace H3 in a specialized nucleosome at the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) centromere. All known yeast, worm, fly, and human centromere H3-like proteins have highly conserved C-terminal histone fold domains (HFD) but very different N termini. We have carried out a comprehensive and systematic mutagenesis of the Cse4p N terminus to analyze its function. Surprisingly, only a 33-amino-acid domain within the 130-amino-acid-long N terminus is required for Cse4p N-terminal function. The spacing of the essential N-terminal domain (END) relative to the HFD can be changed significantly without an apparent effect on Cse4p function. The END appears to be important for interactions between Cse4p and known kinetochore components, including the Ctf19p/Mcm21p/Okp1p complex. Genetic and biochemical evidence shows that Cse4p proteins interact with each other in vivo and that nonfunctional cse4 END and HFD mutant proteins can form functional mixed complexes. These results support different roles for the Cse4p N terminus and the HFD in centromere function and are consistent with the proposed Cse4p nucleosome model. The structure-function characteristics of the Cse4p N terminus are relevant to understanding how other H3-like proteins, such as the human homolog CENP-A, function in kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation.

Ala-648 to Pro	A648P	Topoisomerase II is an ATP-operated protein clamp that captures a DNA helix and transports it through another DNA duplex, allowing chromosome segregation at mitosis. A number of cytotoxic bisdioxopiperazines such as ICRF-193 target topoisomerase II by binding and trapping the closed enzyme clamp. To investigate this unusual mode of action, we have used yeast to select plasmid-borne human topoisomerase IIalpha alleles resistant to ICRF-193. Mutations in topoisomerase IIalpha of Leu-169 to Phe (L169F) (in the N-terminal ATPase domain) and Ala-648 to Pro (A648P) (in the core domain) were identified as conferring >50-fold and 5-fold resistance to ICRF-193 in vivo, respectively. The L169F mutation, located next to the Walker A box ATP-binding sequence, resulted in a mutant enzyme displaying ICRF-193-resistant topoisomerase and ATPase activities and whose closed clamp was refractory to ICRF-193-mediated trapping as an annulus on closed circular DNA. These data imply that the mutation interferes directly with ICRF-193 binding to the N-terminal ATPase gate. In contrast, the A648P enzyme displayed topoisomerase activities exhibiting wild-type sensitivity to ICRF-193. We suggest that the inefficient trapping of the A648P closed clamp results either from the observed increased ATP requirement, or more likely, from lowered salt stability, perhaps involving destabilization of ICRF-193 interactions with the B'-B' interface in the core domain. These results provide evidence for at least two different phenotypic classes of ICRF-193 resistance mutations and suggest that bisdioxopiperazine action involves the interplay of both the ATPase and core domains of topoisomerase IIalpha.
prereplicative complex	pre-RC	Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 plays an essential role in establishing and maintaining the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) by interacting with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and associating with chromatin origins. These interactions are required to load minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs) and other initiator proteins onto replication origins. Although the temperature-sensitive cdc6 mutant, cdc6-1, has been widely used for these studies, the molecular mechanism of the cdc6-1 mutation has been unclear. In this study, we have identified a base substitution at Gly260-->Asp, near the CDC-NTP motif. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP), we found that cdc6-1 fails to load Mcm5 onto the replication origins. Chromatin fractions were used to study Mcm5 binding in both the wildtype and mutant background. These studies indicated that Cdc6 is also involved in unloading Mcm5 from chromatin. Specifically, the cdc6-1 mutation protein, cdc6(G260D), which failed to load Mcm5 onto replication origins, also failed to unload the Mcm5 protein. Furthermore, the overexpression of wildtype CDC6 accelerated the unloading of Mcm5 from chromatin fractions. In the absence of functional Cdc6, the Mcm5 protein showed nonorigin binding to chromatin with the cell cycle arrested at the G1S phase transition. Our results suggested that the cdc6(G260D) mutant protein fails to assemble an operational replicative complex and that wildtype Cdc6 plays a role in preventing re-replication by controlling the unloading the MCMs from chromatin origins.

heat shock factor	HSF	In the nucleus, transcription factors must contend with the presence of chromatin in order to gain access to their cognate regulatory sequences. As most nuclear DNA is assembled into nucleosomes, activators must either invade a stable, preassembled nucleosome or preempt the formation of nucleosomes on newly replicated DNA, which is transiently free of histones. We have investigated the mechanism by which heat shock factor (HSF) binds to target nucleosomal heat shock elements (HSEs), using as our model a dinucleosomal heat shock promoter (hsp82-DeltaHSE1). We find that activated HSF cannot bind a stable, sequence-positioned nucleosome in G(1)-arrested cells. It can do so readily, however, following release from G(1) arrest or after the imposition of either an early S- or late G(2)-phase arrest. Surprisingly, despite the S-phase requirement, HSF nucleosomal binding activity is restored in the absence of hsp82 replication. These results contrast with the prevailing paradigm for activator-nucleosome interactions and implicate a nonreplicative, S-phase-specific event as a prerequisite for HSF binding to nucleosomal sites in vivo.

cyclic AMP	cAMP	A significant challenge to our understanding of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is to determine how multiple signal transduction pathways converge on a single promoter to regulate transcription in divergent fashions. To study this, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe fbp1 gene that is repressed by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and is activated by a stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In this study, we identified and characterized two cis-acting elements in the fbp1 promoter required for activation of fbp1 transcription. Upstream activation site 1 (UAS1), located approximately 900 bp from the transcriptional start site, resembles a cAMP response element (CRE) that is the binding site for the atf1-pcr1 heterodimeric transcriptional activator. Binding of this activator to UAS1 is positively regulated by the MAPK pathway and negatively regulated by PKA. UAS2, located approximately 250 bp from the transcriptional start site, resembles a Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress response element. UAS2 is bound by transcriptional activators and repressors regulated by both the PKA and MAPK pathways, although atf1 itself is not present in these complexes. Transcriptional regulation of fbp1 promoter constructs containing only UAS1 or UAS2 confirms that the PKA and MAPK regulation is targeted to both sites. We conclude that the PKA and MAPK signal transduction pathways regulate fbp1 transcription at UAS1 and UAS2, but that the antagonistic interactions between these pathways involve different mechanisms at each site.

mitochondrial transport proteins	MTP	Mitochondrial transport proteins (MTP) typically are homodimeric with a 30-kDa subunit with six transmembrane helices. The subunit possesses a sequence motif highly similar to Pro X Asp/Glu X X Lys/Arg X Arg within each of its three similar 10-kDa segments. Four (YNL083W, YFR045W, YPR021C, YDR470C) of the 35 yeast (S. cerevisiae) MTP genes were resequenced since the masses of their proteins deviate significantly from the typical 30 kDa. We now find these four proteins to have 545, 285, 902, and 502 residues, respectively. Together with only four other MTPs, the sequences of YPR021C and YDR470C show substitutions of some of the five residues that are absolutely conserved among the 12 MTPs with identified transport function and 17 other MTPs. We do now find these five consensus residues also in the new sequences of YNL083W and YFR045W. Additional analyses of the 35 yeast MTPs show that the location of transmembrane helix sequences do not correlate with the general consensus residues of the MTP family; protein segments connecting the six transmembrane helices and facing the intermembrane space are not uniformly short (about 20 residues) or long (about 40 residues) when facing the matrix; most MTPs have at least one transmembrane helix for which the sum of the negative hydropathy values of all residues yields a very small negative value, suggesting a membrane location bordering polar faces of other transmembrane helices or a non-transmembrane location. The extra residues of the three large MTPs are hydrophilic and at the N-terminal. The 200-residue N-terminal segment of YNL083W has four putative Ca2+-binding sites. The 500-residue N-terminal segment of YPR021C shows sequence similarity to enzymes of nucleic acid metabolism. cDNA microarray data show that YNL083W is expressed solely during sporulation, while the expressions of YFR045W, YPR021C, and YDR470C are induced by various stress situations. These results also show that the 35 MTP genes are expressed under a rather diverse set of metabolic conditions that may help identify the function of the proteins. Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid screens, that will also be useful in identifying the function of MTPs, indicate that MIR1, AAC3, YOR100C, and YPR011C do interact with non-MTPs.
yeast spindle pole body	SPB	The earliest known step in yeast spindle pole body (SPB) duplication requires Cdc31p and Kar1p, two physically interacting SPB components, and Dsk2p and Rad23p, a pair of ubiquitin-like proteins. Components of the PKC1 pathway were found to interact with these SPB duplication genes in two independent genetic screens. Initially, SLG1 and PKC1 were obtained as high-copy suppressors of dsk2Delta rad23Delta and a mutation in MPK1 was synthetically lethal with kar1-Delta17. Subsequently, we demonstrated extensive genetic interactions between the PKC1 pathway and the SPB duplication mutants that affect Cdc31p function. The genetic interactions are unlikely to be related to the cell-wall integrity function of the PKC1 pathway because the SPB mutants did not exhibit cell-wall defects. Overexpression of multiple PKC1 pathway components suppressed the G2/M arrest of the SPB duplication mutants and mutations in MPK1 exacerbated the cell cycle arrest of kar1-Delta17, suggesting a role for the PKC1 pathway in SPB duplication. We also found that mutations in SPC110, which encodes a major SPB component, showed genetic interactions with both CDC31 and the PKC1 pathway. In support of the model that the PKC1 pathway regulates SPB duplication, one of the phosphorylated forms of Spc110p was absent in pkc1 and mpk1Delta mutants.
Signal recognition particle	SRP	Signal recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins for co-translational insertion through or into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Mammalian SRP slows nascent chain elongation by the ribosome during targeting in vitro. This 'elongation arrest' activity requires the SRP9/14 subunit of the particle and interactions of the C-terminus of SRP14. We have purified SRP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrated that it too has elongation arrest activity. A yeast SRP containing Srp14p truncated at its C-terminus (delta C29) did not maintain elongation arrest, was substantially deficient in promoting translocation and interfered with targeting by wild-type SRP. In vivo, this mutation conferred a constitutive defect in the coupling of protein translation and translocation and temperature-sensitive growth, but only a slight defect in protein translocation. In combination, these data indicate that the primary defect in SRP delta C29 is in elongation arrest, and that this is a physiologically important and conserved function of eukaryotic SRP.
mismatch repair	MMR	Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins play a critical role in maintaining the mitotic stability of eukaryotic genomes. MMR proteins repair errors made during DNA replication and in their absence, mutations accumulate at elevated rates. In addition, MMR proteins inhibit recombination between non-identical DNA sequences, and hence prevent genome rearrangements resulting from interactions between repetitive elements. This review provides an overview of the anti-mutator and anti-recombination functions of MMR proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks	DSBs	The ends of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be accurately rejoined by at least two discrete pathways, homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). The NHEJ pathway is essential for repair of specific classes of DSB termini in cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Endonuclease-induced DSBs retaining complementary single-stranded DNA overhangs are repaired efficiently by end-joining. In contrast, damaged DSB ends (e.g., termini produced by ionizing radiation) are poor substrates for this pathway. NHEJ repair involves the functions of at least 10 genes, including YKU70, YKU80, DNL4, LIF1, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, RAD50, MRE11, and XRS2. Most or all of these genes are required for efficient recombination-independent recircularization of linearized plasmids and for rejoining of EcoRI endonuclease-induced chromosomal DSBs in vivo. Several NHEJ mutants also display aberrant processing and rejoining of DSBs that are generated by HO endonuclease or formed spontaneously in dicentric plasmids. In addition, all NHEJ genes except DNL4 and LIF1 are required for stabilization of telomeric repeat sequences. Each of the proteins involved in NHEJ appears to bind, directly or through protein associations, with the ends of linear DNA. Enzymatic and/or structural roles in the rejoining of DSB termini have been postulated for several proteins within the group. Most yeast NHEJ genes have homologues in human cells and many biochemical activities and protein:protein interactions have been conserved in higher eucaryotes. Similarities and differences between NHEJ repair in yeast and mammalian cells are discussed.

Oligosaccharyltransferase	OT	Oligosaccharyltransferase (OT) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an enzyme complex consisting of 8 transmembrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Studies on potential protein-protein interactions in OT using a two-hybrid library screen revealed that protein kinase C (Pkc1p) interacted with the lumenal domains of several OT subunits. Additional genetic experiments revealed that overexpression of two OT subunits rescued the growth defect caused by overexpression of a Pkc1 active site mutant, implying that there are specific genetic interactions between PKC1 and OT. These in vivo findings were complemented by in vitro studies that showed that several of the OT subunits bound to a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase linked via its C-terminus to Pkc1p. Assays of OT activity, in which glycosylation of a simple acceptor peptide was assayed in microsomes from wild-type and a pkc1 null revealed a 50% reduction in activity in the microsomes from the null strain. In contrast, strains containing null mutations of two other genes known to be downstream of Pkc1p in the PKC1-MAP kinase pathway had a level of OT activity comparable to that of wild-type cells. These in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that in yeast cells Pkc1p may be involved in regulation of the N-glycosylation of proteins.

pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase	PNPOx	BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a cofactor used by many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. The enzyme oxidizes either the 4'-hydroxyl group of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) or the 4'-primary amine of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) to an aldehyde. PNPOx is a homodimeric enzyme with one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) molecule non-covalently bound to each subunit. A high degree of sequence homology among the 15 known members of the PNPOx family suggests that all members of this group have similar three-dimensional folds. RESULTS: The crystal structure of PNPOx from E. coli has been determined to 1.8 A resolution. The monomeric subunit folds into an eight-stranded beta sheet surrounded by five alpha-helical structures. Two monomers related by a twofold axis interact extensively along one-half of each monomer to form the dimer. There are two clefts at the dimer interface that are symmetry-related and extend from the top to the bottom of the dimer. An FMN cofactor that makes interactions with both subunits is located in each of these two clefts. CONCLUSIONS: The structure is quite similar to the recently deposited 2.7 A structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PNPOx and also, remarkably, shares a common structural fold with the FMN-binding protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and a domain of chymotrypsin. This high-resolution E. coli PNPOx structure permits predictions to be made about residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. These predictions provide testable hypotheses, which can be answered by making site-directed mutants.

rainbow trout estrogen receptor	rtER	The amino acid sequence of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rtER) is highly conserved in the C domain but presents few similarities in the A/B and E domains with human estrogen receptor alpha (hER) [NR3A1]. A previous study has shown that rtER and hER have differential functional activities in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To determine the domain(s) responsible for these differences, chimeric human/rainbow trout estrogen receptors were constructed. The A/B, C/D or E/F regions of rtER were replaced by corresponding regions of hER and expressed in yeast cells. Ligand-binding and transcription activation abilities of these hybrid receptors were compared with those of wild-type rtER or hER. Surprisingly, our data revealed that the human C/D domains play an important role in the magnitude of transactivation of ER. Two other chimeric ERs carrying either a C or D domain of hER showed that the C domain was responsible for this effect whereas the D domain did not affect hybrid receptor activities. Moreover, a chimeric hER carrying the C domain of rtER showed maximal transcriptional activity similar to that observed with rtER. Gel shift assays showed that, whereas rtER and hER present a similar binding affinity to an estrogen response element (ERE) element, the rtER C domain is responsible for a weaker DNA binding stability compared to those of hER. In addition, the human C domain allows approximately 2 times faster association of ER to an ERE. Utilization of reporter genes containing one or three EREs confirms that rtER requires protein-protein interactions for its stabilization on DNA and that the C domain is involved in this stabilization. Moreover, AF-1 may be implicated in this synergistic effect of EREs. Interestingly, although E domains of these two receptors are much less conserved, replacement of this domain in rtER by its human counterpart resulted in higher estradiol sensitivity but no increase in the magnitude of transactivation. Data from the chimeric receptors, rtER(hC) and hER(rtC), demonstrated that rtER AF-1 and AF-2 activation domains activated transcription in the presence of estradiol similar to both AF-1 and AF-2 hER. This implies that these domains, which show poor sequence homology, may interact with similar basal transcription factors.

Like Sm) proteins	Lsm	A set of seven structurally related Sm proteins forms the core of the snRNP particles containing the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs. A search of the genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified a number of open reading frames that potentially encode structurally similar proteins termed Lsm (Like Sm) proteins. With the aim of analysing all possible interactions between the Lsm proteins and any protein encoded in the yeast genome, we performed exhaustive and iterative genomic two-hybrid screens, starting with the Lsm proteins as baits. Indeed, extensive interactions amongst eight Lsm proteins were found that suggest the existence of a Lsm complex or complexes. These Lsm interactions apparently involve the conserved Sm domain that also mediates interactions between the Sm proteins. The screens also reveal functionally significant interactions with splicing factors, in particular with Prp4 and Prp24, compatible with genetic studies and with the reported association of Lsm proteins with spliceosomal U6 and U4/U6 particles. In addition, interactions with proteins involved in mRNA turnover, such as Mrt1, Dcp1, Dcp2 and Xrn1, point to roles for Lsm complexes in distinct RNA metabolic processes, that are confirmed in independent functional studies. These results provide compelling evidence that two-hybrid screens yield functionally meaningful information about protein-protein interactions and can suggest functions for uncharacterized proteins, especially when they are performed on a genome-wide scale.

trypanosome small nuclear ribonucleoproteins	snRNPs	Each of the trypanosome small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) U2, U4/U6, and U5, as well as the spliced leader (SL) RNP, contains a core of common proteins, which we have previously identified. This core is unusual because it is not recognized by anti-Sm Abs and it associates with an Sm-related sequence in the trypanosome small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Using peptide sequences derived from affinity-purified U2 snRNP proteins, we have cloned cDNAs for five common proteins of 8.5, 10, 12.5, 14, and 15 kDa of Trypanosoma brucei and identified them as Sm proteins SmF (8.5 kDa), -E (10 kDa), -D1 (12.5 kDa), -G (14 kDa), and -D2 (15 kDa), respectively. Furthermore, we found the trypanosome SmB (T. brucei) and SmD3 (Trypanosoma cruzi) homologues through database searches, thus completing a set of seven canonical Sm proteins. Sequence comparisons of the trypanosome proteins revealed several deviations in highly conserved positions from the Sm consensus motif. We have identified a network of specific heterodimeric and -trimeric Sm protein interactions in vitro. These results are summarized in a model of the trypanosome Sm core, which argues for a strong conservation of the Sm particle structure. The conservation extends also to the functional level, because at least one trypanosome Sm protein, SmG, was able to specifically complement a corresponding mutation in yeast.

dolichol-phosphate mannose	Dol-P-Man	Dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) is a key mannosyl donor for the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides as well as for O-linked oligosaccharides on yeast glycoproteins, and for the synthesis of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor found on many cell surface glycoproteins. It is synthesized by Dol-P-Man synthase which is the only glycosyltransferase in the dolichol pathway that has been expressed as an active protein, solubilized and purified in large enough quantities for structural investigations. Earlier studies showed that the enzyme is closely associated with membranes of endoplasmic reticulum with unique lipid requirements for its maximal activity. This potential target of antibiotic therapy is now being investigated at the molecular level to establish information about the structure of the enzyme as well as determine the nature and properties of the enzyme-phospholipid interactions. In this paper, we have determined the activities of the fluorescent labeled dolichyl-phosphate derivatives as well as the intramolecular distances between amino acid residues near the active site and/or the fluorophores of the substrate derivatives using fluorescence energy resonance transfer. These results also show that the conserved consensus sequence is not required by Dol-P-Man synthase neither for the recognition of Dol-P nor for the catalytic activity.
Imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase	IGPD	Imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) catalyses the dehydration of imidazole glycerol phosphate to imidazole acetol phosphate, an important late step in the biosynthesis of histidine. IGPD, isolated as a low molecular weight and inactive apo-form, assembles with specific divalent metal cations to form a catalytically active high molecular weight metalloenzyme. Oxo-vanadium ions also assemble the protein into, apparently, the same high molecular weight form but, uniquely, yield a protein without catalytic activity. The VO2+ derivative of IGPD has been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy. The spin Hamiltonian parameters indicate the presence of multiple 14N nuclei in the inner coordination sphere of VO2+ which is corroborated by ENDOR and ESEEM spectra showing resonances attributable to interactions with 14N nuclei. The isotropic superhyperfine coupling component of about 7 MHz determined by ENDOR is consistent with a nitrogen of coordinated histidine imidazole(s). The ESEEM Fourier-transform spectra further support the notion that the VO2+ substituted enzyme contains inner-sphere nitrogen ligands. The isotropic and anisotropic 14N superhyperfine coupling components are similar to those reported for other equatorially coordinated enzymatic histidine imidazole systems. ESEEM resonances from axial 14N ligands are discussed.

electron spin echo envelope modulation	ESEEM	Imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) catalyses the dehydration of imidazole glycerol phosphate to imidazole acetol phosphate, an important late step in the biosynthesis of histidine. IGPD, isolated as a low molecular weight and inactive apo-form, assembles with specific divalent metal cations to form a catalytically active high molecular weight metalloenzyme. Oxo-vanadium ions also assemble the protein into, apparently, the same high molecular weight form but, uniquely, yield a protein without catalytic activity. The VO2+ derivative of IGPD has been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy. The spin Hamiltonian parameters indicate the presence of multiple 14N nuclei in the inner coordination sphere of VO2+ which is corroborated by ENDOR and ESEEM spectra showing resonances attributable to interactions with 14N nuclei. The isotropic superhyperfine coupling component of about 7 MHz determined by ENDOR is consistent with a nitrogen of coordinated histidine imidazole(s). The ESEEM Fourier-transform spectra further support the notion that the VO2+ substituted enzyme contains inner-sphere nitrogen ligands. The isotropic and anisotropic 14N superhyperfine coupling components are similar to those reported for other equatorially coordinated enzymatic histidine imidazole systems. ESEEM resonances from axial 14N ligands are discussed.
trehalose-6-phosphate synthase	TPS	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TPS1-encoded trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) exerts an essential control on the influx of glucose into glycolysis, presumably by restricting hexokinase activity. Deletion of TPS1 results in severe hyperaccumulation of sugar phosphates and near absence of ethanol formation. To investigate whether trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) is the sole mediator of hexokinase inhibition, we have reconstituted ethanolic fermentation from glucose in permeabilized spheroplasts of the wild-type, tps1Delta and tps2Delta (Tre6P phosphatase) strains. For the tps1Delta strain, ethanol production was significantly lower and was associated with hyperaccumulation of Glu6P and Fru6P. A tps2Delta strain shows reduced accumulation of Glu6P and Fru6P both in intact cells and in permeabilized spheroplasts. These results are not consistent with Tre6P being the sole mediator of hexokinase inhibition. Reconstitution of ethanolic fermentation in permeabilized spheroplasts with glycolytic intermediates indicates additional target site(s) for the Tps1 control. Addition of Tre6P partially shifts the ethanol production rate and the metabolite pattern in permeabilized tps1Delta spheroplasts to those of the wild-type strain, but only with glucose as substrate. This is observed at a very high ratio of glucose to Tre6P. Inhibition of hexokinase activity by Tre6P is less efficiently counteracted by glucose in permeabilized spheroplasts compared to cell extracts, and this effect is largely abolished by deletion of TPS2 but not TPS1. In permeabilized spheroplasts, hexokinase activity is significantly lower in a tps2Delta strain compared to a wild-type strain and this difference is strongly reduced by additional deletion of TPS1. These results indicate that Tps1-mediated protein-protein interactions are important for control of glucose influx into yeast glycolysis, that Tre6P inhibition of hexokinase might not be competitive with respect to glucose in vivo and that also Tps2 appears to play a role in the control of hexokinase activity.

Skp1p-cullin-F-box	SCF	Skp1p-cullin-F-box (SCF) protein complexes are ubiquitin ligases required for degradation of many regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression, morphogenesis, and signal transduction. Using a genetic screen, we have isolated a novel allele of the HRT1/RBX1 gene in budding yeast (hrt1-C81Y). hrt1-C81Y mutant cells exhibited an aberrant morphology but were viable at all temperatures. The cells displayed multiple genetic interactions with mutations in known SCF components and were defective for the degradation of several SCF targets including Gic2p, Far1p, Sic1p, and Cln2p. In addition, they also failed to degrade the F-box proteins Grr1p, Cdc4p, and Met30p. Wild-type Hrt1p but not Hrt1p-C81Y was able to bind multiple F-box proteins in an F-box-dependent manner. Hrt1p-C81Y harbors a single mutation in its ring-finger domain, which is conserved in subunits of distinct E3 ligases. Finally, Hrt1p was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm and despite a short half-life was expressed constitutively throughout the cell cycle. Taken together, these results suggest that Hrt1p is a core subunit of multiple SCF complexes.
green fluorescent protein	GFP	The non-Mendelian element [URE3] of yeast is considered to be a prion form of the Ure2 protein. The [URE3] phenotype occurs at a frequency of 10(-5) in haploid yeast strains, is reversible, and its frequency is increased by overexpressing the URE2 gene. We created a new mutant of the Ure2 protein, called H2p, which results in a 1000-fold increase in the rate of [URE3] occurrence. To date, only the overexpression of various C-terminal truncated mutants of Ure2p gives rise to a comparable level. The h2 allele is, thus, the first characterized URE2 allele that induces prion formation when expressed at a low level. By shuffling mutated and wild-type domains of URE2, we also created the first mutant Ure2 protein that is functional and induces prion formation. We demonstrate that the domains of URE2 function synergistically in cis to induce [URE3] formation, which highlights the importance of intramolecular interactions in Ure2p folding. Additionally, we show using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein that the h2 allele exhibits numerous filiform structures that are not generated by the wild-type protein.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase epsil	pol epsilon	Subunit interactions within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon ) complex. Demonstration of a dimeric pol epsilon.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase epsil	pol epsilon	Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon) is essential for chromosomal replication. A major form of pol epsilon purified from yeast consists of at least four subunits: Pol2p, Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p. We have investigated the protein/protein interactions between these polypeptides by using expression of individual subunits in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The essential subunits, Pol2p and Dpb2p, interact directly in the absence of the other two subunits, and the C-terminal half of POL2, the only essential portion of Pol2p, is sufficient for interaction with Dpb2p. Dpb3p and Dpb4p, non-essential subunits, also interact directly with each other in the absence of the other two subunits. We propose that Pol2p.Dpb2p and Dpb3p.Dpb4p complexes interact with each other and document several interactions between individual members of the two respective complexes. We present biochemical evidence to support the proposal that pol epsilon may be dimeric in vivo. Gel filtration of the Pol2p.Dpb2p complexes reveals a novel heterotetrameric form, consisting of two heterodimers of Pol2p.Dpb2p. Dpb2p, but not Pol2p, exists as a homodimer, and thus the Pol2p dimerization may be mediated by Dpb2p. The pol2-E and pol2-F mutations that cause replication defects in vivo weaken the interaction between Pol2p and Dpb2p and also reduce dimerization of Pol2p. This suggests, but does not prove, that dimerization may also occur in vivo and be essential for DNA replication.
human liver monoamine oxidase A	MAO A	The FAD binding site of human liver monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) has been investigated by mutagenesis of the amino acid site of covalent FAD attachment (Cys-406) to an alanyl residue. Expression of the C406A mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in the formation of an active enzyme, as found previously with the rat liver enzyme. The activity of this mutant enzyme is labile to solubilization, thus requiring all experiments to be done with membrane preparations. C406A MAO A was expressed in a rib 5(-) strain of S. cerevisiae in the presence of 16 different riboflavin analogues. Inactive apoC406A MAO A is formed by induction of the enzyme in the absence of riboflavin. FAD but not FMN or riboflavin restores catalytic activity with an apparent K(d) of 62 +/- 5 nm. The results from both in vivo and in vitro reconstitution experiments show increased activity levels (up to approximately 7-fold higher) with those analogues exhibiting higher oxidation-reduction potentials than normal flavin and decreased activity levels with analogues exhibiting lower potentials. Analogues with substituents on the pyrimidine ring bind to C406A MAO A more weakly than normal FAD, suggesting specific interactions with the N(3) and N(1) positions. Analogues with substituents in the 7 and 8 positions bind to C406A MAO A with affinities comparable with that of normal FAD. These results are discussed in regard to functional significance of 8alpha-covalent binding of flavins to proteins.
triose phosphate isomerase	TIM	The denaturation of triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by guanidine hydrochlorids at pH 7.2 has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with optical spectroscopy. In the absence of denaturant, the hydrodynamic radius of 29.6(+/-0.25) A and the substantial chemical shift dispersion evident in the NMR spectrum are consistent with the highly structured dimeric native state of the protein. On the addition of 2. 2 M guanidine hydrochloride the effective hydrodynamic radius increases to 51.4(+/-0.43) A, consistent with that anticipated for the polypeptide chain in a highly unstructured random coil state. In 1.1 M guanidine hydrochloride, however, the effective hydrodynamic radius is 24.0(+/-0.25) A, a value substantially decreased relative to that of the native dimeric state but very close to that anticipated for a monomeric species with native-like compaction (23. 5 A). The lack of chemical shift dispersion indicates, however, that few tertiary interactions persist within this species. Far UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence measurements show that this compact intermediate retains significant secondary structure and that on average the fluorophores are partially excluded from solvent. Such a species could be important in the formation of dimeric TIM from its unfolded state. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
transmembrane conductance regulator	CFTR	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated Cl(-) channel that regulates other epithelial transport proteins by uncharacterized mechanisms. We employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the COOH-terminal 70 residues of CFTR to identify proteins that might be involved in such interactions. The alpha1 (catalytic) subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was identified as a dominant and novel interacting protein. The interaction is mediated by residues 1420-1457 in CFTR and by the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of alpha1-AMPK. Mutations of two protein trafficking motifs within the 38-amino acid region in CFTR each disrupted the interaction. GST-fusion protein pull-down assays in vitro and in transfected cells confirmed the CFTR-alpha1-AMPK interaction and also identified alpha2-AMPK as an interactor with CFTR. AMPK is coexpressed in CFTR-expressing cell lines and shares an apical distribution with CFTR in rat nasal epithelium. AMPK phosphorylated full-length CFTR in vitro, and AMPK coexpression with CFTR in XENOPUS: oocytes inhibited cAMP-activated CFTR whole-cell Cl(-) conductance by approximately 35-50%. Because AMPK is a metabolic sensor in cells and responds to changes in cellular ATP, regulation of CFTR by AMPK may be important in inhibiting CFTR under conditions of metabolic stress, thereby linking transepithelial transport to cell metabolic state.

integral endoplasmic reticulum	ER	In response to elevated levels of HMG-CoA reductase, an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, cells assemble novel ER arrays. These membranes provide useful models for exploration of ER structure and function, as well as general features of membrane biogenesis and turnover. Yeast express two functional HMG-CoA reductase isozymes, Hmg1p and Hmg2p, each of which induces morphologically different ER arrays. Hmg1p induces stacks of paired nuclear-associated membranes called karmellae. In contrast, Hmg2p induces peripheral ER membrane arrays and short nuclear-associated membrane stacks. In spite of their ability to induce different cellular responses, both Hmg1p and Hmg2p have similar structures, including a polytopic membrane domain containing eight predicted transmembrane helices. By examining a series of recombinant HMG-CoA reductase proteins, our laboratory previously demonstrated that the last ER-lumenal loop (Loop G) of the Hmg1p membrane domain contains a signal needed for proper karmellae assembly. Our goal was to examine the primary sequence requirements within Loop G that were critical for proper function of this signal. To this end, we randomly mutagenized the Loop G sequence, expressed the mutagenized Hmg1p in yeast, and screened for inability to generate karmellae at wild-type levels. Out of approximately 4000 strains with Loop G mutations, we isolated 57 that were unable to induce wild-type levels of karmellae assembly. Twenty-nine of these mutants contained one or more point mutations in the Loop G sequence, including nine single point mutants, four of which had severe defects in karmellae assembly. Comparison of these mutations to single point mutations that did not affect karmellae assembly did not reveal obvious patterns of sequence requirements. For example, both conservative and non-conservative changes were present in both groups and changes that altered the total charge of the Loop G region were observed in both groups. Our hypothesis is that Loop G serves as a karmellae-inducing signal by mediating protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions and that amino acids revealed by this analysis may be important for maintaining the proper secondary structure needed for these interactions.

nitrate reductase	NR	The proteins commonly referred to as 14-3-3s have recently come to prominence in the study of protein:protein interactions, having been shown to act as allosteric or steric regulators and possibly scaffolds. The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the regulatory phosphorylation site of nitrate reductase (NR) was studied in real-time by surface plasmon resonance, using primarily an immobilized synthetic phosphopeptide based on spinach NR-Ser543. Both plant and yeast 14-3-3 proteins were shown to bind the immobilized peptide ligand in a Mg2+-stimulated manner. Stimulation resulted from a reduction in KD and an increase in steady-state binding level (Req). As shown previously for plant 14-3-3s, fluorescent probes also indicated that yeast BMH2 interacted directly with cations, which bind and affect surface hydrophobicity. Binding of 14-3-3s to the phosphopeptide ligand occurred in the absence of divalent cations when the pH was reduced below neutral, and the basis for enhanced binding was a reduction in K(D). At pH 7.5 (+Mg2+), AMP inhibited binding of plant 14-3-3s to the NR based peptide ligand. The binding of AMP to 14-3-3s was directly demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis (plant), and from the observation that recombinant plant 14-3-3s have a low, but detectable, AMP phosphatase activity.
rat mineralocorticoid receptor activation function-1	AF-1	Characterization of transactivational property and coactivator mediation of rat mineralocorticoid receptor activation function-1 (AF-1).
autonomous activation function-2	AF-2	The autonomous activation function-2 (AF-2) in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) E/F domain is known to play a major role in the ligand-induced transactivation function of MR; however, it remained unclear about the transactivation function of its A/B domain. We therefore tried to characterize the MR A/B domain as the AF-1 and further studied the actions of known coactivators for AF-2 in the E/F ligand-binding domain in the function of the MR A/B domain. Deletion analyses of rat and human MRs revealed that the A/B domains harbor a transactivation function acting as AF-1. The MR mutant (E959Q) with a point mutation in helix 12, which causes a complete loss of MR AF-2 activity, still retained ligand-induced transactivation function, indicating a significant role for AF-1 in the full activity of the ligand-induced MR function. Among the coactivators tested to potentiate the MR AF-2, TIF2 and p300 potentiated the MR AF-1 through two different core regions [amino acids (a.a.) 1-169, a.a. 451-603] and exhibited functional interactions with the MR A/B domain in the cultured cells. However, such interactions were undetectable in a yeast and in an in vitro glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay, indicating that the functional interaction of TIF2 and p300 with the MR A/B domain to support the MR AF-1 activity require some unknown nuclear factor(s) or a proper modification of the A/B domain in the cells.

nuclear histone acetyltransferases	HATs	The assembly of eukaryotic DNA into folded nucleosomal arrays has drastic consequences for many nuclear processes that require access to the DNA sequence, including RNA transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Two types of highly conserved chromatin remodeling enzymes have been implicated as regulators of the repressive nature of chromatin structure: ATP-dependent remodeling complexes and nuclear histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Recent studies indicate that both types of enzymes can be recruited to chromosomal loci through either physical interactions with transcriptional activators or via the global accessibility of chromatin during S phase of the cell cycle. Here we review these recent observations and discuss the implications for gene-specific regulation by chromatin remodeling machines. Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
ATP-binding cassette	ABC	The Pdr5p multidrug ABC ("ATP-binding cassette) transporter was highly overexpressed in plasma membranes from a yeast strain exhibiting both pdr1-3 gain-of-function mutation in the transcription factor-encoding gene PDR1 and disruption of genes encoding other plasma membrane ABC transporters. Solubilized and purified Pdr5p displayed a tryptophan-characteristic intrinsic fluorescence, whose quenching was used to monitor interactions with substrates and effectors. The transporter exhibited a magnesium-dependent binding affinity for ATP and its fluorescent analogue 2'(3')-N-methylanthraniloyl-ATP, producing a marked fluorescence resonance-energy transfer. It also bound a series of known drug substrates and modulators. Interestingly, yeast Pdr5p interacted with flavonoids recently found to bind to cancer cell P-glycoprotein and to the protozoan parasite multidrug transporter. The extent of high-affinity binding of prenyl-flavonoids to purified Pdr5p was correlated to their efficiency to inhibit energy-dependent quenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence catalyzed by Pdr5p-enriched plasma membranes. The hydrophobic flavonoid derivative 6-(3, 3-dimethylallyl)galangin was the most efficient, with a K(i) of 0.18 microM for competitive inhibition of the MgATP-dependent quenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence. In contrast, inhibition of either ATP or UTP hydrolysis occurred at much higher concentrations and appeared to be noncompetitive. Prenyl-flavonoids therefore behave as potent inhibitors of drug binding to the yeast Pdr5p ABC transporter.
RNA polymerases	RNAPs	Eukaryotic nuclei contain three different types of RNA polymerases (RNAPs), each consisting of 12-18 different subunits. The evolutionarily highly conserved RNAP subunit RPB5 is shared by all three enzymes and therefore represents a key structural/functional component of all eukaryotic RNAPs. Here we present the crystal structure of the RPB5 subunit from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bipartite structure includes a eukaryote-specific N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain resembling the archaeal RNAP subunit H. RPB5 has been implicated in direct protein-protein contacts with transcription factor IIB, one of the components of the RNAP(II) basal transcriptional machinery, and gene-specific activator proteins, such as the hepatitis B virus transactivator protein X. The experimentally mapped regions of RPB5 involved in these interactions correspond to distinct and surface-exposed alpha-helical structures.
Ste12p DNA-binding domain	DBD	The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Ste12p is responsible for activating genes in response to MAP kinase cascades controlling mating and filamentous growth. Ste12p is negatively regulated by two inhibitor proteins, Dig1p (also called Rst1p) and Dig2p (also called Rst2p). The expression of a C-terminal Ste12p fragment (residues 216 to 688) [Ste12p(216-688)] from a GAL promoter causes FUS1 induction in a strain expressing wild-type STE12, suggesting that this region can cause the activation of endogenous Ste12p. Residues 262 to 594 are sufficient to cause STE12-dependent FUS1 induction when overexpressed, and this region of Ste12p was found to bind Dig1p but not Dig2p in yeast extracts. In contrast, recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Dig2p binds to the Ste12p DNA-binding domain (DBD). Expression of DIG2, but not DIG1, from a GAL promoter inhibits transcriptional activation by an Ste12p DBD-VP16 fusion. Furthermore, disruption of dig1, but not dig2, causes elevated transcriptional activation by a LexA-Ste12p(216-688) fusion. Ste12p has multiple regions within the C terminus (flanking residue 474) that can promote multimerization in vitro, and we demonstrate that these interactions can contribute to the activation of endogenous Ste12p by overproduced C-terminal fragments. These results demonstrate that Dig1p and Dig2p do not function by redundant mechanisms but rather inhibit pheromone-responsive transcription through interactions with separate regions of Ste12p.
yeast Gcn5p-containing histone acetyltransferas	HAT	We have investigated the structural basis for the differential catalytic function of the yeast Gcn5p-containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) A2 complex and free recombinant yeast Gcn5p (rGcn5p). HAT A2 is shown to be a unique complex that contains Gcn5p, Ada2p, and Ada3p, but not proteins specific to other related HAT A complexes, e.g. ADA, SAGA. Nevertheless, HAT A2 produces the same unique polyacetylation pattern of nucleosomal substrates reported previously for ADA and SAGA, demonstrating that proteins specific to the ADA and SAGA complexes do not influence the enzymatic activity of Gcn5p within the HAT A2 complex. To investigate the role of substrate interactions in the differential behavior of free and complexed Gcn5p, sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to characterize the binding of HAT A2 and free rGcn5p to intact and trypsinized nucleosomal arrays, H3/H4 tetramer arrays, and nucleosome core particles. We find that HAT A2 forms stable complexes with all nucleosomal substrates tested. In distinct contrast, rGcn5p does not interact stably with nucleosomal arrays, despite being able to specifically monoacetylate the H3 N terminus of nucleosomal substrates. Our data suggest that the ability of the HAT A2 complex to bind stably to nucleosomal arrays is functionally related to both local and global acetylation by the complexed and free forms of Gcn5p.

base pairs	bp	Bloom's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and predisposition to cancer. BLM, the gene defective in Bloom's syndrome, encodes a 159-kDa protein possessing DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activities. We have examined mechanistic aspects of the catalytic functions of purified recombinant BLM protein. Through analyzing the effects of different lengths of DNA cofactor on ATPase activity, we provide evidence to suggest that BLM translocates along single-stranded DNA in a processive manner. The helicase reaction catalyzed by BLM protein was examined as a function of duplex DNA length. We show that BLM catalyzes unwinding of short DNA duplexes (base pairs (bp)) but is severely compromised on longer DNA duplexes (>/=259-bp). The presence of the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (human replication protein A (hRPA)) stimulates the BLM unwinding reaction on the 259-bp partial duplex DNA substrate. Heterologous single-stranded DNA-binding proteins fail to stimulate similarly the helicase activity of BLM protein. This is the first demonstration of a functional interaction between BLM and another protein. Consistent with a functional interaction between hRPA and the BLM helicase, we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the two proteins mediated by the 70-kDa subunit of RPA. The interactions between BLM and hRPA suggest that the two proteins function together in vivo to unwind DNA duplexes during replication, recombination, or repair.

TATA box binding protein	TBP	The transcription factor TFIID contains the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here, the association of TFIID components with promoters that either are dependent on multiple TAFs (TAFdep) or have no apparent TAF requirement (TAFind) is analyzed in yeast. At TAFdep promoters, TAFs are present at levels comparable to that of TBP, whereas at TAFind promoters, TAFs are present at levels that approximate background. After inactivation of several general transcription factors, including TBP, TAFs are still recruited by activators to TAFdep promoters. The results reveal two classes of promoters: at TAFind promoters, TBP is recruited in the apparent absence of TAFs, whereas at TAFdep promoters, TAFs are co-recruited with TBP in a manner consistent with direct activator-TAF interactions.

ligand-dependent human estrogen receptor-alpha	hER alpha	The background of agonist/antagonist behaviour of the non-steroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is still not fully understood. Depending on cell type, its activities range from full agonistic to antagonistic in different tissues. We investigated the transactivational properties of tamoxifen in a basic yeast model system which reconstitutes ligand-dependent human estrogen receptor-alpha (hER alpha) gene activation. Tamoxifen exerted low agonist activity in this system compared to 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Efficiencies and potencies of several isomers were calculated by fitting experimental data with a logistic dose-response function. Cis-, trans- and cis-transtamoxifen and trans-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) showed comparable efficiencies and potencies in yeast. When subeffective doses of trans-, cis-/trans-, or trans-4-OH tamoxifen were combined with increasing 17 beta-estradiol concentrations, even a synergistic increase in efficiencies could be observed. Interestingly, the cis-isomer did not show this synergistic effect. Mutation of the N-terminus of the estrogen receptor changed the transactivational behaviour of tamoxifen and abolished the synergistic action with 17 beta-estradiol. Except for 4-OHT, the potencies of the investigated isomers, defined as ligand concentrations with half-maximal response, highly correlated with the binding affinities to hER alpha. Therefore, cis-, trans-, and cis-/trans-tamoxifen could be regarded as full agonists in yeast, while 4-OHT was regarded as a partial antagonist in yeast. Furthermore, these results indicate that the functional difference between trans-tamoxifen and trans-4-OHT is not due to their different affinities for the receptor protein.
receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase	RPTP	RPTPmu is a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) whose ectodomain mediates homotypic cell-cell interactions. The intracellular part of RPTPmu contains a relatively long juxtamembrane domain (158 amino acids; aa) and two conserved phosphatase domains (C1 and C2). The membrane-proximal C1 domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of RPTPmu, whereas the membrane-distal C2 domain serves an unknown function. The regulation of RPTP activity remains poorly understood, although dimerization has been proposed as a general mechanism of inactivation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we find that the C1 domain binds to an N-terminal noncatalytic region in RPTPmu, termed JM (aa 803-955), consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain (120 aa) and a small part of the C1 domain (33 aa). When co-expressed in COS cells, the JM polypeptide binds to both the C1 and the C2 domain. Strikingly, the isolated JM polypeptide fails to interact with either full-length RPTPmu or with truncated versions of RPTPmu that contain the JM region, consistent with the JM-C1 and JM-C2 interactions being intramolecular rather than intermolecular. Furthermore, we find that large part of the juxtamembrane domain (aa 814-922) is essential for C1 to be catalytically active. Our findings suggest a model in which RPTPmu activity is regulated by the juxtamembrane domain undergoing intramolecular interactions with both the C1 and C2 domain.
general control nonrepressed protein 5)	GCN5	We have used yeast genetics and in vitro protein-protein interaction experiments to explore the possibility that GCN5 (general control nonrepressed protein 5) and several other ADA (alteration/deficiency in activation) adaptor proteins of the multimeric SAGA complex can regulate T3/GRIP1 (glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1) and SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1) coactivator-dependent activation of transcription by the human T3 receptor beta1 (hTRbeta1). Here, we show that in vivo activation of a T3/GRIP1 or SRC-1 coactivator-dependent T3 hormone response element by hTRbeta1 is dependent upon the presence of yeast GCN5, ADA2, ADA1, or ADA3 adaptor proteins and that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains and bromodomain (BrD) of yGCN5 must be intact for maximal activation of transcription. We also observed that hTRbeta1 can bind directly to yeast or human GCN5 as well as hADA2, and that the hGCN5(387-837) sequence could bind directly to either GRIP1 or SRC-1 coactivator. Importantly, the T3-dependent binding of hTRbeta1 to hGCN5(387-837) could be markedly increased by the presence of GRIP1 or SRC1. Mutagenesis of GRIP1 nuclear receptor (NR) Box II and III LXXLL motifs also substantially decreased both in vivo activation of transcription and in vitro T3-dependent binding of hTRbeta1 to hGCN5. Taken together, these experiments support a multistep model of transcriptional initiation wherein the binding of T3 to hTRbeta1 initiates the recruitment of p160 coactivators and GCN5 to form a trimeric transcriptional complex that activates target genes through interactions with ADA/SAGA adaptor proteins and nucleosomal histones.

activator of transcription	STAT	Distinct roles of the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 (PIAS1) in cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction.
reciprocal Src homology 2 domain	SH2	STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation on cytokine stimulation. A tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT forms a functional dimer through reciprocal Src homology 2 domain (SH2)-phosphotyrosyl peptide interactions. IFN treatment induces the association of PIAS1 and Stat1, which results in the inhibition of Stat1-mediated gene activation. The molecular basis of the cytokine-dependent PIAS1-Stat1 interaction has not been understood. We report here that a region near the COOH terminus of PIAS1 (amino acids 392-541) directly interacts with the NH(2)-terminal domain of Stat1 (amino acids 1-191). A mutant PIAS1 lacking the Stat1-interacting domain failed to inhibit Stat1-mediated gene activation. By using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that PIAS1 specifically interacts with the Stat1 dimer, but not tyrosine-phosphorylated or -unphosphorylated Stat1 monomer. In addition, whereas the NH(2)-terminal region of PIAS1 does not interact with Stat1, it serves as a modulatory domain by preventing the interaction of the COOH-terminal domain of PIAS1 with the Stat1 monomer. Thus, the cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction is mediated through the specific recognition of the dimeric form of Stat1 by PIAS1.
initiation factor 2	eIF2B	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Composed of five subunits, it converts eIF2 from a GDP-bound form to the active eIF2-GTP complex. This is a regulatory step of translation initiation. In vitro, eIF2B catalytic function can be provided by the largest (epsilon) subunit alone (eIF2Bepsilon). This activity is stimulated by complex formation with the other eIF2B subunits. We have analyzed the roles of different regions of eIF2Bepsilon in catalysis, in eIF2B complex formation, and in binding to eIF2 by characterizing mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding eIF2Bepsilon (GCD6) that impair the essential function of eIF2B. Our analysis of nonsense mutations indicates that the C terminus of eIF2Bepsilon (residues 518 to 712) is required for both catalytic activity and interaction with eIF2. In addition, missense mutations within this region impair the catalytic activity of eIF2Bepsilon without affecting its ability to bind eIF2. Internal, in-frame deletions within the N-terminal half of eIF2Bepsilon disrupt eIF2B complex formation without affecting the nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2Bepsilon alone. Finally, missense mutations identified within this region do not affect the catalytic activity of eIF2Bepsilon alone or its interactions with the other eIF2B subunits or with eIF2. Instead, these missense mutations act indirectly by impairing the enhancement of the rate of nucleotide exchange that results from complex formation between eIF2Bepsilon and the other eIF2B subunits. This suggests that the N-terminal region of eIF2Bepsilon is an activation domain that responds to eIF2B complex formation.
heat shock transcription factor	HSF	In vitro DNA-binding assays demonstrate that the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adopt an altered conformation when stressed. This conformation, reflected in a change in electrophoretic mobility, requires that two HSF trimers be bound to DNA. Single trimers do not show this change, which appears to represent an alteration in the cooperative interactions between trimers. HSF isolated from stressed cells displays a higher propensity to adopt this altered conformation. Purified HSF can be stimulated in vitro to undergo the conformational change by elevating the temperature or by exposing HSF to superoxide anion. Mutational analysis maps a region critical for this conformational change to the flexible loop between the minimal DNA-binding domain and the flexible linker that joins the DNA-binding domain to the trimerization domain. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of the induction of the heat shock response by ischemic stroke, hypoxia, and recovery from anoxia, all known to stimulate the production of superoxide.
constitutive transport element	CTE	Vertebrate TAP and its yeast ortholog Mex67p are involved in the export of messenger RNAs from the nucleus. TAP has also been implicated in the export of simian type D viral RNAs bearing the constitutive transport element (CTE). Although TAP directly interacts with CTE-bearing RNAs, the mode of interaction of TAP/Mex67p with cellular mRNAs is different from that with the CTE RNA and is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. Here we show that Mex67p directly interacts with Yra1p, an essential yeast hnRNP-like protein. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved as Yra1p also interacts with TAP. Conditional expression in yeast cells implicates Yra1 p in the export of cellular mRNAs. Database searches revealed that Yra1p belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of hnRNP-like proteins having more than one member in Mus musculus, Xenopus laevis, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and at least one member in several species including plants. The murine members of the family directly interact with TAP. Because members of this protein family are characterized by the presence of one RNP-motif RNA-binding domain and exhibit RNA-binding activity, we called these proteins REF-bps for RNA and export factor binding proteins. Thus, Yra1p and members of the REF family of hnRNP-like proteins may facilitate the interaction of TAP/Mex67p with cellular mRNAs.
uncoupling proteins	UCPs	Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the superfamily of the mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MATP). Localized in the inner membrane of the organelle, they are postulated to be regulators of mitochondrial uncoupling. UCP2 and 3 may play an important role in the regulation of thermogenesis and, thus, on the resting metabolic rate in humans. To identify interacting proteins that may be involved in the regulation of the activity of UCPs, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied. Segments of hUCP2 containing the hydrophilic loops facing the intermembrane space, or combinations of these, were used to screen an adipocyte activation domain (AD) fusion library. The 14.3.3 protein isoforms theta, beta, zeta were identified as possible interacting partners of hUCP2. Screening of a human skeletal muscle AD fusion library, on the other hand, yielded several clones all of them encoding the gamma isoform of the 14.3.3 family. Mapping experiments further revealed that all these 14.3.3 proteins interact specifically with the C-terminal intermembrane space domain of both hUCP2 and hUCP3 whereas no interactions could be detected with the C-terminal part of hUCP1. Direct interaction between UCP3 and 14.3.3 theta could be demonstrated after in vitro translation by coimmunoprecipitation. When coexpressed in a heterologous yeast system, 14.3.3 proteins potentiated the inhibitory effect of UCP3 overexpression on cell growth. These findings suggest that 14.3.3 proteins could be involved in the targeting of UCPs to the mitochondria.

homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus	HECT	RSP5 is an essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was recently shown to form a physical and functional complex with RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II). The amino-terminal half of Rsp5 consists of four domains: a C2 domain, which binds membrane phospholipids; and three WW domains, which are protein interaction modules that bind proline-rich ligands. The carboxyl-terminal half of Rsp5 contains a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain that catalytically ligates ubiquitin to proteins and functionally classifies Rsp5 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. The C2 and WW domains are presumed to act as membrane localization and substrate recognition modules, respectively. We report that the second (and possibly third) Rsp5 WW domain mediates binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA pol II large subunit. The CTD comprises a heptamer (YSPTSPS) repeated 26 times and a PXY core that is critical for interaction with a specific group of WW domains. An analysis of synthetic peptides revealed a minimal CTD sequence that is sufficient to bind to the second Rsp5 WW domain (Rsp5 WW2) in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, we found that specific "imperfect" CTD repeats can form a complex with Rsp5 WW2. In addition, we have shown that phosphorylation of this minimal CTD sequence on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues acts as a negative regulator of the Rsp5 WW2-CTD interaction. In view of the recent data pertaining to phosphorylation-driven interactions between the RNA pol II CTD and the WW domain of Ess1/Pin1, we suggest that CTD dephosphorylation may be a prerequisite for targeted RNA pol II degradation.

nucleotide excision repair	NER	DNA damage formation and repair are tightly linked to protein-DNA interactions in chromatin. We have used minichromosomes in yeast as chromatin substrates in vivo to investigate how nucleotide excision repair (NER) and repair by DNA-photolyase (photoreactivation) remove pyrimidine dimers from an origin of replication ( ARS1 ). The ARS1 region is nuclease sensitive and flanked by nucleosomes on both sides. Photoreactivation was generally faster than NER at all sites. Site-specific heterogeneity of repair was observed for both pathways. This heterogeneity was different for NER and photoreactivation and it was altered in a minichromosome where ARS1 was transcribed. The results indicate distinct inter-actions of the repair systems with protein complexes bound in the ARS region (ORC, Abf1) and a predominant role of photolyase in CPD repair of an origin of replication.
X-ray cross-complementing group 1	XRCC1	XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing group 1) is a DNA repair protein that forms complexes with DNA polymerase beta (beta-Pol), DNA ligase III and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in the repair of DNA single strand breaks. The domains in XRCC1 have been determined, and characterization of the domain-domain interaction in the XRCC1-beta-Pol complex has provided information on the specificity and mechanism of binding. The domain structure of XRCC1, determined using limited proteolysis, was found to include an N-terminal domain (NTD), a central BRCT-I (breast cancer susceptibility protein-1) domain and a C-terminal BRCT-II domain. The BRCT-I-linker-BRCT-II C-terminal fragment and the linker-BRCT-II C-terminal fragment were relatively stable to proteolysis suggestive of a non-random conformation of the linker. A predicted inner domain was found not to be stable to proteolysis. Using cross-linking experiments, XRCC1 was found to bind intact beta-Pol and the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain. The XRCC1-NTD(1-183)(residues 1-183) was found to bind beta-Pol, the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain and the beta-Pol C-terminal palm-thumb (residues 140-335), and the interaction was further localized to XRCC1-NTD(1-157)(residues 1-157). The XRCC1-NTD(1-183)-beta-Pol 31 kDa domain complex was stable at high salt (1 M NaCl) indicative of a hydrophobic contribution. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, polypeptides expressed from two XRCC1 constructs, which included residues 36-355 and residues 1-159, were found to interact with beta-Pol, the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain, and the beta-Pol C-terminal thumb-only domain polypeptides expressed from the respective beta-Pol constructs. Neither the XRCC1-NTD(1-159), nor the XRCC1(36-355)polypeptide was found to interact with a beta-Pol thumbless polypeptide. A third XRCC1 polypeptide (residues 75-212) showed no interaction with beta-Pol. In quantitative gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, the XRCC1-NTD(1-183)was found to bind beta-Pol and its 31 kDa domain in a 1:1 complex with high affinity (K(d) of 0.4-2.4 microM). The combined results indicate a thumb-domain specific 1:1 interaction between the XRCC1-NTD(1-159)and beta-Pol that is of an affinity comparable to other binding interactions involving beta-Pol.
N-terminal domain	NTD	XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing group 1) is a DNA repair protein that forms complexes with DNA polymerase beta (beta-Pol), DNA ligase III and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in the repair of DNA single strand breaks.

The BRCT-I-linker-BRCT-II C-terminal fragment and the linker-BRCT-II C-terminal fragment were relatively stable to proteolysis suggestive of a non-random conformation of the linker. A predicted inner domain was found not to be stable to proteolysis. Using cross-linking experiments, XRCC1 was found to bind intact beta-Pol and the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain. The XRCC1-NTD(1-183)(residues 1-183) was found to bind beta-Pol, the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain and the beta-Pol C-terminal palm-thumb (residues 140-335), and the interaction was further localized to XRCC1-NTD(1-157)(residues 1-157). The XRCC1-NTD(1-183)-beta-Pol 31 kDa domain complex was stable at high salt (1 M NaCl) indicative of a hydrophobic contribution. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, polypeptides expressed from two XRCC1 constructs, which included residues 36-355 and residues 1-159, were found to interact with beta-Pol, the beta-Pol 31 kDa domain, and the beta-Pol C-terminal thumb-only domain polypeptides expressed from the respective beta-Pol constructs. Neither the XRCC1-NTD(1-159), nor the XRCC1(36-355)polypeptide was found to interact with a beta-Pol thumbless polypeptide. A third XRCC1 polypeptide (residues 75-212) showed no interaction with beta-Pol. In quantitative gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, the XRCC1-NTD(1-183)was found to bind beta-Pol and its 31 kDa domain in a 1:1 complex with high affinity (K(d) of 0.4-2.4 microM). The combined results indicate a thumb-domain specific 1:1 interaction between the XRCC1-NTD(1-159)and beta-Pol that is of an affinity comparable to other binding interactions involving beta-Pol.
beer cancer susceptibility protein-1)	BRCT-I	XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing group 1) is a DNA repair protein that forms complexes with DNA polymerase beta (beta-Pol), DNA ligase III and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in the repair of DNA single strand breaks. The domains in XRCC1 have been determined, and characterization of the domain-domain interaction in the XRCC1-beta-Pol complex has provided information on the specificity and mechanism of binding.

Ras recruitment system	RRS	Beta-catenin plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive genes by binding to TCF/LEF transcription factors. Although it has been suggested that the COOH-terminal region of beta-catenin functions as an activation domain, the mechanisms of activation remain unclear. To screen for potential transcriptional coactivators that bind to the COOH-terminal region of beta-catenin, we used a novel yeast two-hybrid system, the Ras recruitment system (RRS) that detects protein-protein interactions at the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Using this system, we isolated the CREB-binding protein (CBP). Armadillo (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of beta-catenin is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the CREB-binding domain of CBP. Beta-catenin synergizes with CBP to stimulate the activity of a synthetic reporter in vivo. Conversely, beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation is repressed by E1A, an antagonist of CBP function, but not by an E1A mutant that does not bind to CBP. The activation of Wnt target genes such as siamois and Xnr3 in Xenopus embryos is also sensitive to E1A. These findings suggest that CBP provides a link between beta-catenin and the transcriptional machinery, and possibly mediates the oncogenic function of beta-catenin.

dolichyl phosphate-mannose:protein O-mannosyltrans	Pmts	Protein O-mannosylation is an essential protein modification. It is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum by a family of dolichyl phosphate-mannose:protein O-mannosyltransferases (Pmts), which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pmt1p is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. ScPmt1p forms a complex with ScPmt2p that is required for maximum transferase activity. Recently, we proposed a seven-transmembrane structural model for ScPmt1p. A large, hydrophilic, endoplasmic reticulum-oriented segment is flanked by five amino-terminal and two carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domains. Based on this model, a structure-function analysis of ScPmt1p was performed. Deletion mutagenesis identified the N-terminal third of the transferase as being essential for the formation of a functional ScPmt1p-ScPmt2p complex. Deletion of the central hydrophilic loop eliminates mannosyltransferase activity, but not ScPmt1p-ScPmt2p interactions. Alignment of all fully characterized PMT family members revealed that this central loop region contains three highly conserved peptide motifs, which can be considered as signatures of the PMT family. In addition, a number of invariant amino acid residues were identified throughout the entire protein sequence. In order to evaluate the functional significance of these conserved residues site-directed mutagenesis was performed. We show that several amino acid substitutions in the conserved motifs significantly reduce ScPmt1p activity. Further, the invariant residues Arg-64, Glu-78, Arg-138, and Leu-408 are essential for ScPmt1p function. In particular, Arg-138 is crucial for ScPmt1p-ScPmt2p complex formation.
Cyclin-dependent kinases	CDKs	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are important regulators of the eukaryotic cell division cycle. To study protein-protein interactions involving plant CDKs, the Arabidopsis thaliana Cdc2aAt was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report on the isolation of ICK2, and show that it interacts with Cdc2aAt, but not with a second CDK from Arabidopsis, Cdc2bAt. ICK2 contains a carboxy-terminal domain related to that of ICK1, a previously described CDK inhibitor from Arabidopsis, and to the CDK-binding domain of the mammalian inhibitor p27Kip1. Outside of this domain, ICK2 is distinct from ICK1, p27Kip1, and other proteins. At nanogram levels (8 nM), purified recombinant ICK2 inhibits p13Suc1-associated histone H1 kinase activity from Arabidopsis tissue extracts, demonstrating that it is a potent inhibitor of plant CDK activity in vitro. ICK2 mRNA was present in all tissues analysed by Northern hybridization, and its distribution was distinct from that of ICK1. These results demonstrate that plants possess a family of differentially regulated CDK inhibitors that contain a conserved carboxy terminal but with distinct amino terminal regions.
GDP dissociation inhibitor	GDI	Ara4, a member of the Rab/Ypt GTPase family derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, causes severe growth inhibition when expressed in several yeast ypt mutants. Mutational analysis of ARA4 indicated that the Ara4 protein titrates at least three factors in yeast, including the GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). The coexpression of AtGDI1 (Arabidopsis GDI) suppressed the growth defect caused by Ara4 in yeast ypt1, suggesting that Ara4 and AtGDI1 interact in yeast to compensate for the titration of yeast GDI. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library for other suppressors that may also interact with Ara4 physiologically. A novel suppressor, SAY1, encoded a hydrophilic protein with two putative coiled-coil regions, which showed partial similarity to the yeast Vps27 protein. To understand the structural requirements of Ara4 for interacting with these molecules, we examined whether AtGDI1 and SAY1 could suppress the growth defect of ypt1 caused by various mutant versions of ARA4. The results indicated that the interaction between Ara4 and AtGDI1 depends on the conserved C-terminal Cys-motif and Thr44 in the effector domain of Ara4. In contrast, neither of these motifs is necessary for the interaction between Say1 and Ara4. This approach provides a powerful method to dissect complex interactions between a GTPase and its regulators.
glycoprotein	HRP	In studies of phagocytosis there is a need to distinguish targets that are internalized by the cell from those that are bound to the cell surface. The present work describes a simple method by which internalized and surface-bound yeast particles can be identified by differential interference contrast microscopy, using trypan blue to stain surface-bound yeast particles. The method has the advantage that both internalized and surface-bound particles can be visualized without the need to switch the illumination source and/or filter sets, thus facilitating concurrent quantitation of binding and internalization. The method was evaluated with the phagocytosis-modulating agents horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and cytochalasin D, using adherent resident macrophages as phagocytic cells. When macrophages are challenged with a particular type of target, they usually bind many more targets than they ingest. It was shown that yeast particles were arrested in the initial binding phase of phagocytosis depending on the region of macrophage plasma membrane where binding sites were formed. Failure of surface-bound yeast particles to trigger internalization was not due to modifications of the yeast particle surface. Nor was it due to binding to non-phagocytic receptors, or low-affinity receptor-ligand interactions. The glycoprotein HRP inhibited only the binding stage of phagocytosis, whereas cytochalasin D, a drug that affects actin polymerization, inhibited both binding and internalization. However, when the yeast particles were pre-incubated in fresh mouse serum, cytochalasin D inhibited only the internalization step. The assay described here may be useful in studies concerned with the function and expression of phagocytosis-mediating surface lectins.
Expanded bed adsorption	EBA	Expanded bed adsorption (EBA) is a primary recovery operation allowing the adsorption of proteins directly from unclarified feedstock, e.g. culture suspensions, homogenates or crude extracts. Thus solid-liquid separation is combined with adsorptive purification in a single step. The concept of integration requires that the solid components of the feed solution are regarded as a part of the process, which influences stability, reproducibility, and overall performance. This aspect is investigated here at the example of the influence of presence and concentration of intact yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) on the adsorption of model proteins (hen egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin) to various stationary phases (cation and anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, immobilised metal affinity). The interaction of the cells with the adsorbents is determined qualitatively and quantitatively by a pulse response method as well as by a finite bath technique under different operating conditions. The consequence of these interactions for the stability of expanded beds in suspensions of varying cell concentration is measured by residence time distributions (RTDs) after tracer pulse injection (NaBr, LiCl). Analysis of the measured RTD by the PDE model allows the calculation of the fraction of perfectly fluidised bed (phi), a parameter which may be regarded as a critical quantity for the estimation of the quality of fluidisation of adsorbents in cell containing suspensions. The correlation between bed stability and performance is made by analysing the breakthrough of model proteins during adsorption from unclarified yeast culture broth. A clear relationship is found between the degree of cell/adsorbent interaction, bed stability in terms of the phi parameter, and the sorption efficiency. Only beds characterised by a phi value larger than 0.8 in the presence of cells will show a conserved performance compared to adsorption from cell free solutions. A drop in phi, which is due to interactions of the fluidised adsorbent particles with cells from the feed, will directly result in a reduced breakthrough efficiency. The data presented highlight the importance of including the potential interaction of solid feedstock components and the expanded adsorbents into the design of EBA processes, as the interrelation found here is a key factor for the overall performance of EBA as a truly integrated operation.

hepatitis B virus X protein	HBV	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a unique fourth open reading frame coding for a 16.5-kDa protein known as hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX). The importance of HBX in the life cycle of HBV has been well established, but the underlying molecular function of HBX remains controversial. We previously identified a proteasome subunit PSMA7 that interacts specifically with HBX in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. Here we demonstrate that PSMC1, an ATPase-like subunit of the 19 S proteasome component, also interacts with HBX and PSMA7. Analysis of the interacting domains among PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBX by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis suggested a mutually competitive structural relationship among these polypeptides. The competitive nature of these interactions is further demonstrated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. The crucial HBX sequences involved in interaction with PSMA7 and PSMC1 are important for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. HBX, while functioning as a coactivator of AP-1 and acidic activator VP-16 in mammalian cells, had no effect on the transactivation function of their functional orthologs GCN4 and Gal4 in yeast. Overexpression of PSMC1 seemed to suppress the expression of various reporters in mammalian cells; this effect, however, was overcome by coexpression of HBX. In addition, HBX expression inhibited the cellular turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin-Arg-beta-galactosidase, two well known substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, interaction of HBX with the proteasome complex in metazoan cells may underlie the functional basis of proteasome as a cellular target of HBX.

mammalian phospholipase C-beta	PLC-beta	Among the phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, four mammalian phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) isotypes (isotypes 1-4) are activated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although the regulation of the PLC-betas by GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular determinants that regulate their activity. The PLC-beta isozymes carry a putative PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif (X(S/T)X(V/L)COOH) at their carboxyl terminus, which is implicated in specific interactions with anchor proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) as a protein that interacted with a C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-beta3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NHERF2 interacts specifically with PLC-beta3, but not with other PLC-beta isotypes. Furthermore, PLC-beta3 interacted with NHERF2 rather than with other PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction required the COOH-terminal NTQL sequence of PLC-beta3 and the second PDZ domain of NHERF2. Interestingly, NHERF2 potentiated the PLC-beta activation by carbachol in COS7 and HeLa cells, while mutant NHERF2, lacking the second PDZ domain, had no such effect. Taken together, the data suggest that NHERF2 may act as a modulator underlying the process of PLC-beta3-mediated signaling.

MluI cell-cycle box	MCB	The minimal DNA-binding domains of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Mbp1 and Swi4 have been identified and their DNA binding properties have been investigated by a combination of methods. An approximately 100 residue region of sequence homology at the N-termini of Mbp1 and Swi4 is necessary but not sufficient for full DNA binding activity. Unexpectedly, nonconserved residues C-terminal to the core domain are essential for DNA binding. Proteolysis of Mbp1 and Swi4 DNA-protein complexes has revealed the extent of these sequences, and C-terminally extended molecules with substantially enhanced DNA binding activity compared to the core domains alone have been produced. The extended Mbp1 and Swi4 proteins bind to their cognate sites with similar affinity [K(A) approximately (1-4) x 10(6) M(-)(1)] and with a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, alanine substitution of two lysine residues (116 and 122) within the C-terminal extension (tail) of Mbp1 considerably reduces the apparent affinity for an MCB (MluI cell-cycle box) containing oligonucleotide. Both Mbp1 and Swi4 are specific for their cognate sites with respect to nonspecific DNA but exhibit similar affinities for the SCB (Swi4/Swi6 cell-cycle box) and MCB consensus elements. Circular dichroism and (1)H NMR spectroscopy reveal that complex formation results in substantial perturbations of base stacking interactions upon DNA binding. These are localized to a central 5'-d(C-A/G-CG)-3' region common to both MCB and SCB sequences consistent with the observed pattern of specificity. Changes in the backbone amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts upon DNA binding have enabled us to experimentally define a DNA-binding surface on the core N-terminal domain of Mbp1 that is associated with a putative winged helix-turn-helix motif. Furthermore, significant chemical shift differences occur within the C-terminal tail of Mbp1, supporting the notion of two structurally distinct DNA-binding regions within these proteins.

guanine nucleotide exchange factor	GEF	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras proteins. Its catalytic domain is highly homologous to Ras-GEFs from all eukaryotes. Even though Cdc25 is the first Ras-GEF identified in any organism, we still know very little about how its function is regulated in yeast. In this work we provide evidence for the involvement of the N terminus of Cdc25 in the regulation of its activity. A truncated CDC25 lacking the noncatalytic C-terminal coding sequence was identified in a screen of high-copy suppressors of the heat-shock-sensitive phenotype of strains in which the Ras pathway is hyper-activated. The truncated gene acts as a dominant-negative mutant because it only suppresses the heat-shock sensitivity of strains that require the function of CDC25. Our two-hybrid assays and immunoprecipitation analyses show interactions between the N terminus of Cdc25 and itself, the C terminus, and the full-length protein. These results suggest that the dominant-negative effect may be a result of oligomerization with endogenous Cdc25. Further evidence of the role of the N terminus of Cdc25 in the regulation of its activity is provided by the mapping of the activating mutation of CDC25HS20 to the serine residue at position 365 in the noncatalytic N-terminal domain. This mutation induces a phenotype similar to activating mutants of other genes in the Ras pathway in yeast. Hence, the N terminus may exert a negative control on the catalytic activity of the protein. Taken together these results suggest that the N terminus plays a crucial role in regulating Cdc25 and consequently Ras activity, which in S. cerevisiae is essential for cell cycle progression.
ABI3-interacting proteins	AIPs	The ABI3 locus is a major regulator of embryo development in Arabidopsis and is essential for the simultaneous activation of the maturation pathway, as well as repression of germination and seedling development. We used a two-hybrid screen in yeast in order to identify proteins that interact with ABI3. Four ABI3-interacting proteins (AIPs) were identified which showed specific in vivo and in vitro interactions with the C-terminal region of ABI3 that contains the B2 and B3 domains, previously shown to have DNA binding activity. The expression characteristics of the genes encoding the AIPs have also been analysed in wild-type and abi3, lec1 and fus3 embryo mutants. This analysis demonstrated differential expression of these genes during normal embryo development and in the mutant lines. All the AIPs show homology to existing transcription factors and therefore they may function with ABI3 within the network of transcriptional regulators that control embryo development in Arabidopsis.
Expanded bed adsorption	EBA	Expanded bed adsorption (EBA) is an integrated technology for the primary recovery of proteins from unclarified feedstock. A method is presented which allows a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the main mechanisms governing the interaction of biomass with fluidized resins. A pulse response technique was used to determine the adsorption of various cell types (yeast, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, mammalian cells and yeast homogenate) to a range of commercially available matrices for EBA. Cells and cell debris were found to interact with the ligands of agarose based resins mainly by electrostatic forces. From the adsorbents investigated the anion exchange matrix showed the most severe interactions, while cation exchange and affinity adsorbents appeared to be less affected. Within the range of biologic systems under study E. coli cells had the lowest tendency of binding to all matrices while hybridoma cells attached to all the adsorbents except the protein A affinity matrix. The method presented may be employed for screening of suitable biomass/adsorbent combinations, which yield a robust and reliable initial capture step by expanded bed adsorption from unclarified feedstock.
cyclin B	Clb	We screened for mutations that resulted in lethality when the G1 cyclin Cln2p was overexpressed throughout the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in five complementation groups were found to give this phenotype, and three of the mutated genes were identified as MEC1, NUP170, and CDC14. Mutations in CDC14 may have been recovered in the screen because Cdc14p may reduce the cyclin B (Clb)-associated Cdc28 kinase activity in late mitosis, and Cln2p may normally activate Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity by related mechanisms. In agreement with the idea that cdc14 mutations elevate Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity, deletion of the gene for the Clb-Cdc28 inhibitor Sic1 caused synthetic lethality with cdc14-1, as did the deletion of HCT1, which is required for proteolysis of Clb2p. Surprisingly, deletion of the gene for the major B-type cyclin, CLB2, also caused synthetic lethality with the cdc14-1 mutation. The clb2 cdc14 strains arrested with replicated but unseparated DNA and unseparated spindle pole bodies; this phenotype is distinct from the late mitotic arrest of the sic1::TRP1 cdc14-1 and the cdc14-1 hct1::LEU2 double mutants and of the cdc14 CLN2 overexpressor. We found genetic interactions between CDC14 and the replication initiator gene CDC6, extending previous observations of interactions between the late mitotic function of Cdc14p and control of DNA replication. We also describe genetic interactions between CDC28 and CDC14.
homeodomain-leucine zipper	HD-Zip	Proteins of the closely related homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) families I and II in plants are putative transcription factors that interact with similar pseudopalindromic DNA recognition sites. We have previously described the Oshox1 gene from rice, which encodes an HD-Zip II protein. To identify further rice HD-Zip proteins, one-hybrid screens were performed in yeast strains containing a HIS3 reporter gene with upstream HD-Zip recognition sites. This resulted in the isolation of six new cDNAs encoding HD-Zip proteins belonging to family I (Oshox4, -5, -6) or family II (Oshox2, -3, -7). In transient assays, using rice suspension-cultured cells transformed by particle bombardment, we showed previously that Oshox1 can transcriptionally repress the activity of reporter gene constructs with upstream HD-Zip binding sites. Here, we confirm the repression properties of Oshox1 by showing that the repression function can be conferred on a heterologous DNA-binding domain. This portable functional domain (residues 1-155) is located proximal to the HD-Zip domain. In yeast, the same region of the Oshox1 protein was found to confer transcriptional activation instead of repression, pointing to the possibility that cell type-specific factors may determine the functional properties of the Oshox1 protein in rice. Like Oshox1, another HD-Zip family II protein (Oshox3) was also found to function as a transcriptional repressor in rice cells. In contrast, two HD-Zip I family proteins (Oshox4 and -5) appeared to act as activators in both rice and yeast cells. Results of two-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that all HD-Zip proteins of families I and II can form homodimers and also heterodimers with all HD-Zip proteins of the same family. Heterodimerization across the HD-Zip families I and II apparently does not to occur.
hepatitis C virus	HCV	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes severe liver disease, including liver cancer. A vaccine preventing HCV infection has not yet been developed, and, given the increasing number of infected people, this virus is now considered a major public-health problem. The HCV genome is a plus-stranded RNA that encodes a single polyprotein processed into at least 10 mature polypeptides. So far, only the interaction between the protease NS3 and its cofactor, NS4A, which is involved in the processing of the non-structural region, has been extensively studied. Our work was aimed at constructing a protein interaction map of HCV. A classical two-hybrid system failed to detect any interactions between mature HCV polypeptides, suggesting incorrect folding, expression or targetting of these proteins. We therefore developed a two-hybrid strategy, based on exhaustive screens of a random genomic HCV library. Using this method, we found known interactions, such as the capsid homodimer and the protease dimer, NS3-NS4A, as well as several novel interactions such as NS4A-NS2. Thus, our results are consistent with the idea that the use of a random genomic HCV library allows the selection of correctly folded viral protein fragments. Interacting domains of the viral polyprotein are identified, opening the possibility of developing specific anti-viral agents, based on their ability to modulate these interactions.
replication protein A	RPA	Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA binding protein whose role in DNA replication, recombination and repair has been mainly elucidated through in vitro biochemical studies utilizing the mammalian complex. However, the identification of homologs of all three subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers the opportunity of examining the in vivo role of RPA. In our laboratory, we have previously isolated a missense allele of the RFA1 gene, encoding the p70 subunit of the RPA complex. Strains containing this mutant allele, rfa1-D228Y, display increased levels of direct-repeat recombination, decreased levels of heteroallelic recombination, UV sensitivity and a S-phase delay. In this study, we have characterized further the role of RPA by screening other replication and repair mutants for a synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with the rfa1-D228Y allele. Among the replication mutants examined, only one displayed a synthetic lethal phenotype, pol12-100, a conditional allele of the B subunit of pol alpha-primase. In addition, a delayed senescence phenotype was observed in raf1-D228Y strains containing a null mutation of HDF1, the S. cerevisiae homolog of the 70 kDa subunit of Ku. Interestingly, a synergistic reduction in telomere length observed in the double mutants suggests that the shortening of telomeres may be the cause of the decreased viability in these strains. Furthermore, this result represents the first evidence of a role for RPA in telomere maintenance.
nuclear pore complex	NPC	The interactions between transport receptors and proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) are fundamental to understanding nucleocytoplasmic transport. In order to delineate the path that a particular transport receptor takes through the NPC, we have employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (ECFP, EYFP) in living cells. A panel of yeast strains expressing functional receptor--ECFP and nucleoporin--EYFP fusions has been analyzed with a FRET assay. With this approach, we define points of contact in the NPC for the related importin Pse1/Kap121 and exportin Msn5. These data demonstrate the utility of FRET in mapping dynamic protein interactions in a genetic system. Furthermore, the data indicate that an importin and exportin have overlapping pathways through the NPC.

hnRNP K-homology	KH	Scp160p is a 160 kDa protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains 14 repeats of the hnRNP K-homology (KH) domain, and demonstrates significant sequence homology to a family of proteins collectively known as vigilins. As a first step towards defining the function of Scp160p, we have characterized the subcellular distribution and in vivo interactions of this protein. Using sucrose gradient fractionation studies we have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is predominantly associated with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we have found that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes by EDTA in the form of a large complex of> or =1300 kDa that is sensitive both to RNase and NaCl. Using affinity-chromatography to isolate these complexes, we have identified two protein components other than Scp160p: poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p confirms these complexes to be mRNPs. The presence of Bfr1p is intriguing because the null phenotype for this gene is essentially the same as that reported for scp160 -null cells: increased cell size and aberrant DNA content. These results demonstrate that Scp160p associates with polyribosome-bound mRNP complexes in vivo, implicating a role for this protein in one or more levels of mRNA metabolism in yeast.
cooperative interactions among transcription factors	TFs	MOTIVATION: The question addressed here is how cooperative interactions among transcription factors (TFs), a very frequent phenomenon in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, can be used to identify genes that are regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificities. Cooperativity may be homotypic, involving binding of only one transcription factor to multiple sites in a gene's regulatory region. It may also be heterotypic, involving binding of more than one TF. Both types of cooperativity have in common that the binding sites for the respective TFs form tightly linked 'clusters', groups of binding sites often more closely associated than expected by chance alone. RESULTS: A statistical technique suitable for the identification of statistically significant homotypic or heterotypic TF binding site clusters in whole eukaryotic genomes is presented. It can be used to identify genes likely to be regulated by the TFs. Application of the technique is illustrated with two transcription factors involved in the cell cycle and mating control of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that the results obtained are biologically meaningful. This rapid and inexpensive computational method of generating hypotheses about gene regulation thus generates information that may be used to guide subsequent costly and laborious experimental approaches, and that may aid in the assignment of biological functions to putative open reading frames.
oligosaccharyl transferase	OT	In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oligosaccharyl transferase (OT), which catalyzes the transfer of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide chains to nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, consists of nine nonidentical membrane protein subunits. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated these nine proteins exist in three subcomplexes. Three of the OT subunits (Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p) have been proposed to exist in one subcomplex. To investigate the interaction of these three membrane proteins, initially we carried out a mutational analysis of Ost4p, which is an extraordinarily small membrane protein containing only 36 amino acid residues. This analysis indicated that when single amino acid residues in a region close to the luminal face of the putative transmembrane domain of Ost4p were changed into an ionizable amino acid such as Lys or Asp, growth at 37 degrees C and OT activity measured in vitro were impaired. In addition, using immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blot analysis, we found that with these mutations the interaction between Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p was disrupted. Introduction of Lys or Asp residues at other positions in the putative transmembrane domain or at the N or C terminus of Ost4p had no effect on disrupting subunit interactions or impairing the activity of OT. These findings suggest that a localized region of the putative transmembrane domain of Ost4p mediates in stabilization of the interaction with the two other OT subunits (Ost3p and Stt3p) in a subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
nitric oxide	NO	The interaction of nitric oxide (NO) with the yeast transcription factor Ace1: A model system for NO-protein thiol interactions with implications to metal metabolism.
Nitric oxide	NO	Nitric oxide (NO) was found to inhibit the copper-dependent induction of the yeast CUP1 gene. This effect is attributable to an inhibition of the copper-responsive CUP1 transcriptional activator Ace1. A mechanism is proposed whereby the metal binding thiols of Ace1 are chemically modified via NO- and O(2)-dependent chemistry, thereby diminishing the ability of Ace1 to bind and respond to copper. Moreover, it is proposed that demetallated Ace1 is proteolytically degraded in the cell, resulting in a prolonged inhibition of copper-dependent CUP1 induction. These findings indicate that NO may serve as a disrupter of yeast copper metabolism. More importantly, considering the similarity of Ace1 to other mammalian metal-binding proteins, this work lends support to the hypothesis that NO may regulate/disrupt metal homeostasis under both normal physiological and pathophysiological circumstances.
double strand break	DSB	Spo11p is a key mediator of interhomolog interactions during meiosis. Deletion of the SPO11 gene decreases the length of S phase by approximately 25%. Rec8p is a key coordinator of meiotic interhomolog and intersister interactions. Deletion of the REC8 gene increases S-phase length, by approximately 10% in wild-type and approximately 30% in a spo11Delta background. Thus, the progression of DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins. The spo11-Y135F DSB (double strand break) catalysis-defective mutant is normal for S-phase modulation and DSB-independent homolog pairing but is defective for later events, formation of DSBs, and synaptonemal complexes. Thus, earlier and later functions of Spo11 are defined. We propose that meiotic S-phase progression is linked directly to development of specific chromosomal features required for meiotic interhomolog interactions and that this feedback process is built upon a more fundamental mechanism, common to all cell types, by which S-phase progression is coupled to development of nascent intersister connections and/or related aspects of chromosome morphogenesis. Roles for Rec8 and/or Spo11 in progression through other stages of meiosis are also revealed.
movement protein NSm of tomato spotted wilt tospovirus	TSWV	The movement protein NSm of tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV): RNA binding, interaction with the TSWV N protein, and identification of interacting plant proteins.
tomato spotted wilt tospovirus	TSWV	The nonstructural NSm protein of tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) represents a putative viral movement protein involved in cell-to-cell movement of nonenveloped ribonucleocapsid structures. To study the molecular basis of NSm function, we expressed the protein in Escherichia coli and investigated protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of NSm protein in vitro. NSm specifically interacts with TSWV N protein and binds single-stranded RNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner. Using NSm as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified two homologous NSm-binding proteins of the DnaJ family from Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana.
apurinic/apyrimidinic site	AP	The Ogg1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to a family of DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP) lyases, the signature of which is the alpha-helix-hairpin-alpha-helix-Gly/Pro-Asp (HhH-GPD) active site motif together with a conserved catalytic lysine residue, to which we refer as the HhH-GPD/K family. In the yeast Ogg1 protein, yOgg1, the HhH-GPD/K motif spans residues 225-260 and the conserved lysine is K241. In this study, we have purified the K241R and K241Q mutant proteins and compared their catalytic and DNA binding properties to that of the wild-type yOgg1. The results show that the K241R mutation greatly impairs both the DNA glycosylase and the AP lyase activities of yOgg1. Specificity constants for cleavage of a 34mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-OxoG) paired with a cytosine, [8-OxoG.C], are 56 x 10(-)(3) and 5 x 10(-)(3) min(-)(1) nM(-)(1) for the wild-type and the K241R protein, respectively. On the other hand, the K241Q mutation abolishes the DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities of yOgg1. In contrast, the K241R and K241Q proteins have conserved wild-type DNA binding properties. K(dapp) values for binding of [8-OxoG.C] are 6.9, 7.4, and 4.8 nM for the wild-type, K241R, and K241Q proteins, respectively. The results also show that AP site analogues such as 1, 3-propanediol (Pr), tetrahydrofuran (F), or cyclopentanol (Cy) are not substrates but constitute good inhibitors of the wild-type yOgg1. Therefore, we have used a 59mer [Pr.C] duplex to further analyze the DNA binding properties of the wild-type, K241R, and K241Q proteins. Hydroxyl radical footprints of the wild-type yOgg1 show strong protection of six nucleotides centered around the Pr lesion in the damaged strand. On the complementary strand, only the cytosine placed opposite Pr was strongly protected. The same footprints were observed with the K241R and K241Q proteins, confirming their wild-type DNA binding properties. These results indicate that the K241Q mutant protein can be used to study interactions between yOgg1 and DNA containing metabolizable substrates such as 8-OxoG or an AP site.

polyadenylation-inhibitory element	PIE	It was previously shown that the human U1A protein, one of three U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-specific proteins, autoregulates its own production by binding to and inhibiting the polyadenylation of its own pre-mRNA. The U1A autoregulatory complex requires two molecules of U1A protein to cooperatively bind a 50-nucleotide polyadenylation-inhibitory element (PIE) RNA located in the U1A 3' untranslated region. Based on both biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural data, it was predicted that protein-protein interactions between the N-terminal regions (amino acids [aa] 1 to 115) of the two U1A proteins would form the basis for cooperative binding to PIE RNA and for inhibition of polyadenylation. In this study, we not only experimentally confirmed these predictions but discovered some unexpected features of how the U1A autoregulatory complex functions. We found that the U1A protein homodimerizes in the yeast two-hybrid system even when its ability to bind RNA is incapacitated. U1A dimerization requires two separate regions, both located in the N-terminal 115 residues. Using both coselection and gel mobility shift assays, U1A dimerization was also observed in vitro and found to depend on the same two regions that were found in vivo. Mutation of the second homodimerization region (aa 103 to 115) also resulted in loss of inhibition of polyadenylation and loss of cooperative binding of two U1A protein molecules to PIE RNA. This same mutation had no effect on the binding of one U1A protein molecule to PIE RNA. A peptide containing two copies of aa 103 to 115 is a potent inhibitor of polyadenylation. Based on these data, a model of the U1A autoregulatory complex is presented.

scaled particle theory	SPT	Examining solute-induced changes in protein conformational equilibria is a long-standing method for probing the role of water in maintaining protein stability. Interpreting the molecular details governing the solute-induced effects, however, remains controversial. We present experimental and theoretical data for osmolyte-induced changes in the stabilities of the A and N states of yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c. Using polyol osmolytes of increasing size, we observe that osmolytes alone induce A-state formation from acid-denatured cytochrome c and N state formation from the thermally denatured protein. The stabilities of the A and N states increase linearly with osmolyte concentration. Interestingly, osmolytes stabilize the A state to a greater degree than the N state. To interpret the data, we divide the free energy for the reaction into contributions from nonspecific steric repulsions (excluded volume effects) and from binding interactions. We use scaled particle theory (SPT) to estimate the free energy contributions from steric repulsions, and we estimate the contributions from water-protein and osmolyte-protein binding interactions by comparing the SPT calculations to experimental data. We conclude that excluded volume effects are the primary stabilizing force, with changes in water-protein and solute-protein binding interactions making favorable contributions to stability of the A state and unfavorable contributions to the stability of the N state. The validity of our interpretation is strengthened by analysis of data on osmolyte-induced protein stabilization from the literature, and by comparison with other analyses of solute-induced changes in conformational equilibria.

RNA-binding	Spnr	We have identified a 74 kDa double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding protein that shares extensive homology with the mouse spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding (Spnr) protein. p74 contains two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) that are essential for preferential binding to dsRNA. Previously, dsRNA-binding proteins were shown to undergo homo- and heterodimerization, raising the possibility that regulation of activity could be controlled by interactions between different family members. Homodimerization is required to activate the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, whereas hetero-dimerization between PKR and other dsRNA-binding proteins can inhibit kinase activity. We have found that p74 also interacts with PKR, both the wild-type enzyme and a catalytically defective mutant (K296R). While co-expression of p74 and wild-type PKR in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not alter PKR activity, co-expression of p74 and the catalytically defective K296R mutant surprisingly resulted in abnormal morphology and cell death in transformants that maintained a high level of p74 expression. These transformants could be rescued by overexpression of the alpha-subunit of wild-type eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), one of the known substrates for PKR. We hypothesize that competing heterodimers between p74-K296R PKR and eIF2alpha-K296R PKR may control cell growth such that stabilization of the p74-K296R PKR heterodimer induces abnormal morphology and cell death.
dsRNA-binding motifs	dsRBMs	We have identified a 74 kDa double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding protein that shares extensive homology with the mouse spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding (Spnr) protein. p74 contains two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) that are essential for preferential binding to dsRNA. Previously, dsRNA-binding proteins were shown to undergo homo- and heterodimerization, raising the possibility that regulation of activity could be controlled by interactions between different family members. Homodimerization is required to activate the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, whereas hetero-dimerization between PKR and other dsRNA-binding proteins can inhibit kinase activity. We have found that p74 also interacts with PKR, both the wild-type enzyme and a catalytically defective mutant (K296R). While co-expression of p74 and wild-type PKR in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not alter PKR activity, co-expression of p74 and the catalytically defective K296R mutant surprisingly resulted in abnormal morphology and cell death in transformants that maintained a high level of p74 expression.

2'-deoxy-inosine 5'-monophosphate	dIMP	In DNA, the deamination of dAMP generates 2'-deoxy-inosine 5'-monophosphate (dIMP). Hypoxanthine (HX) residues are mutagenic since they give rise to A.T-->G.C transition. They are excised, although with different efficiencies, by an activity of the 3-methyl-adenine (3-meAde)-DNA glycosylases from Escherichia coli (AlkA protein), human cells (ANPG protein), rat cells (APDG protein) and yeast (MAG protein). Comparison of the kinetic constants for the excision of HX residues by the four enzymes shows that the E.coli and yeast enzymes are quite inefficient, whereas for the ANPG and the APDG proteins they repair the HX residues with an efficiency comparable to that of alkylated bases, which are believed to be the primary substrates of these DNA glycosylases. Since the use of various substrates to monitor the activity of HX-DNA glycosylases has generated conflicting results, the efficacy of the four 3-meAde-DNA glycosylases of different origin was compared using three different substrates. Moreover, using oligo-nucleotides containing a single dIMP residue, we investigated a putative sequence specificity of the enzymes involving the bases next to the HX residue. We found up to 2-5-fold difference in the rates of HX excision between the various sequences of the oligonucleotides studied. When the dIMP residue was placed opposite to each of the four bases, a preferential recognition of dI:T over dI:dG, dI:dC and dI:dA mismatches was observed for both human (ANPG) and E.coli (AlkA) proteins. At variance, the yeast MAG protein removed more efficiently HX from a dI:dG over dI:dC, dI:T and dI:dA mismatches.

herpes simplex virus 1	HSV-1	Transcription of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early (IE) genes is determined by multiprotein enhancer complexes. The core enhancer assembly requires the interactions of the POU-homeodomain protein Oct-1, the viral transactivator alphaTIF and the cellular factor C1 (HCF). In this context, the C1 factor interacts with each protein to assemble the stable enhancer complex. In addition, the IE enhancer cores contain adjacent binding sites for other cellular transcription factors such as Sp1 and GA-binding protein (GABP). In this study, a direct interaction of the C1 factor with GABP is demonstrated, defining the C1 factor as the critical coordinator of the enhancer complex assembly. In addition, mutations that reduce the GABP transactivation potential also impair the C1-GABP interaction, indicating that the C1 factor functions as a novel coactivator of GABP-mediated transcription. The interaction and coordinated assembly of the enhancer proteins by the C1 factor may be critical for the regulation of the HSV lytic-latent cycle.

gap junction protein connexin 43	Cx43	Protein-protein interactions are recognized as one of the fundamental mechanisms for relaying the intra- and intercellular signals that are required for normal cellular activities affecting growth, development, and maintenance of homeostasis in tissues and organs. The yeast two-hybrid screen has become a valuable tool for identifying protein-protein interactions. The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) has been implicated in a number of biological processes including development and cellular growth control. To further advance our understanding of the ways in which Cx43 may influence these cellular activities, and to extend our knowledge of the regulation of Cx43 function and/or processing, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid screen technique to identify Cx43-interacting proteins. We present detailed methods for the yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the C terminus of Cx43 as "bait." We also describe additional methods to confirm the interactions between Cx43 and the identified proteins. These methods include in vitro binding assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and subcellular localization using immunofluorescence microscopy. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
adeno-associated virus	AAV	The Rep78 and Rep68 proteins of adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 are involved in DNA replication, regulation of gene expression, and targeting site-specific integration. They bind to a specific Rep recognition sequence (RRS) found in both the viral inverted terminal repeats and the AAVS1 integration locus on human chromosome 19. Previous in vitro studies implied that an N-terminal segment of Rep is involved in DNA recognition, while additional domains might stabilize binding and mediate multimerization. In order to define the minimal requirements for Rep to recognize its target site in the human genome, we developed one-hybrid assays in which DNA-protein interactions are detected in vivo. Chimeric proteins consisting of the N terminus of Rep fused to different oligomerization motifs and a transcriptional activation domain were analyzed for oligomerization, DNA binding, and activation of reporter gene expression. Expression of reporter genes was driven from RRS motifs cloned upstream of minimal promoters and examined in mammalian cells from transfected plasmids and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a reporter cassette integrated into the yeast genome. Our results show for the first time that chimeric proteins containing the amino-terminal 244 residues of Rep are able to target the RRS in vitro and in vivo when incorporated into artificial multimers. These studies suggest that chimeric proteins may be used to harness the unique targeting feature of AAV for gene therapy applications.

sir2p	Sir2	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one determinant of aging or life span is the accumulation of extrachromosomal copies of rDNA circles in old mother cells [1]. The production of rDNA circles depends upon intrachromosomal recombination within the rDNA tandem array, a process regulated by the protein Sir2 (Sir2p). Together with Sir1p, Sir3p, Sir4p and Orc1p, Sir2p is also involved in transcriptional silencing of genes at the silent mating-type cassettes, in the rDNA array, and at telomeres. Using a 'triple silencer' strain that can monitor an increase or decrease in gene expression at these three loci, we found that deletion of the ZDS1 gene caused an increase in silencing in the rDNA and at a silent mating-type cassette at the expense of telomere silencing. The zds1 deletion also resulted in an increase in life span and a decrease in Sir3p phosphorylation. In contrast, deletion of its paralog ZDS2 caused a decrease in rDNA silencing, a decrease in life span and an increase in Sir3p phosphorylation. As Zds2p, but not Zds1p, had strong two-hybrid interactions with Orc1p and the four Sir proteins, Zds1p might indirectly control Sir3p through a Sir3p kinase.
wheat streak mosaic virus	WSMV	The genome organization of the mite-transmitted wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) appears to parallel that of members of the Potyviridae with monopartite genomes, but there are substantial amino acid dissimilarities with other potyviral polyproteins. To initiate studies on the functions of WSMV-encoded proteins, a protein interaction map was generated using a yeast two-hybrid system. Because the pathway of proteolytic maturation of the WSMV polyprotein has not been experimentally determined, random libraries of WSMV cDNA were made both in DNA-binding domain and activation domain plasmid vectors and introduced into yeast. Sequence analysis of multiple interacting pairs revealed that interactions largely occurred between domains within two groups of proteins. The first involved interactions among nuclear inclusion protein a, nuclear inclusion protein b, and coat protein (CP), and the second involved helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and cylindrical inclusion protein (CI). Further immunoblot and deletion mapping analyses of the interactions suggest that subdomains of CI, HC-Pro, and P1 interact with one another. The two-hybrid assay was then performed using full-length genes of CI, HC-Pro, P1, P3, and CP, but no heterologous interactions were detected. In vitro binding assay using glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins and in vitro translation products, however, revealed mutual interactions among CI, HC-Pro, P1, and P3. The failure to detect interactions between full-length proteins by the two-hybrid assay might be due to adverse effects of expression of viral proteins in yeast cells. The capacity to participate in multiple homomeric and heteromeric molecular interactions is consistent with the pleiotropic nature of many potyviral gene mutants and suggests mechanisms for regulation of various viral processes via a network of viral protein complexes.

3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate	PAP	The product of the yeast HAL2 gene (Hal2p) is an in vivo target of sodium and lithium toxicity and its overexpression improves salt tolerance in yeast and plants. Hal2p is a metabolic phosphatase which catalyses the hydrolysis of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP) to AMP. It is, the prototype of an evolutionarily conserved family of PAP phosphatases and the engineering of sodium insensitive enzymes of this group may contribute to the generation of salt-tolerant crops. We have solved the crystal structure of Hal2p in complex with magnesium, lithium and the two products of PAP hydrolysis, AMP and Pi, at 1.6 A resolution. A functional screening of random mutations of the HAL2 gene in growing yeast generated forms of the enzyme with reduced cation sensitivity. Analysis of these mutants defined a salt bridge (Glu238 ellipsis Arg152) and a hydrophobic bond (Va170 ellipsis Trp293) as important framework interactions determining cation sensitivity. Hal2p belongs to a larger superfamily of lithium-sensitive phosphatases which includes inositol monophosphatase. The hydrophobic interaction mutated in Hal2p is conserved in this superfamily and its disruption in human inositol monophosphatase also resulted in reduced cation sensitivity.

pol II	CTD	Recent evidence suggests a role for the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) in pre-mRNA processing. The yeast NRD1 gene encodes an essential RNA-binding protein that shares homology with mammalian CTD-binding proteins and is thought to regulate mRNA abundance by binding to a specific cis-acting element. The present work demonstrates genetic and physical interactions among Nrd1p, the pol II CTD, Nab3p, and the CTD kinase CTDK-I. Previous studies have shown that Nrd1p associates with the CTD of pol II in yeast two-hybrid assays via its CTD-interaction domain (CID). We show that nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles are synthetically lethal with truncation of the CTD to 9 or 10 repeats. Nab3p, a yeast hnRNP, is a high-copy suppressor of some nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles, interacts with Nrd1p in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and coimmunoprecipitates with Nrd1p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of NAB3 are suppressed by deletion of CTK1, a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate the CTD and increase elongation efficiency in vitro. This set of genetic and physical interactions suggests a role for yeast RNA-binding proteins in transcriptional regulation.

pyruvate	PDC	The crystal structure of the complex of the thiamine diphosphate dependent tetrameric enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) from brewer's yeast strain with the activator pyruvamide has been determined to 2.4 A resolution. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two subunits, and the tetrameric molecule is generated by crystallographic symmetry. Structure analysis revealed conformational nonequivalence of the active sites. One of the two active sites in the asymmetric unit was found in an open conformation, with two active site loop regions (residues 104-113 and 290-304) disordered. In the other subunit, these loop regions are well-ordered and shield the active site from the bulk solution. In the closed enzyme subunit, one molecule of pyruvamide is bound in the active site channel, and is located in the vicinity of the thiazolium ring of the cofactor. A second pyruvamide binding site was found at the interface between the Pyr and the R domains of the subunit in the closed conformation, about 10 A away from residue C221. This second pyruvamide molecule might function in stabilizing the unique orientation of the R domain in this subunit which in turn is important for dimer-dimer interactions in the activated tetramer. No difference electron density in the close vicinity of the side chain of residue C221 was found, indicating that this residue does not form a covalent adduct with an activator molecule. Kinetic experiments showed that substrate activation was not affected by oxidation of cysteine residues and therefore does not seem to be dependent on intact thiol groups in the enzyme. The results suggest that a disorder-order transition of two active-site loop regions is a key event in the activation process triggered by the activator pyruvamide and that covalent modification of C221 is not required for this transition to occur. Based on these findings, a possible mechanism for the activation of PDC by its substrate, pyruvate, is proposed.
Src homology domain 3	SH3	Type I myosins are highly conserved actin-based molecular motors that localize to the actin-rich cortex and participate in motility functions such as endocytosis, polarized morphogenesis, and cell migration. The COOH-terminal tail of yeast myosin-I proteins, Myo3p and Myo5p, contains an Src homology domain 3 (SH3) followed by an acidic domain. The myosin-I SH3 domain interacted with both Bee1p and Vrp1p, yeast homologues of human WASP and WIP, adapter proteins that link actin assembly and signaling molecules. The myosin-I acidic domain interacted with Arp2/3 complex subunits, Arc40p and Arc19p, and showed both sequence similarity and genetic redundancy with the COOH-terminal acidic domain of Bee1p (Las17p), which controls Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation. These findings suggest that myosin-I proteins may participate in a diverse set of motility functions through a role in actin assembly.
helicase and RNaseD C-terminal	HRDC	BACKGROUND: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is found at the C terminus of many RecQ helicases, including the human Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins. RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the specific functional roles of these proteins in DNA recombination and replication are not known. An HRDC domain exists in both of the human RecQ homologues that are implicated in human disease and may have an important role in their function. RESULTS: We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the HRDC domain in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RecQ helicase Sgs1p by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. We show that a positively charged region on the surface of the Sgs1p HRDC domain can interact with DNA. Structural similarities to bacterial DNA helicases suggest that the HRDC domain functions as an auxiliary domain in RecQ helicases. Homology models of the Werner and Bloom HRDC domains show different surface properties when compared with Sgs1p. CONCLUSIONS: The HRDC domain represents a structural scaffold that resembles auxiliary domains in proteins that are involved in nucleic acid metabolism. In Sgs1p, the HRDC domain could modulate the helicase function via auxiliary contacts to DNA. However, in the Werner and Bloom syndrome helicases the HRDC domain may have a role in their functional differences by mediating diverse molecular interactions.

infectious bursal disease virus	IBDV	Little is known about the intermolecular interactions between the viral proteins of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). By using the yeast two-hybrid system, which allows the detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo, all possible interactions were tested by fusing the viral proteins to the LexA DNA-binding domain and the B42 transactivation domain. A heterologous interaction between VP1 and VP3, and homologous interactions of pVP2, VP3, VP5 and possibly VP1, were found by co-expression of the fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of the VP1-VP3 complex in IBDV-infected cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Kinetic analyses showed that the complex of VP1 and VP3 is formed in the cytoplasm and eventually is released into the cell-culture medium, indicating that VP1-VP3 complexes are present in mature virions. In IBDV-infected cells, VP1 was present in two forms of 90 and 95 kDa. Whereas VP3 initially interacted with both the 90 and 95 kDa proteins, later it interacted exclusively with the 95 kDa protein both in infected cells and in the culture supernatant. These results suggest that the VP1-VP3 complex is involved in replication and packaging of the IBDV genome.

To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying clathrin-mediated protein transport pathways, we initiated a genetic screen for mutations that display synthetic growth defects when combined with a temperature-sensitive allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene (chc1-521) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations, when present in cells with wild-type clathrin, were analyzed for effects on mating pheromone alpha-factor precursor maturation and sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y as measures of protein sorting at the yeast trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartment. By these criteria, two classes of mutants were obtained, those with and those without defects in protein sorting at the TGN. One mutant with unaltered protein sorting at the TGN contains a mutation in PTC1, a type 2c serine/threonine phosphatase with widespread influences. The collection of mutants displaying TGN sorting defects includes members with mutations in previously identified vacuolar protein sorting genes (VPS), including the dynamin family member VPS1. Striking genetic interactions were observed by combining temperature-sensitive alleles of CHC1 and VPS1, supporting the model that Vps1p is involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle formation at the TGN. Also in the spectrum of mutants with TGN sorting defects are isolates with mutations in the following: RIC1, encoding a product originally proposed to participate in ribosome biogenesis; LUV1, encoding a product potentially involved in vacuole and microtubule organization; and INP53, encoding a synaptojanin-like inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. Disruption of INP53, but not the related INP51 and INP52 genes, resulted in alpha-factor maturation defects and exacerbated alpha-factor maturation defects when combined with chc1-521. Our findings implicate a wide variety of proteins in clathrin-dependent processes and provide evidence for the selective involvement of Inp53p in clathrin-mediated protein sorting at the TGN.

human immunodeficiency virus	HIV	The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to study the dimerization of engineered and naturally occurring variants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease (PR) monomers. Defective monomers that were previously shown to exhibit a dominant-negative (D-N) effect in cultured mammalian cells were tested for their ability to interact in the two-hybrid assay. Similarly, monomers with dimer-interface substitutions and monomers harboring in vivo selected mutations that confer multidrug resistance (mdr) in an AIDS patient were tested for interaction in yeast. Dimer formation between wt monomers with catalytic aspartates was not detected in yeast, whereas the dimerization of PR monomers harboring the acid active site substitution D25N was readily demonstrated. The use of inactive monomers harboring the D25N substitution as a genetic background for studying additional HIV PR mutations allowed for the probing of interactions between monomers with mdr-associated mutations with those based on the HIV-1 HXB2R sequence. The HTLVIII/HIV-1 HXB2R clone has been the basis for a large number of HIV-related plasmids, primers, antibodies, and other specific reagents throughout the HIV research community. The results of our assay suggest that HXB2R-based D-N PR inhibitors associate with variant monomers based on the recently obtained nucleotide sequence from an AIDS patient with a multidrug-resistant virus. These results further encourage the use of D-N PR inhibitors as antiviral agents which may complement existing small-molecule combination therapies. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

heat shock transcription factor	HSF	The heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is the master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response. The identity of a majority of the genes controlled by HSF and the circumstances under which HSF becomes induced are known, but the details of the mechanism by which HSF is able to sense and respond to heat remains an enigma. For example, it is unclear whether HSF senses the heat shock directly or requires ancillary interactions from a heat-induced signaling pathway. We present the analysis of a series of mutations in an alpha-helical bulge in the DNA-binding domain of HSF. Deletion of residues in this bulged region increases the overall activity of the protein. Yeast containing the deletion mutant HSF are able to survive growth temperatures that are lethal to yeast containing wild-type HSF, and they are also constitutively thermotolerant. The increase in activity can be measured as an increase in both constitutive and induced transcriptional activity. The mutant proteins bind DNA more tightly than the wild-type protein does, but this is unlikely to account fully for the increase in transcriptional activity as yeast HSF is constitutively bound to its binding site in vivo. The stability of the mutant proteins to thermal denaturation is lower than wild-type, though their native-state structures are still well-folded. Therefore, the mutants may be structurally analogous to the heat-induced state of HSF, and suggest that the DNA-binding domain of HSF may be capable of sensing heat shock directly.

cleavage factor IA	CF IA	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pre-mRNA 3'-end processing requires six factors: cleavage factor IA (CF IA), cleavage factor IB (CF IB), cleavage factor II (CF II), polyadenylation factor I (PF I), poly(A) polymerase (Pap1p) and poly(A)-binding protein I (Pab1p). We report the characterization of Pfs2p, a WD-repeat protein previously identified in a multiprotein complex carrying PF I-Pap1p activity. The 3'-end-processing defects of pfs2 mutant strains and the results of immunodepletion and immunoinactivation experiments indicate an essential function for Pfs2p in cleavage and polyadenylation. With a one-step affinity purification method that exploits protein A-tagged Pfs2p, we showed that this protein is part of a CF II-PF I complex. Pull-down experiments with GST fusion proteins revealed direct interactions of Pfs2p with subunits of CF II-PF I and CF IA. These results show that Pfs2p plays an essential role in 3'-end formation by bridging different processing factors and thereby promoting the assembly of the processing complex.

glucoamylase G2	GA	The synthesis of a series of 5-thio-D-glucopyranosylarylamines by reaction of 5-thio-D-glucopyranose pentaacetate with the corresponding arylamine and mercuric chloride catalyst is reported. The products were obtained as anomeric mixtures of the tetraacetates which can be separated and crystallized. The tetraacetates were deprotected to give alpha/beta mixtures of the parent compounds which were evaluated as inhibitors of the hydrolysis of maltose by glucoamylase G2 (GA). A transferred NOE NMR experiment with an alpha/beta mixture of 7 in the presence of GA showed that only the alpha isomer is bound by the enzyme. The Ki values, calculated on the basis of specific binding of the alpha isomers, are 0.47 mM for p-methoxy-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (7), 0.78 mM for N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (8), 0.27 mM for p-nitro-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (9) and 0.87 mM for p-trifluoromethyl-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (10), and the K(m) values for the substrates maltose and p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside are 1.2 and 3.7 mM, respectively. Methyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-4-N-(5'-thio-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyrano side (11) is a competitive inhibitor of GA wild-type (Ki 4 microM) and the active site mutant Trp120-->Phe GA (Ki 0.12 mM). Compounds 7, 8, and 11 are also competitive inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase from brewer's yeast, with Ki values of 1.05 mM, > 10 mM, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Molecular modeling of the inhibitors in the catalytic site of GA was used to probe the ligand-enzyme complementary interactions and to offer insight into the differences in inhibitory potencies of the ligands.
adenine nucleotide translocase-1	ANT-1	Here, we describe the isolation of adenine nucleotide translocase-1 (ANT-1) in a screen for dominant, apoptosis-inducing genes. ANT-1 is a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition complex, a protein aggregate connecting the inner with the outer mitochondrial membrane that has recently been implicated in apoptosis. ANT-1 expression led to all features of apoptosis, such as phenotypic alterations, collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA degradation. Both point mutations that impair ANT-1 in its known activity to transport ADP and ATP as well as the NH(2)-terminal half of the protein could still induce apoptosis. Interestingly, ANT-2, a highly homologous protein could not lead to cell death, demonstrating the specificity of the signal for apoptosis induction. In contrast to Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 gene, ANT-1 was unable to elicit a form of cell death in yeast. This and the observed repression of apoptosis by the ANT-1-interacting protein cyclophilin D suggest that the suicidal effect of ANT-1 is mediated by specific protein-protein interactions within the permeability transition pore.
Ras-effector Raf1	Ras	Phage display technology has been used in a variety of contexts to understand and manipulate biomolecular interactions between proteins and other biomolecules. In this paper we describe the establishment of a phage display system for elucidation of the interactions between the GTPase Ras and its panel of effectors. It is shown how technical problems associated with phage display of a protein with unpaired cysteines, likely to be caused by the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm into which the protein is directed, can be overcome by cysteine replacement based on functional and structural studies. First, the catalytic domain (residues 1-166) of mammalian H-Ras (Ras) was observed to be displayed on phage in an incorrect conformation not detectable by antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes on Ras. Although truncation of the phage coat protein used as fusion partner (g3p) resulted in minor improvements in the display, Ras was tailored for phage display by cysteine replacement. By replacing the three cysteines at positions 51, 80 and 118 of Ras with the corresponding residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAS1, the resulting fusion-phage is recognized by the conformation-dependent anti-Ras antibodies. Furthermore, display of cysteine-free Ras is demonstrated by GTP-analogue dependent binding to the Ras-binding domain of the Ras-effector Raf1. These data pave the way for analysis of Ras-effector interactions using phage display technology yet demonstrate that phage display of proteins with normally reduced cysteines should be approached with caution.
Caenorhabditis	Ce	Splicing factor SF1 contributes to the recognition of the 3' splice site by interacting with U2AF65 and binding to the intron branch site during the formation of the early splicing complex E. These interactions and the essential functional domains of SF1 are highly conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have isolated cDNAs encoding SF1 from Drosophila (Dm) and Caenorhabditis (Ce). The encoded proteins share the U2AF65 interaction domain, a hnRNP K homology domain, and one or two zinc knuckles required for RNA binding as well as Pro-rich C-terminal sequences with their yeast and mammalian counterparts. In contrast to SF1 in other species, DmSF1 and CeSF1 are characterized by an N-terminal region enriched in Ser, Arg, Lys, and Asp residues with homology to the RS domains of several splicing proteins. These domains mediate protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, suggesting an additional role for DmSF1 and CeSF1 in pre-mRNA splicing. Human (Hs), fly, and worm SF1 interact equally well with HsU2AF65 or the Drosophila homolog DmU2AF50. Moreover, DmSF1 lacking its N terminus is functional in prespliceosome formation in a HeLa splicing system, emphasizing the conserved nature of interactions at an early step in spliceosome assembly. The Ce-SF1 gene is located in a polycistronic transcription unit downstream of the genes encoding U2AF35 (uaf-2) and a cyclophilin (cyp-13), implying the coordinate transcriptional regulation of these genes. Injection of double-stranded RNA into C. elegans results in embryonic lethality; thus, the SF1 gene is essential not only in yeast but also in at least one metazoan.
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A	elF4A	The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (elF4A) is a representative of the DEAD-box RNA helicase protein family. We have solved the crystallographic structure of the amino-terminal domain (residues 1-223) of yeast elF4A. The domain is built around a core scaffold, a parallel alpha-beta motif with five beta strands, that is found in other RNA and DNA helicases, as well as in the RecA protein. The amino acid sequence motifs that are conserved within the helicase family are localized to the beta strand-->alpha helix junctions within the core. The core of the amino terminal domain of elF4A is amplified with additional structural elements that differ from those of other helicases. The phosphate binding loop (the Walker A motif) is in an unusual closed conformation. The crystallographic structure reveals specific interactions between amino acid residues of the phosphate binding loop, the DEAD motif, and the SAT motif, whose alteration is known to impair coupling between the ATPase cycle and the RNA unwinding activity of elF4A.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Silent Information Regulator	SIR	Previous work has suggested that products of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Silent Information Regulator (SIR) genes form a complex with histones, nucleated by cis-acting silencers or telomeres, which represses transcription in a position-dependent but sequence-independent fashion. While it is generally thought that this Sir complex works through the establishment of heterochromatin, it is unclear how this structure blocks transcription while remaining fully permissive to other genetic processes such as recombination or integration. Here we examine the molecular determinants underlying the silencing of HSP82, a transcriptionally potent, stress-inducible gene. We find that HSP82 is efficiently silenced in a SIR-dependent fashion, but only when HMRE mating-type silencers are configured both 5' and 3' of the gene. Accompanying dominant repression are novel wrapped chromatin structures within both core and upstream promoter regions. Strikingly, DNase I footprints mapping to the binding sites for heat shock factor (HSF) and TATA-binding protein (TBP) are strengthened and broadened, while groove-specific interactions, as detected by dimethyl sulfate, are diminished. Our data are consistent with a model for SIR repression whereby transcriptional activators gain access to their cognate sites but are rendered unproductive by a co-existing heterochromatic complex.

acetyl coenzyme A	AcCoA	We report the crystal structure of the yeast protein Hpa2 in complex with acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) at 2.4 A resolution and without cofactor at 2.9 A resolution. Hpa2 is a member of the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, a family of enzymes with diverse substrates including histones, other proteins, arylalkylamines and aminoglycosides. In vitro, Hpa2 is able to acetylate specific lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 with a preference for Lys14 of histone H3. Hpa2 forms a stable dimer in solution and forms a tetramer upon binding AcCoA. The crystal structure reveals that the Hpa2 tetramer is stabilized by base-pair interactions between the adenine moieties of the bound AcCoA molecules. These base-pairs represent a novel method of stabilizing an oligomeric protein structure. Comparison of the structure of Hpa2 with those of other GNAT superfamily members illustrates a remarkably conserved fold of the catalytic domain of the GNAT family even though members of this family share low levels of sequence homology. This comparison has allowed us to better define the borders of the four sequence motifs that characterize the GNAT family, including a motif that is not discernable in histone acetyltransferases by sequence comparison alone. We discuss implications of the Hpa2 structure for the catalytic mechanism of the GNAT enzymes and the opportunity for multiple histone tail modification created by the tetrameric Hpa2 structure.

guanylyltransferase	CTD	The cotranscriptional placement of the 7-methylguanosine cap on pre-mRNA is mediated by recruitment of capping enzyme to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Immunoblotting suggests that the capping enzyme guanylyltransferase (Ceg1) is stabilized in vivo by its interaction with the CTD and that serine 5, the major site of phosphorylation within the CTD heptamer consensus YSPTSPS, is particularly important. We sought to identify the CTD kinase responsible for capping enzyme targeting. The candidate kinases Kin28-Ccl1, CTDK1, and Srb10-Srb11 can each phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase-CTD fusion protein such that capping enzyme can bind in vitro. However, kin28 mutant alleles cause reduced Ceg1 levels in vivo and exhibit genetic interactions with a mutant ceg1 allele, while srb10 or ctk1 deletions do not. Therefore, only the TFIIH-associated CTD kinase Kin28 appears necessary for proper capping enzyme targeting in vivo. Interestingly, levels of the polyadenylation factor Pta1 are also reduced in kin28 mutants, while several other polyadenylation factors remain stable. Pta1 in yeast extracts binds specifically to the phosphorylated CTD, suggesting that this interaction may mediate coupling of polyadenylation and transcription.
cyclase-associated protein	CAP	Posttranslational modification, in particular farnesylation, of Ras is crucial for activation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase (CYR1). Based on the previous observation that association of CYR1 with cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is essential for its activation by posttranslationally modified Ras, we postulated that the associated CAP might contribute to the formation of a Ras-binding site of CYR1, which mediates CYR1 activation, other than the primary Ras-binding site, the leucine-rich repeat domain. Here, we observed a posttranslational modification-dependent association of Ras with a complex between CAP and CYR1 C-terminal region. When CAP mutants defective in Ras signaling but retaining the CYR1-binding activity were isolated by screening of a pool of randomly mutagenized CAP, CYR1 complexed with two of the obtained three mutants failed to be activated efficiently by modified Ras and exhibited a severely impaired ability to bind Ras, providing a genetic evidence for the importance of the physical association with Ras at the second Ras-binding site. On the other hand, CYR1, complexed with the other CAP mutant, failed to be activated by Ras but exhibited a greatly enhanced binding to Ras. Conversely, a Ras mutant E31K, which exhibits a greatly enhanced binding to the CYR1-CAP complex, failed to activate CYR1 efficiently. Thus, the strength of interaction at the second Ras-binding site appears to be a critical determinant of CYR1 regulation by Ras: too-weak and too-strong interactions are both detrimental to CYR1 activation. These results, taken together with those obtained with mammalian Raf, suggest the importance of the second Ras-binding site in effector regulation.
nifedipine dehydrogenase	NIF	First, the effects of 10 incubation factors were screened altogether on nifedipine dehydrogenase (NIF) and methoxyresorufin O-deethylase (MROD) activities catalyzed by recombinant human CYP3A4 and 1A2, respectively. Using a statistic experimental design, only 36 assays were needed to be exhaustive. Eight factors influenced CYP3A4-mediated NIF activity: buffer type, pH, temperature, Mg/EDTA, cytochrome b5, NADPH-P450 reductase, NADH, and solvent. Two factors had no significant effect: total ionic concentration and catalase/reduced glutathione. Six factors influenced CYP1A2-mediated MROD rates: buffer type, pH, temperature, Mg/EDTA, NADH, and glycerol. Four factors had no significant effect: total ionic concentration, cytochrome b5, reductase, and NAD+. Secondly, the combined effects of ionic strength and Mg concentration on NIF/CYP3A4 were studied and easily modeled using another statistic experimental design. The effect of Mg was strong at a constant ionic strength of 100 mM and negligible at a constant ionic strength of 500 mM. Thirdly, the effects of influencing factors and their interactions on MROD/CYP1A2 were modeled after 40 assays using a third statistic experimental design. Later experiments confirmed the predictivity of the models and the efficiency of optimized conditions. This approach can be applied to other biochemistry areas. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

Secondly, the combined effects of ionic strength and Mg concentration on NIF/CYP3A4 were studied and easily modeled using another statistic experimental design. The effect of Mg was strong at a constant ionic strength of 100 mM and negligible at a constant ionic strength of 500 mM. Thirdly, the effects of influencing factors and their interactions on MROD/CYP1A2 were modeled after 40 assays using a third statistic experimental design. Later experiments confirmed the predictivity of the models and the efficiency of optimized conditions. This approach can be applied to other biochemistry areas. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
RNA polymerase I	Pol I	Transcription termination by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a stepwise process. First the elongating RNA polymerase is forced to pause by DNA-bound transcription termination factor (TTF-I). Then the ternary transcription complex is dissociated by PTRF, a novel factor that promotes release of both nascent transcripts and Pol I from the template. In this study we have investigated the ability of PTRF to liberate transcripts from ternary transcription complexes isolated from yeast and mouse. Using immobilized, tailed templates that contain terminator sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mouse, respectively, we demonstrate that PTRF promotes release of terminated transcripts, irrespective of whether mouse Pol I has interacted with the murine termination factor TTF-I or its yeast homolog Reb1p. In contrast, mouse Pol I paused by the lac repressor remains bound to the template both in the presence and absence of PTRF. We demonstrate that PTRF interacts with the largest subunit of murine Pol I, with TTF-I and Reb1p, but not the lac repressor. The results imply that Pol I transcription termination in yeast and mouse is mediated by conserved interactions between Pol I, Reb1p/TTF-I and PTRF.
residue-rich	BRR	We dissected physical and functional interactions between the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme Ubc2p and Ubr1p, the E3 component of the N-end rule pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The binding of the 20 kDa Ubc2p by the 225 kDa Ubr1p is shown to be mediated largely by the basic residue-rich (BRR) region of Ubr1p. However, mutations of the BRR domain that strongly decrease the interaction between Ubr1p and Ubc2p do not prevent the degradation of N-end rule substrates. In contrast, this degradation is completely dependent on the RING-H2 finger of Ubr1p adjacent to the BRR domain. Specifically, the first cysteine of RING-H2 is required for the ubiquitylation activity of the Ubr1p-Ubc2p complex, although this cysteine plays no detectable role in either the binding of N-end rule substrates by Ubr1p or the physical affinity between Ubr1p and Ubc2p. These results defined the topography of the Ubc2p-Ubr1p interaction and revealed the essential function of the RING-H2 finger, a domain that is present in many otherwise dissimilar E3 proteins of the ubiquitin system.
TATA-binding protein	TBP	Recognition of the TATA box by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a highly regulated step in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Several proteins have been proposed to regulate TBP activity, yet the TBP domains responsive to all these regulators have not been defined. Here we describe a new class of TBP mutants that increase transcription from core promoters in vivo. The majority of these mutations alter amino acids that cluster tightly on the TBP surface, defining a new TBP regulatory domain. The mutant TBP proteins are defective for binding the transcriptional regulator yNC2, are resistant to inhibition by yNC2 in vitro and exhibit allele-specific genetic interactions with yNC2. These results provide strong biochemical and genetic evidence that TBP is directly repressed in vivo, and define a new TBP domain important for transcriptional regulation.
ribonucleoprotein	RNP	Binding of yeast ribosomal protein L5 with 5S rRNA has long been considered a promising model for studying molecular mechanisms of protein-RNA interactions. However, in vitro assembly of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from purified yeast ribosomal protein L5 (also known as L1, L1a, or YL3) and 5S rRNA proved to be difficult, thus limiting the utility of this model. In the present report, we present data on the successful in vitro assembly of a RNP complex using a fusion (MBP-L5) protein consisting of the yeast ribosomal protein L5 fused to the carboxyl terminus of the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). We demonstrated that: 1) the MBP-L5 protein binds yeast 5S rRNA but not 5.8S rRNA in vitro; 2) the MBP protein itself does not bind yeast 5S rRNA; 3) formation of the RNP complex is proportional to the concentration of MBP-L5 protein and 5S rRNA; and 4) the MBP moiety of the fusion protein in the RNP complex can be removed with factor Xa. The electrophoretic mobility of the resultant RNP complex is indistinguishable from that of L5-5S rRNA complex isolated from the ribosome. Using this new experimental approach, we further showed that the RNA binding capability of a mutant L5 protein is decreased by 60% compared to the wild-type protein. Additionally, the mutant RNP complex migrates slower than the wild-type RNP complex suggesting that the mutant RNP complex has a less compact conformation. The finding provides a probable explanation for an earlier observation that the 60S ribosomal subunit containing the mutant protein is unstable.

capsid protein	CP	Repeated, specific interactions between capsid protein (CP) subunits direct virus capsid assembly and exemplify regulated protein-protein interactions. The results presented here reveal a striking in vivo switch in CP assembly. Using cryoelectron microscopy, three-dimensional image reconstruction, and molecular modeling, we show that brome mosaic virus (BMV) CP can assemble in vivo two remarkably distinct capsids that selectively package BMV-derived RNAs in the absence of BMV RNA replication: a 180-subunit capsid indistinguishable from virions produced in natural infections and a previously unobserved BMV capsid type with 120 subunits arranged as 60 CP dimers. Each such dimer contains two CPs in distinct, nonequivalent environments, in contrast to the quasi-equivalent CP environments throughout the 180-subunit capsid. This 120-subunit capsid utilizes most of the CP interactions of the 180-subunit capsid plus nonequivalent CP-CP interactions. Thus, the CP of BMV, and perhaps other viruses, can encode CP-CP interactions that are not apparent from mature virions and may function in assembly or disassembly. Shared structural features suggest that the 120- and 180-subunit capsids share assembly steps and that a common pentamer of CP dimers may be an important assembly intermediate. The ability of a single CP to switch between distinct capsids by means of alternate interactions also implies reduced evolutionary barriers between different capsid structures. The in vivo switch between alternate BMV capsids is controlled by the RNA packaged: a natural BMV genomic RNA was packaged in 180-subunit capsids, whereas an engineered mRNA containing only the BMV CP gene was packaged in 120-subunit capsids. RNA features can thus direct the assembly of a ribonucleoprotein complex between alternate structural pathways.

antineoplastic agent camptothecin	Cpt	DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) relaxes supercoiled DNA by the formation of a covalent intermediate in which the active site tyrosine is transiently bound to the severed DNA strand. The antineoplastic agent camptothecin (Cpt) specifically targets Top1p and several mutations have been isolated that render the enzyme Cpt resistant. The mutated residues, although located in different regions of the enzyme, may constitute part of the Cpt binding site. To begin identifying the structural features of DNA Top1p important for Cpt-induced cytotoxicity, we developed a novel yeast genetic screen to isolate catalytically active, yet Cpt-resistant enzymes from a pool of human top1 mutants. Among the mutations isolated were substitutions of Ser or Val for Gly363, which like the Gly363 to Cys mutation previously reported by us, suppressed the Cpt sensitivity of Top1p. In contrast, each amino-acid substitution differed in its ability to suppress the lethal phenotype and catalytic activity of a human top1 mutant top1T718A that resembles Cpt by stabilizing the covalent intermediate. Biochemical analyses and molecular modeling support a model where interactions between two conserved domains, a central "lip" region containing residue Gly363 and the residues around the active site tyrosine (Tyr723), directly affect the formation of the Cpt-binding site and enzyme catalysis.
yeast TATA-binding protein	TBP	Activation of transcription can occur by the facilitated recruitment of TFIID to promoters by gene-specific activators. To investigate the role of TFIIA in TFIID recruitment in vivo, we exploited a class of yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP) mutants that is activation and DNA binding defective. We found that co-overexpression of TOA1 and TOA2, the genes that encode yeast TFIIA, overcomes the activation defects caused by the TBP mutants. Using a genetic screen, we isolated a new class of TFIIA mutants and identified three regions on TFIIA that are likely to be involved in TBP recruitment or stabilization of the TBP-TATA complex in vivo. Amino acid replacements in only one of these regions enhance TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex formation in vitro, suggesting that the other regions are involved in regulatory interactions. To determine the relative importance of TFIIA in the regulation of different genes, we constructed yeast strains to conditionally deplete TFIIA levels prior to gene activation. While the activation of certain genes, such as INO1, was dramatically impaired by TFIIA depletion, activation of other genes, such as CUP1, was unaffected. These data suggest that TFIIA facilitates DNA binding by TBP in vivo, that TFIIA may be regulated by factors that target distinct regions of the protein, and that promoters vary significantly in the degree to which they require TFIIA for activation.
F-encoded DNA transfer	Tra	Elaboration of conjugative (F) pili by F+ strains of Escherichia coli requires the activities of over a dozen F-encoded DNA transfer (Tra) proteins. The organization and functions of these proteins are largely unknown. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have begun to analyse binary interactions among the Tra proteins required for F-pilus formation. We focus here on interactions involving F-pilin, the only known F-pilus subunit. Using a library of F tra DNA fragments that contained all the F genes required for F pilus formation in a yeast GAL4 activation domain vector (pACTII), we transformed yeast containing a plasmid (pAS1CYH2traA) encoding a GAL4 DNA-binding domain-F-pilin fusion. Doubly transformed cells were screened for GAL4-dependent gene expression. This screen repeatedly identified only a single Tra protein, TraQ, previously identified as a likely F-pilin chaperone. The F-pilin-TraQ interaction appeared to be specific, as no transcriptional activation was detected in yeast transformants containing pACTIItraQ plasmids and the Salmonella typhi pED208 traA gene cloned in pAS1CYH2. Two traQ segments isolated in the screen against F-pilin were tested for complementation of a traQ null allele in E. coli. One, lacking the first 11 (of 94) TraQ amino acids, restored DNA donor activity, donor-specific bacteriophage sensitivity and membrane F-pilin accumulation to wild-type levels. The second, lacking the first 21 amino acids, was much less effective in these assays. Both TraQ polypeptides accumulated in E. coli as transmembrane proteins. The longer, biologically active segment was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain gene of pAS1CYH2 and used to screen the tra fragment library. The only positives from this screen identified traA segments. The fusion sites between the traA and GAL4 segments identified the hydrophobic, C-terminal domain IV of F-pilin as sufficient for the interaction. As TraQ is the only Tra protein required for the accumulation of inner membrane F-pilin, the interaction probably reflects a specific, chaperone-like function for TraQ in E. coli. Attempts to isolate an F-pilin-TraQ complex from E. coli were unsuccessful, suggesting that the interaction between the two is normally transient, as expected from previous studies of the kinetics of TraA membrane insertion and processing to F-pilin.
tetratrico peptide repeat	TPR	We have cloned a novel 100-kDa mammalian protein, which was recognized by an anti-peptide antibody against an epitope-containing nuclear localization signal of NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Predicted amino acid sequence of the protein is similar to those of yeast splicing factors, Prp1p/Zer1p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Prp6p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among these proteins, tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif, which mediates protein-protein interactions, is conserved, whereas leucine zipper motif is found only in the 100-kDa protein. Indirect immunofluorescent staining showed that the 100-kDa protein localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	The SHR3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an integral membrane component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with four membrane-spanning segments and a hydrophilic, cytoplasmically oriented carboxyl-terminal domain. Mutations in SHR3 specifically impede the transport of all 18 members of the amino acid permease (aap) gene family away from the ER. Shr3p does not itself exit the ER. Aaps fully integrate into the ER membrane and fold properly independently of Shr3p. Shr3p physically associates with the general aap Gap1p but not Sec61p, Gal2p, or Pma1p in a complex that can be purified from N-dodecylmaltoside-solubilized membranes. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the Shr3p-Gap1p association is transient, a reflection of the exit of Gap1p from the ER. The ER-derived vesicle COPII coatomer components Sec13p, Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec31p but not Sar1p bind Shr3p via interactions with its carboxyl-terminal domain. The mutant shr3-23p, a nonfunctional membrane-associated protein, is unable to associate with aaps but retains the capacity to bind COPII components. The overexpression of either Shr3p or shr3-23p partially suppresses the temperature-sensitive sec12-1 allele. These results are consistent with a model in which Shr3p acts as a packaging chaperone that initiates ER-derived transport vesicle formation in the proximity of aaps by facilitating the membrane association and assembly of COPII coatomer components.

mitogen-activated protein kinases	MAPKs	The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play critical roles in many signal transduction processes. Several MAPKs have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including Fus3 in the mating pathway and Hog1 in the osmotic-stress response pathway. Cells lacking Fus3 or Hog1 activity are deficient in mating or adaptation to osmotic shock, respectively. However, constitutive activation of either Fus3 or Hog1 is lethal. Therefore, yeast cells have to tightly regulate both the activation and inactivation of Fus3 and Hog1 MAPKs, which are controlled mainly by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that Fus3 activity is negatively regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp3. In contrast, the Hog1 MAPK is mainly dephosphorylated by Ptp2 even though the two phosphatases share a high degree of sequence similarity. To understand the mechanisms of MAPK regulation, we examined the molecular basis underlying the in vivo substrate specificity between phosphatases and MAPKs. We observed that the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of Ptp3 directly interacts with Fus3 via CH2 (Cdc25 homology) domain conserved among yeast PTPases and mammalian MAP kinase phosphatases and is responsible for the in vivo substrate selectivity of the phosphatase. Interaction between Ptp3 and Fus3 is required for dephosphorylation and inactivation of Fus3 under physiological conditions. Mutations in either Ptp3 or Fus3 that abolish this interaction cause a dysregulation of the Fus3 MAPK. Our data demonstrate that the specificity of MAP kinase inactivation in vivo by phosphatases is determined by specific protein-protein interactions outside of the phosphatase catalytic domain.
DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus	EBV	DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) during the productive phase of the life cycle of this herpesvirus depends on the cis-acting element oriLyt. It consists of two essential domains, the upstream and the downstream component. Whereas the upstream component contains several DNA-binding motifs for the viral activator protein BZLF1, the downstream component is known to be the binding site of several cellular proteins. We identified cellular transcription factors that bind synergistically to a functionally relevant subsequence of the downstream component, the TD element. Two of these transcription factors, ZBP-89 and Sp1, stimulate replication as shown by protein fusions with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and a single GAL4 DNA-binding motif inserted into the TD element. In protein binding assays, we observed an interaction of Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its processivity factor. Our data indicate that cellular transcriptional activators tether viral replication proteins to the lytic origin via direct protein-protein interactions to assemble the viral replication complex at oriLyt.
aryl hydrocarbon	Ah	An optimized signal transduction pathway that reproduces the response of human aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor to ligands has been established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ligand treatment induced a 50-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from a reporter plasmid in yeast engineered to express human Ah receptor and Ah nuclear translocator (Arnt) proteins. The archetypal Ah receptor ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin, activated Ah receptor and induced lacZ reporter activity at concentrations of >/=0.3 nM. Mixtures of halogenated and nonhalogenated Ah receptor ligands produced additive signaling responses in this yeast bioassay. These results were consistent with the existence of a common binding site and mechanism of ligand-mediated Ah receptor activation. Although yeast have no natural counterpart to the Ah receptor pathway, expression of human Ah receptor and Arnt under the appropriate conditions provides a functional model system for studying Ah receptor activation and signal transduction.

extracellular matrix	ECM	Candida albicans maintains a commensal relationship with human hosts, probably by adhering to mucosal tissue in a variety of physiological conditions. We show that adherence due to the C. albicans gene ALA1 when transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is comprised of two sequential steps. Initially, C. albicans rapidly attaches to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coated magnetic beads in small numbers (the attachment phase). This is followed by a relatively slower step in which cell-to-cell interactions predominate (the aggregation phase). Neither of these phases is observed in S. cerevisiae. However, expression of the C. albicans ALA1 gene from a low-copy vector causes S. cerevisiae transformants to attach to ECM-coated magnetic beads without appreciable aggregation. Expression of ALA1 from a high-copy vector results in both attachment and aggregation. Moreover, transcriptional fusion of ALA1 with the galactose-inducible promoters GALS, GALL, and GAL1, allowing for low, moderate, and high levels of inducible transcription, respectively, causes attachment and aggregation that correlates with the strength of the GAL promoter. The adherence of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 to a number of protein ligands occurs over a broad pH range, is resistant to shear forces generated by vortexing, and is unaffected by the presence of sugars, high salt levels, free ligands, or detergents. Adherence is, however, inhibited by agents that disrupt hydrogen bonds. The similarities in the adherence and aggregation properties of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 suggest a role in adherence and aggregation for ALA1 and ALA1-like genes in C. albicans.
nucleotide excision repair	NER	The main pathway by which mammalian cells remove DNA damage caused by UV light and some other mutagens is nucleotide excision repair (NER). The best characterised components of the human NER process are those proteins defective in the inherited disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). The proteins known to be involved in the first steps of the NER reaction (damage recognition and incision-excision) are heterotrimeric RPA, XPA, the 6 to 9 subunit TFIIH, XPC-hHR23B, XPG, and ERCC1-XPF. Many interactions between these proteins have been found in recent years using different methods both in mammalian cells and for the homologous proteins in yeast. There are virtually no quantitative measurements of the relative strengths of these interactions. Higher order associations between these proteins in solution and even the existence of a complete "repairosome" complex have been reported, which would have implications both for the mechanism of repair and for the interplay between NER and other cellular processes. Nevertheless, evidence for a completely pre-assembled functional repairosome in solution is inconclusive and the order of action of repair factors on damaged DNA is uncertain.

error-free postreplication repair	PRR	Evidence obtained from recent studies supports the existence of an error-free postreplication repair (PRR) and a mutagenesis pathway within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 DNA repair group. The MMS2 gene is the only known yeast gene involved in error-free PRR that, when mutated, significantly increases the spontaneous mutation rate. In this study, the mutational spectrum of the mms2 mutator was determined and compared to the wild type strain. In addition, mutagenenic effects and genetic interactions of the mms2 mutator and rev3 anti-mutator were examined with respect to forward mutations, frameshift reversions as well as amber and ochre suppressions. It was concluded from these results that the mms2 mutator phenotype is largely dependent on the functional REV3 gene. The synergistic effects of mms2 and rev3 mutations towards killing by a variety of DNA-damaging agents ruled out the possibility that MMS2 simply acts to suppress REV3 activity and favored the hypothesis that MMS2 and REV3 form two alternative subpathways within the RAD6 DNA repair pathway. Taken together, we propose that two pathways represented by MMS2 and REV3 deal with a similar range of endogenous and environmental DNA damage but with different biological consequences, namely, error-free repair and mutagenesis, respectively.
Rho-GTPase activating protein	GAP	The RGD1 gene, identified during sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, encodes a protein with a Rho-GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain at the carboxy-terminal end. The Rgd1 protein showed two-hybrid interactions with the activated forms of Rho2p, Rho3p and Rho4p. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated that Rgd1p stimulated the GTPase activity of both Rho3p and Rho4p; no stimulation was observed on Rho2p. In addition, the rho3Deltargd1Delta double mutant exhibited a dramatic growth defect compared to the single mutants, suggesting that Rgd1p has a GAP activity in vivo. The present study allowed the identification of the first GAP of Rho3p and Rho4p.
upstream activating sequences	UASs	Med8 protein is a regulator that specifically binds to upstream activating sequences (UASs) of SUC2 promoter, to downstream repressing sequences (DRSs) of the HXK2 gene and to the carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II. Atomic force microscopy has allowed for direct visualization of Med8 interactions with a 305 bp fragment of SUC2 promoter and with a 676 bp fragment of HXK2 gene, containing respectively the UASs and DRSs regulatory regions. This approach has provided complementary information about the position and the structure of the DNA-protein complexes. Med8 binding to DNA results in total covering of one of the two existing 7 bp motives (consensus, (A/C)(A/G)GAAAT) in the studied DNA fragments. No preference for binding either of the two UASs of SUC2 promoter as well as for the two DRSs of HXK2 gene has been found. We also discuss whether this protein works as dimer or as a monomer.

TEL2-encoded protein	Tel2p	The telomeres of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae consist of a duplex region of TG(1-3) repeats that acquire a single-stranded 3' extension of the TG(1-3) strand at the end of S-phase. The length of these repeats is kept within a defined range by regulators such as the TEL2-encoded protein (Tel2p). Here we show that Tel2p can specifically bind to single-stranded TG(1-3). Tel2p binding produced several shifted bands; however, only the slowest migrating band contained Tel2p. Methylation protection and interference experiments as well as gel shift experiments using inosine-containing probes indicated that the faster migrating bands resulted from Tel2p-mediated formation of DNA secondary structures held together by G-G interactions. Tel2p bound to single-stranded substrates that were at least 19 bases in length and contained 14 bases of TG(1-3), and also to double-stranded/single-stranded hybrid substrates with a 3' TG(1-3) overhang. Tel2p binding to a hybrid substrate with a 24 base single-stranded TG(1-3) extension also produced a band characteristic of G-G-mediated secondary structures. These data suggest that Tel2p could regulate telomeric length by binding to the 3' single-stranded TG(1-3) extension present at yeast telomeres.

tripartite (protein-RNA-protein) ribonucleoproteins	RNPs	We describe an adaptation of the yeast three-hybrid system that allows the reconstitution in vivo of tripartite (protein-RNA-protein) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). To build and try this system that we called RNP interaction trap assay (RITA), we used as a model the autoantigenic Ro RNPs. hY RNAs bear distinct binding sites for Ro60 and La proteins, and Ro RNPs are thus physiologically tripartite (Ro60/hY RNA/La). Using recombinant La (rLa) and Ro60 (rRo60) proteins and recombinant hY RNAs (rhY) co-expressed in yeast, we found that RNPs made of rRo60/rhY/rLa were readily reassembled. Reconstitution of tripartite RNPs was critically dependent on the presence of an appropriate Ro60 binding site on the recombinant RNA. The RITA assay was further used to detect (rRo60/rhY RNP)-binding proteins from a HeLa cell cDNA library, allowing specific identification of La and of a novel Ro RNP-binding protein (RoBPI) in more than 70% of positive clones. RITA assay may complement already available two- and three-hybrid systems to characterize RNP-binding proteins by allowing the in vivo identification of interactions strictly dependent upon the simultaneous presence of a protein and of its cognate RNA.
protein-RNA-protein) ribonucleoproteins	RITA	We describe an adaptation of the yeast three-hybrid system that allows the reconstitution in vivo of tripartite (protein-RNA-protein) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). To build and try this system that we called RNP interaction trap assay (RITA), we used as a model the autoantigenic Ro RNPs. hY RNAs bear distinct binding sites for Ro60 and La proteins, and Ro RNPs are thus physiologically tripartite (Ro60/hY RNA/La). Using recombinant La (rLa) and Ro60 (rRo60) proteins and recombinant hY RNAs (rhY) co-expressed in yeast, we found that RNPs made of rRo60/rhY/rLa were readily reassembled. Reconstitution of tripartite RNPs was critically dependent on the presence of an appropriate Ro60 binding site on the recombinant RNA.

leech-derived tryptase inhibitor	LDTI	Functional phage display of leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI): construction of a library and selection of thrombin inhibitors.
leech-derived tryptase inhibitor	LDTI	The recombinant phage antibody system pCANTAB 5E has been used to display functionally active leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI) on the tip of the filamentous M13 phage. A limited combinatorial library of 5.2 x 10(4) mutants was created with a synthetic LDTI gene, using a degenerated oligonucleotide and the pCANTAB 5E phagemid. The mutations were restricted to the P1-P4' positions of the reactive site. Fusion phages and appropriate host strains containing the phagemids were selected after binding to thrombin and DNA sequencing. The variants LDTI-2T (K8R, I9V, S10, K11W, P12A), LDTI-5T (K8R, I9V, S10, K11S, P12L) and LDTI-10T (K8R, I9L, S10, K11D, P12I) were produced with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system. The new inhibitors, LDTI-2T and -5T, prolong the blood clotting time, inhibit thrombin (Ki 302 nM and 28 nM) and trypsin (Ki 6.4 nM and 2.1 nM) but not factor Xa, plasma kallikrein or neutrophil elastase. The variant LDTI-10T binds to thrombin but does not inhibit it. The relevant reactive site sequences of the thrombin inhibiting variants showed a strong preference for arginine in position P1 (K8R) and for valine in P1' (I9V). The data indicate further that LDTI-5T might be a model candidate for generation of active-site directed thrombin inhibitors and that LDTI in general may be useful to generate specific inhibitors suitable for a better understanding of enzyme-inhibitor interactions.
alcohol dehydrogenase	ADH	This paper demonstrates a simple graphical approach for the design and analysis of a bioprocess flowsheet in which process interactions are significant. Results are presented showing how the feasible space for operation can be simulated and used both to address key design and operating decisions and to identify suitable trade-offs between operating variables, such as fermentation growth rate and disruption conditions, in order to achieve prespecified levels of process performance. Using verified models to describe the production and isolation of an intracellular protein alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in yeast as a test bed, a series of so-called "windows of operation" are developed at growth rates in the range of 0.06-0.28 h(-1) and for a range of overall process specifications. The effects of altering the process design performance specification as defined by the level of cell debris removal and the overall process productivity on the size and position of the feasible space were investigated to demonstrate the sensitivity of the flowsheet to changes in process objectives. Using the approach it has been possible to visualise the processing trade-offs required to increase performance in terms of the level of cell debris removal by 50% and the overall process productivity by 400% from a defined base level. The approach provides a convenient tool when designing integrated bioprocesses by enabling process options to be compared visually and can help in achieving better process designs and accelerating process development for the biological process industry.

Yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1	YUH1	Yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1 (YUH1), a cysteine protease that catalyzes the removal of ubiquitin C-terminal adducts, is important for the generation of monomeric ubiquitin. Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy has been utilized to map the YUH1 binding surface on ubiquitin. When YUH1 was titrated into a sample of ubiquitin, approximately 50% of the (1)H-(15)N correlation peaks of ubiquitin were affected to some degree, as a result of binding to YUH1. It is noteworthy that the amide resonances of the basic residues (Arg42, Lys48, Arg72, and Lys74) were highly perturbed. These positively charged basic residues may be involved in direct interactions with the negatively charged acidic residues on YUH1. In addition to the electrostatic surface, the hydrophobic surfaces on ubiquitin (Leu8, Ile44, Phe45, Val70, Leu71, and Leu73) and YUH1 are also likely to contribute to the binding interaction. Furthermore, the amide resonances of Ile13, Leu43, Leu50, and Leu69, the side chains of which are not on the surface, were also highly perturbed, indicating substrate-induced changes in the environments of these residues as well. These large changes, observed from residues located throughout the five-stranded beta-sheet surface and the C-terminus, suggest that substrate recognition by YUH1 involves a wider area on ubiquitin.
cytochrome c peroxidase	CCP	The addition of exogenous ligands to the ferric and ferrous states of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) is investigated with magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) at 4 degrees C to determine the effect the protein environment may exercise on spectral properties. The MCD spectrum of each derivative is directly compared to those of analogous forms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and myoglobin (Mb), two well-characterized histidine-ligated heme proteins. The ferric azide adduct of CCP is a hexacoordinate, largely low-spin species with an MCD spectrum very similar to that of ferric azide HRP. This complex displays an MCD spectrum dissimilar from that of the Mb derivative, possibly because of the stabilizing interaction between the azide ligand and the distal arginine of CCP (Arg 48). For the ferric fluoride derivative all three proteins display varied MCD data, indicating that the differences in the distal pocket of each protein influences their respective MCD characteristics. The MCD data for the cyanoferric complexes are similar for all three proteins, demonstrating that a strong field ligand bound in the sixth axial position dominates the MCD characteristics of the derivative. Similarly, the ferric NO complexes of the three proteins show MCD spectra similar in feature position and shape, but vary somewhat in intensity. Reduction of CCP at neutral pH yields a typical pentacoordinate high-spin complex with an MCD spectrum similar to that of deoxyferrous HRP. Formation of the NO and cyanide complexes of ferrous CCP gives derivatives with MCD spectra similar to the analogous forms of HRP and Mb in both feature position and shape. Addition of CO to deoxyferrous CCP results in a ferrous-CO complex with MCD spectral similarity to that of ferrous-CO HRP but not Mb, indicating that interactions between the ligand and the distal residues affects the MCD characteristics. Examination of alkaline (pH 9.7) deoxyferrous CCP indicates that a pH dependent conformational change has occurred, leading to a coordination structure similar to that of ferrous cytochrome b5, a known bis-histidine complex. Exposure of this complex to CO further confirms that a conformational change has taken place in that the MCD spectral characteristics of the resulting complex are similar to those of ferrous-CO Mb but not ferrous-CO HRP.

Fibroblast growth factors	FGF	Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) activate their receptors through the formation of trimolecular complexes, composed of a ligand, a receptor, and a heparan sulfate oligosaccharide, all of which are members of particularly large families capable of multiple interactions in a combinatorial fashion. Understanding this large network of interactions not only presents a great challenge, but is practically beyond the capacity of most classical techniques routinely used to study ligand receptor interactions. We have used the yeast two hybrid system to study protein-protein interactions in the FGF family. Both ligand and receptor ectodomains are properly folded and functional in the yeast. Basic FGF (bFGF) expressed in the yeast dimerizes spontaneously. This self-assembly occurs at low affinity, which can be greatly enhanced by the introduction of heparin, supporting a defined role for heparin in bFGF dimerization. Screening a rat embryo cDNA library with bFGF in the yeast two hybrid system identified a short variant of FGF receptor 1, found most frequently in embryonal and tumor cells and which possesses affinity toward bFGF that is significantly greater than that of the more abundant, full-length receptor. We find the yeast two hybrid system, a most suitable alternative method for the analysis of growth factor-receptor interactions as well as for screening for novel interacting proteins and modulators of FGF and its receptors.

recombinant TAO2 selectively activated mitogen-activated protein/	TAO1	We previously reported the cloning of the thousand and one-amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAO1), a rat homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase sterile 20 protein. Here we report the complete sequence and properties of a related rat protein kinase TAO2. Like TAO1, recombinant TAO2 selectively activated mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) 3, 4, and 6 of the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in vitro and copurified with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. To examine TAO2 interactions with MEKs, the MEK binding domain of TAO2 was localized to an approximately 135-residue sequence just C-terminal to the TAO2 catalytic domain. In vitro this MEK binding domain associated with MEKs 3 and 6 but not MEKs 1, 2, or 4. Using chimeric MEK proteins, we found that the MEK N terminus was sufficient for binding to TAO2. Catalytic activity of full-length TAO2 enhanced its binding to MEKs. However, neither the autophosphorylation of the MEK binding domain of TAO2 nor the activity of MEK itself was required for MEK binding. These results suggest that TAO proteins lie in stress-sensitive kinase cascades and define a mechanism by which these kinases may organize downstream targets.

SCB binding factor	SBF	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two transcription factors, SBF (SCB binding factor) and MBF (MCB binding factor), promote the induction of gene expression at the G(1)/S-phase transition of the mitotic cell cycle. Swi4 and Mbp1 are the DNA binding components of SBF and MBF, respectively. The Swi6 protein is a common subunit of both transcription factors and is presumed to play a regulatory role. SBF binding to its target sequences, the SCBs, is a highly regulated event and requires the association of Swi4 with Swi6 through their C-terminal domains. Swi4 binding to SCBs is restricted to the late M and G(1) phases, when Swi6 is localized to the nucleus. We show that in contrast to Swi6, Swi4 remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle. This finding suggests that the DNA binding domain of Swi4 is inaccessible in the full-length protein when not complexed with Swi6. To explore this hypothesis, we expressed Swi4 and Swi6 in insect cells by using the baculovirus system. We determined that partially purified Swi4 cannot bind SCBs in the absence of Swi6. However, Swi4 derivatives carrying point mutations or alterations in the extreme C terminus were able to bind DNA or activate transcription in the absence of Swi6, and the C terminus of Swi4 inhibited Swi4 derivatives from binding DNA in trans. Full-length Swi4 was determined to be monomeric in solution, suggesting an intramolecular mechanism for auto-inhibition of binding to DNA by Swi4. We detected a direct in vitro interaction between a C-terminal fragment of Swi4 and the N-terminal 197 amino acids of Swi4, which contain the DNA binding domain. Together, our data suggest that intramolecular interactions involving the C-terminal region of Swi4 physically prevent the DNA binding domain from binding SCBs. The interaction of the carboxy-terminal region of Swi4 with Swi6 alleviates this inhibition, allowing Swi4 to bind DNA.

yeast nuclear cap-binding complex	yCBC	Yeast strains lacking the yeast nuclear cap-binding complex (yCBC) are viable, although impaired in growth. We have taken advantage of this observation to carry out a genetic screen for components that show synthetic lethality (SL) with a cbp20-Delta cbp80-Delta double mutation. One set of SL interactions was due to mutations that were complemented by components of U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) and the yeast splicing commitment complex. These interactions confirm the role of yCBC in commitment complex formation. Physical interaction of yCBC with the commitment complex components Mud10p and Mud2p, which may directly mediate yCBC function, was demonstrated. Unexpectedly, we identified multiple SL mutations that were complemented by Cbf5p and Nop58p. These are components of the two major classes of yeast small nucleolar RNPs, which function in the maturation of rRNA precursors. Mutants lacking yCBC were found to be defective in rRNA processing. Analysis of the yCBC deletion phenotype suggests that this is likely to be due to a defect in the splicing of a subset of ribosomal protein mRNA precursors.

tRNAMet(i)	tRNA	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene RIT1 encodes a phospho-ribosyl transferase that exclusively modifies the initiator tRNA (tRNAMet(i)) by the addition of a 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate group to Adenosine 64. As a result, tRNAMet(i) is prevented from participating in the elongation steps of protein synthesis. We previously showed that the modification is not essential for the function of tRNAMet(i) in the initiation of translation, since rit1 null strains are viable and show no obvious growth defects. Here, we demonstrate that yeast strains in which a rit1 null allele is combined with mutations in any of the genes for the three subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2), or with disruption alleles of two of the four initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) genes, show synergistic growth defects. A multicopy plasmid carrying an IMT gene can alleviate these defects. On the other hand, introduction of a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the TEF2 gene, which encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 1alpha (eEF-1alpha), into rit1 null strains with two intact IMT genes had the opposite effect, indicating that increased levels of eEF-1alpha are deleterious to these strains, presumably due to sequestration of the unmodified met-tRNAMet(i) for elongation. Thus, under conditions in which the components of the ternary met-tRNAMet(i):GTP:eIF-2 complex become limiting or are functionally impaired, the presence of the 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate modification in tRNAMet(i) is important for the provision of adequate amounts of tRNAMet(i) for formation of this ternary complex.

A multicopy plasmid carrying an IMT gene can alleviate these defects. On the other hand, introduction of a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the TEF2 gene, which encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 1alpha (eEF-1alpha), into rit1 null strains with two intact IMT genes had the opposite effect, indicating that increased levels of eEF-1alpha are deleterious to these strains, presumably due to sequestration of the unmodified met-tRNAMet(i) for elongation. Thus, under conditions in which the components of the ternary met-tRNAMet(i):GTP:eIF-2 complex become limiting or are functionally impaired, the presence of the 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate modification in tRNAMet(i) is important for the provision of adequate amounts of tRNAMet(i) for formation of this ternary complex.
initiator methionine tRNA	IMT	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene RIT1 encodes a phospho-ribosyl transferase that exclusively modifies the initiator tRNA (tRNAMet(i)) by the addition of a 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate group to Adenosine 64. As a result, tRNAMet(i) is prevented from participating in the elongation steps of protein synthesis.

Drosophila Reaper	RPR	Drosophila Reaper (RPR), Head Involution Defective (HID), and GRIM induce caspase-dependent cell death and physically interact with the cell death inhibitor DIAP1. Here we show that HID blocks DIAP1's ability to inhibit caspase activity and provide evidence suggesting that RPR and GRIM can act similarly. Based on these results, we propose that RPR, HID, and GRIM promote apoptosis by disrupting productive IAP-caspase interactions and that DIAP1 is required to block apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that elimination of DIAP1 function results in global early embryonic cell death and a large increase in DIAP1-inhibitable caspase activity and that DIAP1 is still required for cell survival when expression of rpr, hid, and grim is eliminated.

glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1	GRIP-1	A mutation in the nuclear orphan receptor RORalpha results in a severe impairment of cerebellar development by unknown mechanisms. We have shown previously that RORalpha contains a strong constitutive activation domain in its C terminus. We therefore searched for mammalian RORalpha coactivators using the minimal activation domain as bait in a two-hybrid screen. Several known and putative coactivators were isolated, including glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein (PBP/TRAP220/DRIP205). These interactions were confirmed in vitro and require the intact activation domain of RORalpha although different requirements for interaction with GRIP-1 and PBP were detected. Even in the absence of exogenous ligand, RORalpha interacts with a complex or complexes of endogenous proteins, similar to those that bind to ligand-occupied thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors. Both PBP and GRIP-1 were shown to be present in these complexes. Thus we have identified several potential RORalpha coactivators that, in contrast to the interactions with hormone receptors, interact with RORalpha in yeast, in bacterial extracts, and in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro in the absence of exogenous ligand. GRIP-1 functioned as a coactivator for the RORalpha both in yeast and in mammalian cells. Thus, GRIP-1 is the first proven coactivator for RORalpha.

yeast cytoskeletal assembly protein	Sla1	Striking similarities between cytoskeletal assembly and the "nucleated polymerization" model of prion propagation suggest that similar or overlapping sets of proteins may assist in both processes. We show that the C-terminal domain of the yeast cytoskeletal assembly protein Sla1 (Sla1C) specifically interacts with the N-terminal prion-forming domain (Sup35N) of the yeast release factor Sup35 (eRF3) in the two-hybrid system. Sla1C and several other Sup35N-interacting proteins also exhibit two-hybrid interactions with the poly-Gln-expanded N-proximal fragment of human huntingtin, which promotes Huntington disease-associated aggregation. The Sup35N-Sla1C interaction is inhibited by Sup35N alterations that make Sup35 unable to propagate the [PSI(+)] state and by the absence of the chaperone protein Hsp104, which is essential for [PSI] propagation. In a Sla1(-) background, [PSI] curing by dimethylsulfoxide or excess Hsp104 is increased, while translational readthrough and de novo [PSI] formation induced by excess Sup35 or Sup35N are decreased. These data show that, in agreement with the proposed function of Sla1 during cytoskeletal formation, Sla1 assists in [PSI] formation and propagation, but is not required for these processes. Sla1(-) strains are sensitive to some translational inhibitors, and some sup35 mutants, obtained in a Sla1(-) background, are sensitive to Sla1, suggesting that the interaction between Sla1 and Sup35 proteins may play a role in the normal function of the translational apparatus. We hypothesize that Sup35N is involved in regulatory interactions with intracellular structural networks, and [PSI] prion may be formed as a by-product of this process.
gross chromosomal rearrangements	GCRs	Cancer progression is often associated with the accumulation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), such as translocations, deletion of a chromosome arm, interstitial deletions or inversions. In many instances, GCRs inactivate tumour-suppressor genes or generate novel fusion proteins that initiate carcinogenesis. The mechanism underlying GCR formation appears to involve interactions between DNA sequences of little or no homology. We previously demonstrated that mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-stranded DNA binding protein (RFA1) increase microhomology-mediated GCR formation. To further our understanding of GCR formation, we have developed a novel mutator assay in S. cerevisiae that allows specific detection of such events. In this assay, the rate of GCR formation was increased 600-5, 000-fold by mutations in RFA1, RAD27, MRE11, XRS2 and RAD50, but was minimally affected by mutations in RAD51, RAD54, RAD57, YKU70, YKU80, LIG4 and POL30. Genetic analysis of these mutants suggested that at least three distinct pathways can suppress GCRs: two that suppress microhomology-mediated GCRs (RFA1 and RAD27) and one that suppresses non-homology-mediated GCRs (RAD50/MRE11/XRS2).
Trithorax	TRX	Trithorax (TRX) and ASH1 belong to the trithorax group (trxG) of transcriptional activator proteins, which maintains homeotic gene expression during Drosophila development. TRX and ASH1 are localized on chromosomes and share several homologous domains with other chromatin-associated proteins, including a highly conserved SET domain and PHD fingers. Based on genetic interactions between trx and ash1 and our previous observation that association of the TRX protein with polytene chromosomes is ash1 dependent, we investigated the possibility of a physical linkage between the two proteins. We found that the endogenous TRX and ASH1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate from embryonic extracts and colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRX and ASH1 bind in vivo to a relatively small (4 kb) bxd subregion of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), which contains several trx response elements. Analysis of the effects of ash1 mutations on the activity of this regulatory region indicates that it also contains ash1 response element(s). This suggests that ASH1 and TRX act on Ubx in relatively close proximity to each other. Finally, TRX and ASH1 appear to interact directly through their conserved SET domains, based on binding assays in vitro and in yeast and on coimmunoprecipitation assays with embryo extracts. Collectively, these results suggest that TRX and ASH1 are components that interact either within trxG protein complexes or between complexes that act in close proximity on regulatory DNA to maintain Ubx transcription.

heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein	G protein	Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gpa2p, the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), is involved in the regulation of vegetative growth and pseudohyphal development. Here we report that Gpa2p also controls sporulation by interacting with the regulatory domain of Ime2p (Sme1p), a protein kinase essential for entrance of meiosis and sporulation. Protein-protein interactions between Gpa2p and Ime2p depend on the GTP-bound state of Gpa2p and correlate with down-regulation of Ime2p kinase activity in vitro. Overexpression of Ime2p inhibits pseudohyphal development and enables diploid cells to sporulate even in the presence of glucose or nitrogen. In contrast, overexpression of Gpa2p in cells simultaneously overproducing Ime2p results in a drastic reduction of sporulation efficiency, demonstrating an inhibitory effect of Gpa2p on Ime2p function. Furthermore, deletion of GPA2 accelerates sporulation on low-nitrogen medium. These observations are consistent with the following model. In glucose-containing medium, diploid cells do not sporulate because Ime2p is inactive or expressed at low levels. Upon starvation, expression of Gpa2p and Ime2p is induced but sporulation is prevented as long as nitrogen is present in the medium. The negative control of Ime2p kinase activity is exerted at least in part through the activated form of Gpa2p and is released as soon as nutrients are exhausted. This model attributes a switch function to Gpa2p in the meiosis-pseudohyphal growth decision.
guanosine monophosphate	8-bromo-cGMP	Saccharomyces cerevisiae was inoculated into a dilute synthetic minimal medium with glycerol as the carbon source. The number of live cells in the cultures was determined by colony counts on agar plates. Untreated control cells had doubled in number about once at the end of the first week and had gone through eight doublings by the end of the second week. Addition of either 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP) or human recombinant insulin, made the cells go through 12 and 10 doublings, respectively, by the end of the first week. In contrast, 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP) had only slight stimulating effects on cell multiplication, but if it was combined with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) the cells went through about 12 doublings during the first week. Addition of LY 83583, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, prevented cell proliferation. Further addition of 8-bromo-cGMP bypassed this inhibition. Singly, bradykinin or PMA did not affect cell multiplication. However, when these two compounds were combined, the cells went through about 10 doublings during the first week. Neither bradykinin, nor PMA had any releasing effect on the inhibition of LY 83583. These results indicate the existence of several routes leading to cell proliferation in wildtype S. cerevisiae cells. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

carbamoyl phosphate synthetase	CPSase	The first two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are catalyzed by a 240-kDa bifunctional protein encoded by the ura2 locus. Although the constituent enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) function independently, there are interdomain interactions uniquely associated with the multifunctional protein. Both CPSase and ATCase are feedback inhibited by UTP. Moreover, the intermediate carbamoyl phosphate is channeled from the CPSase domain where it is synthesized to the ATCase domain where it is used in the synthesis of carbamoyl aspartate. To better understand these processes, a recombinant plasmid was constructed that encoded a protein lacking the amidotransferase domain and the amino half of the CPSase domain, a 100-kDa chain segment. The truncated complex consisted of the carboxyl half of the CPSase domain fused to the ATCase domain via the pDHO domain, an inactive dihydroorotase homologue that bridges the two functional domains in the native molecule. Not only was the "half CPSase" catalytically active, but it was regulated by UTP to the same extent as the parent molecule. In contrast, the ATCase domain was no longer sensitive to the nucleotide, suggesting that the two catalytic activities are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Most remarkably, isotope dilution and transient time measurements showed that the truncated complex channels carbamoyl phosphate. The overall CPSase-ATCase reaction is much less sensitive than the parent molecule to the ATCase bisubstrate analogue, N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), providing evidence that the endogenously produced carbamoyl phosphate is sequestered and channeled to the ATCase active site.

quantitative structure-activity relationships	QSARs	Molecular modelling of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae via homology with CYP102, a unique bacterial cytochrome P450 isoform: quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) within two related series of antifungal azole derivatives.
quantitative structure-activity relationship	QSAR	The construction of a three-dimensional molecular model of the fungal form of cytochrome P450 (CYP51) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on homology with the haemoprotein domain of CYP102 from Bacillus megaterium (a unique bacterial P450 of known crystal structure) is described. It is found that the endogenous substrate, lanosterol, can readily occupy the putative active site of the CYP51 model such that the known mono-oxygenation reaction, leading to C14-demethylation of lanosterol, is the preferred route of metabolism for this particular substrate. Key amino acid contacts within the CYP51 active site appear to orientate lanosterol for oxidative attack at the C14-methyl group, and the position of the substrate relative to the haem moiety is consistent with the phenyl-iron complexation studies reported by Tuck et al. [J. Biol. Chem., 267, 13175-13179 (1992)]. Typical azole inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, are able to fit the putative active site of CYP51 by a combination of haem ligation, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions within the enzyme's haem environment. The mode of action of azole antifungals, as described by the modelling studies, is supported by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses on two groups of structurally related fungal inhibitors. Moreover, the results of molecular electrostatic isopotential (EIP) energy calculations are compatible with the proposed mode of binding between azole antifungal agents and the putative active site of CYP51, although membrane interactions may also have a role in the antifungal activity of azole derivatives.

splice site	5'SS	A U5 snRNP protein, hPrp8, interacts closely with the GU dinucleotide at the 5' splice site (5'SS), forming a specific UV-inducible cross-link. To test if this physical contact between the 5'SS and the carboxy-terminal region of Prp8 reflects a functional recognition of the 5'SS during spliceosome assembly, we mutagenized the corresponding region of yeast Prp8 and screened the resulting mutants for suppression of 5'SS mutations in vivo. All of the isolated prp8 alleles not only suppress 5'SS but also 3'SS mutations, affecting the second catalytic step. Suppression of the 5'SS mutations by prp8 alleles was also tested in the presence of U1-7U snRNA, a predicted suppressor of the U+2A mutation. As expected, U1-7U efficiently suppresses prespliceosome formation, and the first, but not the second, step of U+2A pre-mRNA splicing. Independently, Prp8 functionally interacts with both splice sites at the later stage of splicing, affecting the efficiency of the second catalytic step. The striking proximity of two of the prp8 suppressor mutations to the site of the 5'SS:hPrp8 cross-link suggests that some protein:5'SS contacts made before the first step may be subsequently extended to accommodate the 3'SS for the second catalytic step. Together, these results strongly implicate Prp8 in specific interactions at the catalytic center of the spliceosome.

Enhancer of split	E(spl)	Enhancer of split [E(spl)] refers to a gene complex in Drosophila melanogaster, which contains a number of target genes of the Notch signaling pathway. The complex was originally identified by a dominant mutation E(spl)(D) that displays allele-specific interactions with a recessive mutation in the Notch locus called split (N(spl)). The spl phenotype is characterized by smaller eyes with irregularly spaced ommatidia, and it is strongly enhanced by E(spl)(D). This enhancement is correlated with a truncation of one of the E(spl) bHLH genes, m8, causing an increased stability of the mutant transcripts and an altered C-terminus in the mutant M8* protein. Concurrently, an insertion of a middle repetitive element in the adjacent groucho (gro) gene was observed. In this work, three different E(spl)(D) revertants (BE22, BE25, BX37), which have lost the ability to enhance N(spl) completely, were analyzed at the molecular level. In each case, the structure of the mutant M8* protein was affected, suggesting a specific involvement of the aberrant protein in the enhancement of the spl phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a perfect phenocopy of spl enhancement can be achieved with hybrid constructs, where the altered C-terminus of M8* was fused to other E(spl) bHLH proteins. Thus, the ability to interact with N(spl) is not restricted to M8* but instead can be induced by an appropriate mutation in other E(spl) bHLH genes within the context of N(spl). In a N(spl) background, E(spl)(D) behaves like a hyperactive M8 mutation. However, the mutant M8* protein has lost the ability of binding to the corepressor Gro, which is an essential feature for normal E(spl) activity. Yet, other protein interactions, notably those with other bHLH proteins of either E(spl) or proneural family, are still observed. These findings suggest that the structural changes associated with the E(spl)(D) mutant protein are the primary cause for the phenotypic interactions with the recessive Notch mutation N(spl).

This enhancement is correlated with a truncation of one of the E(spl) bHLH genes, m8, causing an increased stability of the mutant transcripts and an altered C-terminus in the mutant M8* protein. Concurrently, an insertion of a middle repetitive element in the adjacent groucho (gro) gene was observed. In this work, three different E(spl)(D) revertants (BE22, BE25, BX37), which have lost the ability to enhance N(spl) completely, were analyzed at the molecular level. In each case, the structure of the mutant M8* protein was affected, suggesting a specific involvement of the aberrant protein in the enhancement of the spl phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a perfect phenocopy of spl enhancement can be achieved with hybrid constructs, where the altered C-terminus of M8* was fused to other E(spl) bHLH proteins. Thus, the ability to interact with N(spl) is not restricted to M8* but instead can be induced by an appropriate mutation in other E(spl) bHLH genes within the context of N(spl). In a N(spl) background, E(spl)(D) behaves like a hyperactive M8 mutation. However, the mutant M8* protein has lost the ability of binding to the corepressor Gro, which is an essential feature for normal E(spl) activity. Yet, other protein interactions, notably those with other bHLH proteins of either E(spl) or proneural family, are still observed. These findings suggest that the structural changes associated with the E(spl)(D) mutant protein are the primary cause for the phenotypic interactions with the recessive Notch mutation N(spl).

groucho	gro	Enhancer of split [E(spl)] refers to a gene complex in Drosophila melanogaster, which contains a number of target genes of the Notch signaling pathway.

rotational echo double resonance	REDOR	The utility of rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR spectroscopy for determining the conformations of linear peptides has been examined critically using a series of crystalline and amorphous samples. The focus of the present work was the evaluation of long-distance (> 5 A) interactions using 13C-15N dephasing. Detailed studies of specifically labeled melanostatin and synthetic analogs of the alpha-factor yeast mating hormone show that nitrogen-dephased, carbon-observe REDOR measurements are reliable for distances up to 6.0 A, and that dipolar interactions can be detected for distances up to 7 A. By contrast, nitrogen-observe REDOR gives reliable results only for distances shorter than 5.0 A. To measure distances accurately, REDOR data must be corrected for the effects of natural-abundance spins. These corrections are particularly important for measuring long distances, which are of the greatest value for determining peptide secondary structure. We have developed a spherical shell model for calculating the effect of these background spins. The REDOR studies also indicate that in a lyophilized powder, the tridecapeptide alpha-factor mating pheromone from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (WHWLQLKPGQPMY) probably exists as a distribution of different turn structures around the KPGQ region. This finding revises previous solid-state NMR studies on this peptide, which concluded alpha-factor assumes a distorted type-I beta-turn in the Pro-Gly central region of the molecule [J.R. Garbow, M. Breslav, O. Antohi, F. Naider, Biochemistry, 33 (1994) 10094].
guanine nucleotide exchange factors	GEFs	Two families of GTPases, Arfs and Ypt/rabs, are key regulators of vesicular transport. While Arf proteins are implicated in vesicle budding from the donor compartment, Ypt/rab proteins are involved in the targeting of vesicles to the acceptor compartment. Recently, we have shown a role for Ypt31/32p in exit from the yeast trans-Golgi, suggesting a possible function for Ypt/rab proteins in vesicle budding as well. Here we report the identification of a new member of the Sec7-domain family, SYT1, as a high-copy suppressor of a ypt31/32 mutation. Several proteins that belong to the Sec7-domain family, including the yeast Gea1p, have recently been shown to stimulate nucleotide exchange by Arf GTPases. Nucleotide exchange by Arf GTPases, the switch from the GDP- to the GTP-bound form, is thought to be crucial for their function. Sec7p itself has an important role in the yeast secretory pathway. However, its mechanism of action is not yet understood. We show that all members of the Sec7-domain family exhibit distinct genetic interactions with the YPT genes. Biochemical assays demonstrate that, although the homology between the members of the Sec7-domain family is relatively low (20-35%) and limited to a small domain, they all can act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Arf proteins, but not for Ypt GTPases. The Sec7-domain of Sec7p is sufficient for this activity. Interestingly, the Sec7 domain activity is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that inhibits some of the Arf-GEFs, indicating that this domain is a target for BFA. These results demonstrate that the ability to act as Arf-GEFs is a general property of all Sec7-domain proteins in yeast. The genetic interactions observed between Arf GEFs and Ypt GTPases suggest the existence of a Ypt-Arf GTPase cascade in the secretory pathway.

helix H3	UCH-L3	The interaction between the 26 kDa yeast ubiquitin hydrolase (YUH1), involved in maintaining the monomeric ubiquitin pool in cells, and the 8.5 kDa yeast ubiquitin protein has been studied by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shift perturbation of backbone (1)H(N), (15)N, and (13)C(alpha) resonances of YUH1, in a YUH1-ubiquitin mixture and in a 35 kDa covalent complex with ubiquitin (a stable analogue of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate), was employed to identify the ubiquitin binding interface of YUH1. This interface mapped on the secondary structure of YUH1 suggests a wide area of contact for ubiquitin, encompassing the N-terminus, alpha1, alpha4, beta2, beta3, and beta6, coincident with the high specificity of YUH1 for ubiquitin. The presence of several hydrophobic clusters in the ubiquitin binding interface of YUH1 suggests that hydrophobic interactions are equally important as ionic interactions in contacting ubiquitin. The residues in the binding interface exhibit a high percentage of homology among the members of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family, indicating the well-conserved nature of the ubiquitin binding interface reported in this study. The secondary structure of YUH1, from our NMR studies, was similar to the recently determined structure of its human homologue ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCH-L3), except for the absence of the helix H3 of UCH-L3. This region in YUH1 (helix H3 of UCH-L3) was least perturbed upon ubiquitin binding. Therefore, the binding interface was mapped onto the corresponding residues in the UCH-L3 crystal structure. A model for ubiquitin binding to YUH1 is proposed, in which a good correlation was observed for the lateral binding of ubiquitin to UCH-L3 (YUH1), stabilized by the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.
temperature-sensitive	ts	hsHec1p, a Homo sapiens coiled-coil-enriched protein, plays an important role in M-phase progression in mammalian cells. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, identical to Tid3p/Ndc80p and here designated scHec1p, has similarities in structure and biological function to hsHec1p. Budding yeast cells deleted in the scHEC1/NDC80 allele are not viable, but this lethal phenotype can be rescued by hsHEC1 under control of the endogenous scHEC1 promoter. At the nonpermissive temperature, significant mitotic delay, chromosomal missegregation, and decreased viability were observed in yeast cells with temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles of hsHEC1. In the hshec1-113 ts mutant, we found a single-point mutation changing Trp395 to a stop codon, which resulted in the expression of a C-terminally truncated 45-kDa protein. The binding of this mutated protein, hshec1-113p, to five identified hsHec1p-associated proteins was unchanged, while its binding to human SMC1 protein and yeast Smc1p was ts. Hec1p also interacts with Smc2p, and the binding of the mutated hshec1-113p to Smc2p was not ts. Overexpression of either hsHEC1 or scHEC1 suppressed the lethal phenotype of smc1-2 and smc2-6 at nonpermissive temperatures, suggesting that the interactions between Hec1p and Smc1p and -2p are biologically significant. These results suggest that Hec1 proteins play a critical role in modulating chromosomal segregation, in part, through their interactions with SMC proteins.
eukaryotic initiation factor 4F	eIF4F	Eukaryotic translation initiation involves recognition of the 5' end of cellular mRNA by the cap-binding complex known as eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). Initiation is a key point of regulation in gene expression in response to mechanisms mediated by signal transduction pathways. We have investigated the molecular interactions underlying inhibition of human eIF4E function by regulatable repressors called 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Two essential components of eIF4F are the cap-binding protein eIF4E, and eIF4G, a multi-functional protein that binds both eIF4E and other essential eIFs. We show that the 4E-BPs 1 and 2 block the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E by competing for binding to a dorsal site on eIF4E. Remarkably, binding of the 4E-BPs at this dorsal site enhances cap-binding via the ventral cap-binding slot, thus trapping eIF4E in inactive complexes with high affinity for capped mRNA. The binding contacts and affinities for the interactions between 4E-BP1/2 and eIF4E are distinct (estimated K(d) values of 10(-8) and 3x10(-9) for 4E-BP1 and 2, respectively), and the differences in these properties are determined by three amino acids within an otherwise conserved motif. These data provide a quantitative framework for a new molecular model of translational regulation.

HIV type 1	HIV-1	Transcriptional activation of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element by the viral Tat protein is an essential step in the HIV-1 life cycle. Tat function is mediated by the TAR RNA target element encoded within the LTR and is known to require the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and the cyclin T1 (CycT1) component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to TAR. Here, we demonstrate that both TAR and Tat become entirely dispensable for activation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter when CycT1/P-TEFb is artificially recruited to a heterologous promoter proximal RNA target. The level of activation observed was indistinguishable from the level induced by Tat and was neither inhibited nor increased when Tat was expressed in trans. Activation by artificially recruited CycT1 depended on the ability to bind the CDK9 component of P-TEFb. In contrast, although binding to both Tat and TAR was essential for the ability of CycT1 to act as a Tat cofactor, these interactions became dispensable when CycT1 was directly recruited to the LTR. Importantly, activation of the LTR both by Tat and by directly recruited CycT1 was found to be at the level of transcription elongation. Together, these data demonstrate that recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR is fully sufficient to activate this promoter element and imply that the sole role of the Tat/TAR axis in viral transcription is to permit the recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb.

preSu9(1-112)-dihydrofolate reductas	DHFR	Export of N-terminal tails of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins from the mitochondrial matrix is a membrane potential-dependent process, mediated by the Oxa1p translocation machinery. The hydrophilic segments of these membrane proteins, which undergo export, display a characteristic charge profile where intermembrane space-localized segments bear a net negative charge, whereas those remaining in the matrix have a net positive one. Using a model protein, preSu9(1-112)-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which undergoes Oxa1p-mediated N-tail export, we demonstrate here that the net charge of N- and C-flanking regions of the transmembrane domain play a critical role in determining the orientation of the insertion process. The N-tail must bear a net negative charge to be exported to the intermembrane space. Furthermore, a net positive charge of the C-terminal region supports this N-tail export event. These data provide experimental evidence that protein export in mitochondria adheres to the "positive-inside" rule, described for sec-independent sorting of membrane proteins in prokaryotes. We propose here that the importance of a charge profile reflects a need for specific protein-protein interactions to occur in the export reaction, presumably at the level of the Oxa1p export machinery.
prion-determining domain	PrD	The yeast non-Mendelian factor [URE3] propagates by a prion-like mechanism, involving aggregation of the chromosomally encoded protein Ure2. The [URE3] phenotype is equivalent to loss of function of Ure2, a protein involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism. The prion-like behaviour of Ure2 in vivo is dependent on the first 65 amino acid residues of its N-terminal region which contains a highly repetitive sequence rich in asparagine. This region has been termed the prion-determining domain (PrD). Removal of as little as residues 2-20 of the protein is sufficient to prevent occurrence of the [URE3] phenotype. Removal of the PrD does not affect the regulatory activity of Ure2. The C-terminal portion of the protein has homology to glutathione S -transferases, which are dimeric proteins. We have produced the Ure2 protein to high yield in Escherichia coli from a synthetic gene. The recombinant purified protein is shown to be a dimer. The stability, folding and oligomeric state of Ure2 and a series of N-terminally truncated or deleted variants were studied and compared. The stability of Ure2, DeltaGD-N, H2O, determined by chemical denaturation and monitored by fluorescence, is 12.1(+/-0.4) kcal mol-1at 25 degrees C and pH 8.4. A range of structural probes show a single, coincident unfolding transition, which is invariant over a 550-fold change in protein concentration. The stability is the same within error for Ure2 variants lacking all or part of the prion-determining domain. The data indicate that in the folded protein the PrD is in an unstructured conformation and does not form specific intra- or intermolecular interactions at micromolar protein concentrations. This suggests that the C-terminal domain may stabilise the PrD against prion formation by steric means, and implies that the PrD does not induce prion formation by altering the thermodynamic stability of the folded protein.

yeast 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase	ALAD	The X-ray structure of the complex formed between yeast 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and the inhibitor laevulinic acid has been determined at 2.15 A resolution. The inhibitor binds by forming a Schiff base link with one of the two invariant lysines at the catalytic center: Lys263. It is known that this lysine forms a Schiff base link with substrate bound at the enzyme's so-called P-site. The carboxyl group of laevulinic acid makes hydrogen bonds with the side-chain-OH groups of Tyr329 and Ser290, as well as with the main-chain >NH group of Ser290. The aliphatic moiety of the inhibitor makes hydrophobic interactions with surrounding aromatic residues in the protein including Phe219, which resides in the flap covering the active site. Our analysis strongly suggests that the same interactions will be made by P-side substrate and also indicates that the substrate that binds at the enzyme's A-site will interact with the enzyme's zinc ion bound by three cysteines (133, 135, and 143). Inhibitor binding caused a substantial ordering of the active site flap (residues 217-235), which was largely invisible in the native electron density map and indicates that this highly conserved yet flexible region has a specific role in substrate binding during catalysis.
presenilin-1	PS-1	The yeast two-hybrid system, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation techniques were used to identify a novel candidate protein with which presenilin-1 (PS-1) interacts. This interacting protein, the gene of which is encoded on chromosome 16, contains two tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) that are known to mediate interactions between proteins, appears to be primarily localized to the cytoplasm of transfected HEK293 cells, and is expressed in brain. Preliminary yeast two-hybrid data suggests this candidate may interact with both heat shock protein-90 and heat shock protein-70 and thus may be a novel member of TPR-containing proteins which interact with this complex.

negative factor	Nef	The negative factor (Nef) from human and simian immunodeficiency viruses is important for the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Among other targets, it activates the Nef-associated kinase, which is related to the p21-activated kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that Nef activates Ste20, the homolog of p21-activated kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nef binds to the adaptor proteins Bem1 and Ste20 via its proline-rich (PXXP) and diarginine (RR) motifs, respectively. These interactions induce the mitogen-activated protein kinase and increase the rates of budding, sizes of cells, and patterns of mating projections. These effects of Nef depend on the small GTPase Cdc42 and guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24. Thus, studies in S. cerevisiae identified specific interactions between Nef and cellular proteins and their associated signaling cascade. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
glycine- and arginine-rich	GAR	Type I protein arginine N-methyltransferases catalyze the formation of omega-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric omega-NG, NG-dimethylarginine residues using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as the methyl donor. In vitro these enzymes can modify a number of soluble methyl-accepting substrates in yeast and mammalian cell extracts including several species that interact with RNA. We treated normal and hypomethylated Saccharomyces cerevisiae and RAT1 cell extracts with RNase prior to in vitro methylation by recombinant protein N-arginine methyltransferases and found that the methylation of certain polypeptides is enhanced up to 12-fold whereas that of others is diminished. 2-D gel electrophoresis of RNase-treated yeast extracts allowed us to tentatively identify the glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain-containing proteins Gar1, Nop1, Sbp1, and Npl3 as major methyl-acceptors based on their known isoelectric points and apparent molecular weights. These results suggest that the methylation and RNA-binding of GAR domain-containing proteins in vivo may regulate protein-nucleic acid or protein-protein interactions. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
heat shock transcription factors	HSFs	Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are stress-responsive proteins that activate the expression of heat shock genes and are highly conserved from bakers' yeast to humans. Under basal conditions, the human HSF1 protein is maintained as an inactive monomer through intramolecular interactions between two coiled-coil domains and interactions with heat shock proteins; upon environmental, pharmacological, or physiological stress, HSF1 is converted to a homotrimer that binds to its cognate DNA binding site with high affinity. To dissect regions of HSF1 that make important contributions to the stability of the monomer under unstressed conditions, we have used functional complementation in bakers' yeast as a facile assay system. Whereas wild-type human HSF1 is restrained as an inactive monomer in yeast that is unable to substitute for the essential yeast HSF protein, mutations in the linker region between the DNA binding domain and the first coiled-coil allow HSF1 to homotrimerize and rescue the viability defect of a hsfDelta strain. Fine mapping by functional analysis of HSF1-HSF2 chimeras and point mutagenesis revealed that a small region in the amino-terminal portion of the HSF1 linker is required for maintenance of HSF1 in the monomeric state in both yeast and in transfected human 293 cells. Although linker regions in transcription factors are known to modulate DNA binding specificity, our studies suggest that the human HSF1 linker plays no role in determining HSF1 binding preferences in vivo but is a critical determinant in regulating the HSF1 monomer-trimer equilibrium.
p21(Cdc42/Rac)-activated kina	PAK	The Cdc42p GTPase is involved in the signal transduction cascades controlling bud emergence and polarized cell growth in S. cerevisiae. Cells expressing the cdc42(V44A) effector domain mutant allele displayed morphological defects of highly elongated and multielongated budded cells indicative of a defect in the apical-isotropic switch in bud growth. In addition, these cells contained one, two, or multiple nuclei indicative of a G2/M delay in nuclear division and also a defect in cytokinesis and/or cell separation. Actin and chitin were delocalized, and septin ring structure was aberrant and partially delocalized to the tips of elongated cdc42(V44A) cells; however, Cdc42(V44A)p localization was normal. Two-hybrid protein analyses showed that the V44A mutation interfered with Cdc42p's interactions with Cla4p, a p21(Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (PAK)-like kinase, and the novel effectors Gic1p and Gic2p, but not with the Ste20p or Skm1p PAK-like kinases, the Bni1p formin, or the Iqg1p IQGAP homolog. Furthermore, the cdc42(V44A) morphological defects were suppressed by deletion of the Swe1p cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory kinase and by overexpression of Cla4p, Ste20p, the Cdc12 septin protein, or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p. In sum, these results suggest that proper Cdc42p function is essential for timely progression through the apical-isotropic switch and G2/M transition and that Cdc42(V44A)p differentially interacts with a number of effectors and regulators.

untranslated region	5'UTR	A novel form of post-transcriptional control is described. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding the AP1-like transcription factor Yap2 contains two upstream open reading frames (uORF1 and uORF2). The YAP2-type of uORF functions as a cis-acting element that attenuates gene expression at the level of mRNA turnover via termination-dependent decay. Release of post-termination ribosomes from the YAP2 5'UTR causes accelerated decay which is largely independent of the termination modulator gene UPF1. Both of the YAP2 uORFs contribute to the destabilization effect. A G/C-rich stop codon context, which seems to promote ribosome release, allows an uORF to act as a transferable 5'UTR-destabilizing element. Moreover, termination-dependent destabilization is potentiated by stable secondary structure 3' of the uORF stop codon. The potentiation of uORF-mediated destabilization is eliminated if the secondary structure is located further downstream of the uORF, and is also influenced by a modulatory mechanism involving eIF2. Destabilization is therefore linked to the kinetics of acquisition of reinitiation-competence by post-termination ribosomes in the 5'UTR. Our data explain the destabilizing properties of YAP2-type uORFs and also support a more general model for the mode of action of other known uORFs, such as those in the GCN4 mRNA.
salicylic acid	SA	The Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 has been shown to be a key regulator of gene expression during the onset of a plant disease-resistance response known as systemic acquired resistance. The npr1 mutant plants fail to respond to systemic acquired resistance-inducing signals such as salicylic acid (SA), or express SA-induced pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using NPR1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a subclass of transcription factors in the basic leucine zipper protein family (AHBP-1b and TGA6) and showed that they interact specifically in yeast and in vitro with NPR1. Point mutations that abolish the NPR1 function in A. thaliana also impair the interactions between NPR1 and the transcription factors in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, a gel mobility shift assay showed that the purified transcription factor protein, AHBP-1b, binds specifically to an SA-responsive promoter element of the A. thaliana PR-1 gene. These data suggest that NPR1 may regulate PR-1 gene expression by interacting with a subclass of basic leucine zipper protein transcription factors.

dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy	DRPLA	Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neuro degrees enerative disorder associated with CAG/glutamine repeat expansion. While the DRPLA gene is ubiquitously expressed, neuron death occurs in specific anatomical areas of the brain. This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts with other proteins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis. Here, we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product. One of the clones isolated with a yeast two-hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53). The gene produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino acids, respectively. The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the shorter one in other tissues. The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation of cultured cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Binding of the DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies and also by co-localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells expressing engineered constructs. A proline-rich region near the polyglutamine tract of the DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the binding. An extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability in yeast cells, but not in in vitro binding assays. The identification of IRSp53 and other proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA functions in a signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin/IGF-1.

lethal with sec-thirteen	LST	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, vesicles that carry proteins from the ER to the Golgi compartment are encapsulated by COPII coat proteins. We identified mutations in ten genes, designated LST (lethal with sec-thirteen), that were lethal in combination with the COPII mutation sec13-1. LST1 showed synthetic-lethal interactions with the complete set of COPII genes, indicating that LST1 encodes a new COPII function. LST1 codes for a protein similar in sequence to the COPII subunit Sec24p. Like Sec24p, Lst1p is a peripheral ER membrane protein that binds to the COPII subunit Sec23p. Chromosomal deletion of LST1 is not lethal, but inhibits transport of the plasma membrane proton-ATPase (Pma1p) to the cell surface, causing poor growth on media of low pH. Localization by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation shows that the export of Pma1p from the ER is impaired in lst1Delta mutants. Transport of other proteins from the ER was not affected by lst1Delta, nor was Pma1p transport found to be particularly sensitive to other COPII defects. Together, these findings suggest that a specialized form of the COPII coat subunit, with Lst1p in place of Sec24p, is used for the efficient packaging of Pma1p into vesicles derived from the ER.
heme activator protein 1	Hap1	Heme plays key regulatory roles in numerous molecular and cellular processes for systems that sense or use oxygen. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxygen sensing and heme signaling are mediated by heme activator protein 1 (Hap1). Hap1 contains seven heme-responsive motifs (HRMs): six are clustered in the heme domain, and a seventh is near the activation domain. To determine the functional role of HRMs and to define which parts of Hap1 mediate heme regulation, we carried out a systematic analysis of Hap1 mutants with various regions deleted or mutated. Strikingly, the data show that HRM1 to -6, located in the previously designated Hap1 heme domain, have little impact on heme regulation. All seven HRMs are dispensable for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme, but HRM7 is required for Hap1 activation by heme. More importantly, we show that a novel class of repression modules-RPM1, encompassing residues 245 to 278; RPM2, encompassing residues 1061 to 1185; and RPM3, encompassing residues 203 to 244-is critical for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme. Biochemical analysis indicates that RPMs mediate Hap1 repression, at least partly, by the formation of a previously identified higher-order complex termed the high-molecular-weight complex (HMC), while HRMs mediate heme activation by permitting heme binding and the disassembly of the HMC. These findings provide significant new insights into the molecular interactions critical for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme and Hap1 activation by heme.

Insulin receptor substrates	IRS	Insulin receptor substrates (IRS) mediate biological actions of insulin, growth factors, and cytokines. All four mammalian IRS proteins contain pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at their N termini. However, the molecules diverge in their C-terminal sequences. IRS3 is considerably shorter than IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4, and is predicted to interact with a distinct group of downstream signaling molecules. In the present study, we investigated interactions of IRS3 with various signaling molecules. The PTB domain of mIRS3 is necessary and sufficient for binding to the juxtamembrane NPXpY motif of the insulin receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction is stronger if the PH domain or the C-terminal phosphorylation domain is retained in the construct. As determined in a modified yeast two-hybrid system, mIRS3 bound strongly to the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Although high affinity interaction required the presence of at least two of the four YXXM motifs in mIRS3, there was not a requirement for specific YXXM motifs. mIRS3 also bound to SHP2, Grb2, Nck, and Shc, but less strongly than to p85. Studies in COS-7 cells demonstrated that deletion of either the PH or the PTB domain abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mIRS3. Insulin stimulation promoted the association of mIRS3 with p85, SHP2, Nck, and Shc. Despite weak association between mIRS3 and Grb2, this interaction was not increased by insulin, and may not be mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb2. Thus, in contrast to other IRS proteins, mIRS3 appears to have greater specificity for activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway rather than the Grb2/Ras pathway.

ubiquitin	Ub	The structural basis by which ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzymes (E2s) determine substrate specificity remains unclear. We cloned rabbit reticulocyte E217K because unlike the similarly sized class I E2s, E214K and UBC4, it is unable to support ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)-dependent conjugation to endogenous proteins. RNA analysis revealed that this E2 was expressed in all tissues tested, with higher levels in the testis. Analysis of testis RNA from rats of different ages showed that E217K mRNA was induced from days 15 to 30. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that E217K is a 19. 5-kDa class I E2 but differs from other class I enzymes in possessing an insertion of 13 amino acids distal to the active site cysteine. E217K shows 74% amino acid identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBC7, and therefore, we rename it mammalian UBC7. Yeast UBC7 crystal structure indicates that this insertion forms a loop out of the otherwise conserved folding structure. Sequence analysis of E2s had previously suggested that this loop is a hypervariable region and may play a role in substrate specificity. We created mutant UBC7 lacking the loop (ubc7Deltaloop) and a mutant E214k with an inserted loop (E214k+loop) and characterized their biochemical functions. Ubc7Deltaloop had higher affinity for the E1-Ub thiol ester than native UBC7 and permitted conjugation of Ub to selected proteins in the testis but did not permit the broad spectrum E3-dependent conjugation to endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Surprisingly, E214k+loop was unable to accept Ub from ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) but was able to accept NEDD8 from E1. E214k+loop was able to support conjugation of NEDD8 to endogenous reticulocyte proteins but with much lower efficiency than E214k. Thus, the loop can influence interactions of the E2 with charged E1 as well as with E3s or substrates, but the exact nature of these interactions depends on divergent sequences in the remaining conserved core domain.
helper component-proteinase	HC-Pro	Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a screen was performed for possible interactions between the proteins encoded by the 5' region of potyviral genomes [P1, helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), and P3]. A positive self-interaction involving HC-Pro was detected with lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) and potato virus Y (PVY). The possibility of heterologous interaction between the HC-Pro of LMV and of PVY was also demonstrated. No interaction involving either the P1 or the P3 proteins was detected. A series of ordered deletions from either the N- or C-terminal end of the LMV HC-Pro was used to map the domain involved in interaction to the 72 N-terminal amino acids of the protein, a region known to be dispensable for virus viability but necessary for aphid transmission. A similar but less detailed analysis mapped the interacting domain to the N-terminal half of the PVY HC-Pro. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

green fluorescent protein	GFP	The DHH1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to a family of genes that encode highly conserved DEAD-box proteins commonly present in various eukaryotic organisms. Its precise function in yeast has not yet been well documented. To investigate its role in vivo, we constructed a DHH1 disruptant, characterized it genetically and searched for genes the mutations in which would cause synthetic lethality in combination with the DHH1 disruption. CDC28, ELM1 and SSD1 were thus found to be such candidates and we subsequently analysed their interactions. Mutations in ELM1 were previously reported to result in the elongation of cells. We confirmed this phenotype and observed in addition elongated bud formation in an Elm1p overproducing strain. Also, Elm1p fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was found to be localized at the bud neck. These and other observations seem to suggest that Elm1p plays a role during cytokinesis in S. cerevisiae. The phenotypes of strains harbouring either delta dhh1 delta elm1 or ssd1-d delta elm1 were very similar to each other, showing abnormal cellular morphology and defects in cytokinesis and mitosis. Furthermore, DHH1 and SSD1 could functionally complement each other in the ade2 red colour pigment formation, hypersensitivity to SDS, growth on synthetic media and at high temperature. A triple mutant, delta dhh1 ssd1-d delta elm1, apparently had very fragile cell walls and could grow only in a medium supplemented with 1 M sorbitol.
anaphase-promoting complex	APC	Exit from mitosis in all eukaroytes requires inactivation of the mitotic kinase. This occurs principally by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the cyclin subunit controlled by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). However, an abnormal spindle and/or unattached kinetochores activates a conserved spindle checkpoint that blocks APC function. This leads to high mitotic kinase activity and prevents mitotic exit. DBF2 belongs to a group of budding yeast cell cycle genes that when mutated prevent cyclin degradation and block exit from mitosis. DBF2 encodes a protein kinase which is cell cycle regulated, peaking in metaphase-anaphase B/telophase, but its function remains unknown. Here, we show the Dbf2p kinase activity to be a target of the spindle checkpoint. It is controlled specifically by Bub2p, one of the checkpoint components that is conserved in fission yeast and higher eukaroytic cells. Significantly, in budding yeast, Bub2p shows few genetic or biochemical interactions with other members of the spindle checkpoint. Our data now point to the protein kinase Mps1p triggering a new parallel branch of the spindle checkpoint in which Bub2p blocks Dbf2p function.
gene encoding human DNA topoisomerase	topo	The gene encoding human DNA topoisomerase (topo) I, the target of numerous anticancer drugs, has been subcloned into bacterial, yeast and baculovirus-based expression systems in attempts to overexpress the enzyme for extensive structural and functional characterisation. Expression in E.coli produced a protein which was not suitable for structural studies. Expression in the yeast system was more successful enabling the enzyme to be purified and characterised. However, the resulting yield was modest for our requirements and the full-length protein was found to be susceptible to proteolysis when expressed in this system. As it is known that topo I from human placental tissue contains significant quantities of a 68kDa proteolytic fragment which retains both DNA relaxation and cleavage activity, we have isolated this fragment and shown by N-terminal sequence analysis that it starts at Lysine-191. This information was used to construct vectors which direct the overexpression of this fragment in baculovirus infected insect cells. The recombinant protein has been purified to homogeneity in a yield of 5-10mg/l of cell culture. The fragment is stable and retains all of the DNA driving activities of the intact enzyme. We have characterised the interactions of the topo I fragment with synthetic DNA substrates and identified oligonucleotides and conditions that allow covalent complexes between 68kDa topo I and DNA to be formed with high efficiency and in large quantity. A flow linear dichroism technique has been further developed and applied for real-time monitoring of supercoiled (sc) DNA relaxation by the enzyme and for comparative analysis of inhibition of 68kDa topo I by camptothecin (CPT).

tricarboxylic acid cycle	TCA	Genetic and biochemical interactions involving tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) function using a collection of mutants defective in all TCA cycle genes.
tricarboxylic acid	TCA	The eight enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are encoded by at least 15 different nuclear genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have constructed a set of yeast strains defective in these genes as part of a comprehensive analysis of the interactions among the TCA cycle proteins. The 15 major TCA cycle genes can be sorted into five phenotypic categories on the basis of their growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. We have previously reported a novel phenotype associated with mutants defective in the IDH2 gene encoding the Idh2p subunit of the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH). Null and nonsense idh2 mutants grow poorly on glycerol, but growth can be enhanced by extragenic mutations, termed glycerol suppressors, in the CIT1 gene encoding the TCA cycle citrate synthase and in other genes of oxidative metabolism. The TCA cycle mutant collection was utilized to search for other genes that can suppress idh2 mutants and to identify TCA cycle genes that display a similar suppressible growth phenotype on glycerol. Mutations in 7 TCA cycle genes were capable of functioning as suppressors for growth of idh2 mutants on glycerol. The only other TCA cycle gene to display the glycerol-suppressor-accumulation phenotype was IDH1, which encodes the companion Idh1p subunit of NAD-IDH. These results provide genetic evidence that NAD-IDH plays a unique role in TCA cycle function.

capping enzyme RNAtriphosphatase-like 1	CTL1	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA capping enzyme consists of two subunits: the RNA 5'-triphosphatase (Cet1) and the mRNA guanylyltransferase (Ceg1). Using computer homology searching, a S. cerevisiae gene was identified that encodes a protein resembling the C-terminal region of Cet1. Accordingly, we designated this gene CTL1 (capping enzyme RNAtriphosphatase-like 1). CTL1 is not essential for cell viability and no genetic or physical interactions with the capping enzyme genes were observed. The protein is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Recombinant Ctl1 protein releases gamma-phosphate from the 5'-end of RNA to produce a diphosphate terminus. The enzyme is specific for polynucleotide RNA in the presence of magnesium, but becomes specific for nucleotide triphosphates in the presence of manganese. Ctl1 is the second member of the yeast RNA triphosphatase family, but is probably involved in an RNA processing event other than mRNA capping.
Isolation of Ku70-binding proteins	KUBs	Isolation of Ku70-binding proteins (KUBs).
DNA-dependent protein kinase	DNA-PK	DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays a critical role in resealing DNA double-stand breaks by non-homologous end joining. Aside from DNA-PK, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, other proteins which play a role(s) in this repair pathway remain unknown; DNA-PK contains a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a DNA binding subunit (Ku70 and Ku80). We isolated Ku70-binding proteins (KUB1-KUB4) using yeast two-hybrid analyses. Sequence analyses revealed KUB1 to be apolipoprotein J (apoJ), also known as X-ray-inducible transcript 8 (XIP8), testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 (TRPM-2) and clusterin. KUB2 is Ku80. KUB3 and KUB4 are unknown, >10 kb trans-cripts. Interactions of apoJ/XIP8 or KUB3 with Ku70 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in MCF-7:WS8 breast cancer or IMR-90 normal lung fibroblast cells, respectively. The interaction of apoJ/XIP8 with Ku70 was confirmed by far-western analyses. Stable over-expression of full-length apoJ/XIP8 in MCF-7:WS8 caused decreased Ku70/Ku80 DNA end binding that was restored by apoJ/XIP8 monoclonal antibodies. The role of apoJ/XIP8 in ionizing radiation resistance/sensitivity is under investigation.

Interactions of apoJ/XIP8 or KUB3 with Ku70 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in MCF-7:WS8 breast cancer or IMR-90 normal lung fibroblast cells, respectively. The interaction of apoJ/XIP8 with Ku70 was confirmed by far-western analyses. Stable over-expression of full-length apoJ/XIP8 in MCF-7:WS8 caused decreased Ku70/Ku80 DNA end binding that was restored by apoJ/XIP8 monoclonal antibodies. The role of apoJ/XIP8 in ionizing radiation resistance/sensitivity is under investigation.

DNA polymerase III	Pol III	The Escherichia coli dnaQ gene encodes the 3'-->5' exonucleolytic proofreading (epsilon) subunit of DNA polymerase III (Pol III). Genetic analysis of dnaQ mutants has suggested that epsilon might consist of two domains, an N-terminal domain containing the exonuclease and a C-terminal domain essential for binding the polymerase (alpha) subunit. We have created truncated forms of dnaQ resulting in epsilon subunits that contain either the N-terminal or the C-terminal domain. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we analyzed the interactions of the single-domain epsilon subunits with the alpha and theta subunits of the Pol III core. The DnaQ991 protein, consisting of the N-terminal 186 amino acids, was defective in binding to the alpha subunit while retaining normal binding to the theta subunit. In contrast, the NDelta186 protein, consisting of the C-terminal 57 amino acids, exhibited normal binding to the alpha subunit but was defective in binding to the theta subunit. A strain carrying the dnaQ991 allele exhibited a strong, recessive mutator phenotype, as expected from a defective alpha binding mutant. The data are consistent with the existence of two functional domains in epsilon, with the C-terminal domain responsible for polymerase binding.
homologous recombinational repair	HRR	Although it is clear that mammalian somatic cells possess the enzymatic machinery to perform homologous recombination of DNA molecules, the importance of this process in mitigating DNA damage has been uncertain. An initial genetic framework for studying homologous recombinational repair (HRR) has come from identifying relevant genes by homology or by their ability to correct mutants whose phenotypes are suggestive of recombinational defects. While yeast has been an invaluable guide, higher eukaryotes diverge in the details and complexity of HRR. For eliminating DSBs, HRR and end-joining pathways share the burden, with HRR contributing critically during S and G2 phases. It is likely that the removal of interstrand cross-links is absolutely dependent on efficient HRR, as suggested by the extraordinary sensitivity of the ercc1, xpf/ercc4, xrcc2, and xrcc3 mutants to cross-linking chemicals. Similarly, chromosome stability in untreated cells requires intact HRR, which may eliminate DSBs arising during DNA replication and thereby prevent chromosome aberrations. Complex regulation of HRR by cell cycle checkpoint and surveillance functions is suggested not only by direct interactions between human Rad51 and p53, c-Abl, and BRCA2, but also by very high recombination rates in p53-deficient cells.
homologous recombination of DNA double-strand breaks induced by i	IR	Error-free repair by homologous recombination of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR) requires the Rad52 group proteins, including Rad51 and Rad54, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. The formation of a 'joint' molecule between the damaged DNA and the homologous repair template is a key step in recombination mediated by Rad51 and stimulated by Rad54 [2] [3] [4] [5]. Mammalian homologs of Rad51 and Rad54 have been identified [2] [3] [6]. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Rad54 (mRad54) formed IR-induced nuclear foci that colocalized with mRad51. Interaction between mRad51 and mRad54 was induced by genotoxic stress, but only when lesions that required mRad54 for their repair were formed. Interestingly, mRad54 was essential for the formation of IR-induced mRad51 foci. Rad54 belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 protein family, members of which modulate protein-DNA interactions in an ATP-driven manner [7]. Results of a topological assay suggested that purified human Rad54 (hRad54) protein can unwind double-stranded (ds) DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Unwinding of the homologous repair template could promote the formation or stabilization of hRad51-mediated joint molecules. Rad54 appears to be required downstream of other Rad52 group proteins, such as Rad52 and the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, that assist Rad51 in interacting with the broken DNA [2] [3] [4].

nuclear receptors	NRs	Nuclear receptors (NRs) can function as ligandinducible transregulators in both mammalian and yeast cells, indicating that important features of transcriptional control have been conserved throughout evolution. We report here the isolation and characterization of an essential yeast protein of unknown function, PSU1, which exhibits properties expected for a co-activator/mediator of the ligand-dependent activation function AF-2 present in the ligand-binding domain (LBD, region E) of NRs. PSU1 interacts in a ligand-dependent manner with the LBD of several NRs, including retinoic acid (RARalpha), retinoid X (RXRalpha), thyroid hormone (TRalpha), vitamin D3 (VDR) and oestrogen (ERalpha) receptors. Importantly, both in yeast and in vitro, these interactions require the integrity of the AF-2 activating domain. When tethered to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, PSU1 can activate transcription on its own. By using yeast reporter cells that express PSU1 conditionally, we show that PSU1 is required for transactivation by the AF-2 of ERalpha. Taken together these data suggest that in yeast, PSU1 is involved in ligand-dependent transactivation by NRs. Sequence analysis revealed that in addition to a highly conserved motif found in a family of MutT-related proteins, PSU1 contains several alpha-helical leucine-rich motifs sharing the consensus sequence LLxPhiL (x, any amino acid; Phi, hydrophobic amino acid) in regions that elicit either transactivation or NR-binding activity.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein	WASP	Mutations that cause the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome impair the interaction of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) with WASP interacting protein.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome	WAS	Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, immune deficiency, and a proclivity toward lymphoid malignancy. Lymphocytes of affected individuals show defects of activation, motility, and cytoskeletal structure. The disease gene encodes a 502-amino acid protein named the WAS protein (WASP). Studies have identified a number of important interactions that place WASP in a role of integrating signaling pathways with cytoskeletal function. We performed a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with WASP and cloned a proline-rich protein as a specific WASP interactor. Our clone of this protein, termed WASP interacting protein (WIP) by others, shows a difference in seven amino acid residues, compared with the previously published sequence revealing an additional profilin binding motif. Deletion mutant analysis reveals that WASP residues 101-151 are necessary for WASP-WIP interaction. Point mutant analyses in the two-hybrid system and in vitro show impairment of WASP-WIP interaction with three WASP missense mutants known to cause WAS. We conclude that impaired WASP-WIP interaction may contribute to WAS.

guanine-guanine	G-G	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase localizes to the nucleolus and is required to maintain the integrity of the rDNA repeats. Sgs1p is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, which also includes Schizo-saccharomyces pombe Rqh1, and the human BLM and WRN genes. These genes encode proteins which are essential to maintenance of genomic integrity and which share a highly conserved helicase domain. Here we show that recombinant Sgs1p helicase efficiently unwinds guanine-guanine (G-G) paired DNA. Unwinding of G-G paired DNA is ATP- and Mg2+-dependent and requires a short 3' single-stranded tail. Strikingly, Sgs1p unwinds G-G paired substrates more efficiently than duplex DNAs, as measured either in direct assays or by competition experiments. Sgs1p efficiently unwinds G-G paired telomeric sequences, suggesting that one function of Sgs1p may be to prevent telomere-telomere interactions which can lead to chromosome non-disjunction. The rDNA is G-rich and has considerable potential for G-G pairing. Diminished ability to unwind G-G paired regions may also explain the deleterious effect of mutation of Sgs1 on rDNA stability, and the accelerated aging characteristic of yeast strains that lack Sgs1 as well as humans deficient in the related WRN helicase.
wild-type mitochondrial DNA	mtDNA	Mutations in the nuclear AEP2 gene of Saccharomyces generate greatly reduced levels of the mature form of mitochondrial oli1 mRNA, encoding subunit 9 of mitochondrial ATP synthase. A series of mutants was isolated in which the temperature-sensitive phenotype resulting from the aep2-ts1 mutation was suppressed. Three strains were classified as containing a mitochondrial suppressor: these lost the ability to suppress aep2-ts1 when their mitochondrial genome was replaced with wild-type mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Many other isolates were classified as containing dominant nuclear suppressors. The three mitochondrion-encoded suppressors were localized to the oli1 region of mtDNA using rho- genetic mapping techniques coupled with PCR analysis; DNA sequencing revealed, in each case, a T-to-C nucleotide transition in mtDNA 16 nucleotides upstream of the oli1 reading frame. It is inferred that the suppressing mutation in the 5' untranslated region of oli1 mRNA restores subunit 9 biosynthesis by accommodating the modified structure of Aep2p generated by the aep2-ts1 mutation (shown here to cause the substitution of proline for leucine at residue 413 of Aep2p). This mode of mitochondrial suppression is contrasted with that mediated by heteroplasmic rearranged rho- mtDNA genomes bypassing the participation of a nuclear gene product in expression of a particular mitochondrial gene. In the present study, direct RNA-protein interactions are likely to form the basis of suppression.
open reading frame	ORF	Translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a large protein of more than 800 amino acids which establishes complex interactions with the ribosome in order to catalyze the conformational changes needed for translation elongation. Unlike other yeasts, the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was found to have a single gene encoding this factor per haploid genome, located on chromosome 2. Expression of this locus is essential for vegetative growth, as evidenced by placing it under the control of a repressible promoter. This C. albicans gene, named EFT2, was cloned and sequenced (EMBL accession number Y09664). Genomic and cDNA sequence analysis identified common transcription initiation and termination signals and an 842 amino acid open reading frame (ORF), which is interrupted by a single intron. Despite some genetic differences, CaEFT2 was capable of complementing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltaeft1 Deltaeft2 null mutant, which lacks endogenous eEF2, indicating that CaEFT2 can be expressed from its own promoter and its intron can be correctly spliced in S. cerevisiae.
yeast phosphoglycerate kinase	PGK	Site-specific mutants have been produced in order to investigate the role of proline 204 in the 'hinge' region of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This totally conserved proline has been shown to be the only cis-proline in the high resolution crystal structures of yeast, B. stearothermophilus, T. brucei and T. maritima PGK, and may therefore have a role in the independent folding of the two domains or in the 'hinge' bending of the molecule during catalysis. The residue was replaced by a histidine (Pro204His) and a phenylalanine (Pro204Phe), and the resulting proteins characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence emission and kinetic analysis. Although the secondary and tertiary structure of the Pro204His protein is generally similar to that of the wild-type enzyme as assessed by CD, the enzyme is less stable to heat and guanidinium chloride denaturation than the wild-type. In the denaturation experiments two transitions were observed for both the wild-type and the Pro204His mutant, as have been previously reported for yeast PGK [Missiakas, D., Betton, J.M., Minard, P. & Yon, J.M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8683-8689]. The first transition is accompanied by an increase in fluorescence intensity leading to a hyperfluorescent state, followed by the second, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. However, for the Pro204His mutant, the first transition proceeded at lower concentrations of guanidinium chloride and the second transition proceeded to the same extent as for the wild-type protein, suggesting that sequence-distant interactions are more rapidly disrupted in this mutant enzyme than in the wild-type enzyme, while sequence-local interactions are disrupted in a similar way. The Michaelis constants (K(m)) for both 3-phospho-D-glycerate and ATP are increased only by three or fourfold, which confirms that, as expected, the substrate binding sites are largely unaffected by the mutation. However, the turnover and efficiency of the Pro204His mutant is severely impaired, indicating that the mechanism of 'hinge' bending is hindered. The Pro204Phe enzyme was shown to be significantly less well folded than the wild-type and Pro204His enzymes, with considerable loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. It is proposed that the proline residue at 204 in the 'hinge' region of PGK plays a role in the stability and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.

hepatitis B virus	HBV	The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of three related proteins known as the large (L), middle (M) and small (S) hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg). L-HBsAg has a 108-119 amino acid extension at the N terminus compared with M-HBsAg and contains the preS1 sequence of the HBV envelope. Previous research has identified this region as the likely virus attachment protein which is thought to interact with the cellular receptor for the virus. However, as the receptor has still not been identified unequivocally, we used the preS1 region of L-HBsAg to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were isolated which encoded cellular proteins that interacted with the HBV preS1 protein. The specificity was examined in an independent manner in experiments in which baculovirus-derived glutathione S-transferase (GST)-preS1 was incubated with 35S-labelled protein expressed by in vitro translation from the positive clones. The intensity of the interactions using this alternative approach mirrored those observed in the yeast two-hybrid system and two proteins (an unidentified protein and a mitochondrial protein) were selected for further study. The specificity of the binding reaction between the preS1 protein and these two proteins was further confirmed in a competition assay; HBV purified from serum, but not purified HBsAg, was able to compete with preS1 and thus block GST-preS1 binding to the unidentified protein but not to the mitochondrial protein. The unidentified protein was then expressed as a fusion protein with GST and this was able to bind HBV virions in a direct manner.

The unidentified protein was then expressed as a fusion protein with GST and this was able to bind HBV virions in a direct manner.
hepatitis B surface antigens	S	The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of three related proteins known as the large (L), middle (M) and small (S) hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg). L-HBsAg has a 108-119 amino acid extension at the N terminus compared with M-HBsAg and contains the preS1 sequence of the HBV envelope. Previous research has identified this region as the likely virus attachment protein which is thought to interact with the cellular receptor for the virus. However, as the receptor has still not been identified unequivocally, we used the preS1 region of L-HBsAg to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were isolated which encoded cellular proteins that interacted with the HBV preS1 protein. The specificity was examined in an independent manner in experiments in which baculovirus-derived glutathione S-transferase (GST)-preS1 was incubated with 35S-labelled protein expressed by in vitro translation from the positive clones. The intensity of the interactions using this alternative approach mirrored those observed in the yeast two-hybrid system and two proteins (an unidentified protein and a mitochondrial protein) were selected for further study.

green fluorescent protein	GFP	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, positioning of the mitotic spindle requires both the cytoplasmic microtubules and actin. Kar9p is a novel cortical protein that is required for the correct position of the mitotic spindle and the orientation of the cytoplasmic microtubules. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)- Kar9p localizes to a single spot at the tip of the growing bud and the mating projection. However, the cortical localization of Kar9p does not require microtubules (Miller, R.K., and M.D. Rose. 1998. J. Cell Biol. 140: 377), suggesting that Kar9p interacts with other proteins at the cortex. To investigate Kar9p's cortical interactions, we treated cells with the actin-depolymerizing drug, latrunculin-A. In both shmoos and mitotic cells, Kar9p's cortical localization was completely dependent on polymerized actin. Kar9p localization was also altered by mutations in four genes, spa2Delta, pea2Delta, bud6Delta, and bni1Delta, required for normal polarization and actin cytoskeleton functions and, of these, bni1Delta affected Kar9p localization most severely. Like kar9Delta, bni1Delta mutants exhibited nuclear positioning defects during mitosis and in shmoos. Furthermore, like kar9Delta, the bni1Delta mutant exhibited misoriented cytoplasmic microtubules in shmoos. Genetic analysis placed BNI1 in the KAR9 pathway for nuclear migration. However, analysis of kar9Delta bni1Delta double mutants suggested that Kar9p retained some function in bni1Delta mitotic cells. Unlike the polarization mutants, kar9Delta shmoos had a normal morphology and diploids budded in the correct bipolar pattern. Furthermore, Bni1p localized normally in kar9Delta. We conclude that Kar9p's function is specific for cytoplasmic microtubule orientation and that Kar9p's role in nuclear positioning is to coordinate the interactions between the actin and microtubule networks.
spindle pole body	SPB	Alignment of the mitotic spindle with the axis of cell division is an essential process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is mediated by interactions between cytoplasmic microtubules and the cell cortex. We found that a cortical protein, the yeast formin Bni1p, was required for spindle orientation. Two striking abnormalities were observed in bni1Delta cells. First, the initial movement of the spindle pole body (SPB) toward the emerging bud was defective. This phenotype is similar to that previously observed in cells lacking the kinesin Kip3p and, in fact, BNI1 and KIP3 were found to be in the same genetic pathway. Second, abnormal pulling interactions between microtubules and the cortex appeared to cause preanaphase spindles in bni1Delta cells to transit back and forth between the mother and the bud. We therefore propose that Bni1p may localize or alter the function of cortical microtubule-binding sites in the bud. Additionally, we present evidence that other bipolar bud site determinants together with cortical actin are also required for spindle orientation.
RNA polymerase II	PolII	The Mediator complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for both general and regulated transcription of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and is composed of two stable subcomplexes (Srb4 and Rgr1 subcomplexes). To decipher the function of each Mediator subcomplex and to delineate the functional relationship between the subcomplexes, we characterized the compositions and biochemical activities of PolII-Mediator complexes (holoenzymes) prepared from several Mediator mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. We found that holoenzymes devoid of a functional Gal11 module were defective for activated but not basal transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system. This activation-specific defect was correlated with a crippled physical interaction to transcriptional activator proteins, which could be bypassed by artificial recruitment of a mutant holoenzyme to a promoter. Consistent with this observation, a direct interaction between Gal11 and gene-specific transcriptional activator proteins was detected by far-Western analyses and column binding assays. In contrast, the srb5 deletion mutant holoenzyme was defective for both basal and activated transcription, despite its capacity for activator binding that is comparable to that of the wild-type holoenzyme. These results demonstrate that the Gal11 module of the Rgr1 subcomplex is required for the efficient recruitment of PolII holoenzyme to a promoter via activator-specific interactions, while the Srb4 subcomplex functions in the modulation of general polymerase activity.
origin recognition complex	ORC	The origin recognition complex (ORC) was originally identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a protein that specifically binds to origins of DNA replication. Although ORC appears to play an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication in the cells of all eukaryotes, its interactions with DNA have not been defined in species other than budding yeast. We have characterized a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of the ORC subunit, Orc4p. The homologue (Orp4p) consists of two distinct functional domains. The C-terminal domain shows strong sequence similarity to human, frog, and yeast Orc4 proteins, including conserved ATP-binding motifs. The N-terminal domain contains nine copies of the AT-hook motif found in a number of DNA-binding proteins, including the members of the HMG-I(Y) family of chromatin proteins. AT-hook motifs are known from biochemical and structural studies to mediate binding to the minor groove of AT-tracts in DNA. Orp4p is essential for viability of Sc. pombe and is expressed throughout the cell cycle. The Orp4 protein (and its isolated N-terminal domain) binds to the Sc. pombe replication origin, ars1. The DNA binding properties of Orp4p provide a plausible explanation for the characteristic features of Sc. pombe origins of replication, which differ significantly from those of Sa. cerevisiae.
sickle haemoglobin	Hb	Mutational analysis of sickle haemoglobin (Hb) gelation.
human sickle Hb	Hb	The use of recombinant Hb has provided the advantage that any amino acid substitution can be made at sites not represented by natural mutants or that cannot be modified by chemical procedures. We have recently reported the expression of human sickle Hb (HbS) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that carries a plasmid containing the human alpha- and beta-globin cDNA sequences; N-terminal nascent protein processing is correct and a soluble correctly folded Hb tetramer is produced. The yeast system produces a recombinant sickle Hb that is identical by about a dozen biochemical and physiological criteria with the natural sickle Hb purified from the red cells of sickle-cell anaemia patients. Most importantly, the gelling concentration of this recombinant sickle Hb is the same as that of the HbS purified from human sickle red cells. The misfolding of Hb reported for the Escherichia coli-expressed protein is not apparent for Hb expressed in yeast by any of the criteria that we have used for characterization. These findings indicate that this system is well suited to the production of HbS mutants to explore those areas of the HbS tetramer whose roles in the gelation process are not yet defined and to measure quantitatively the strength of such interactions at certain inter-tetrameric contact sites in the deoxy-HbS aggregate. This article reviews our studies on a number of sickle Hb mutants, including polymerization-enhancing HbS mutants and polymerization-inhibiting HbS mutants.
Brome mosaic virus	BMV	Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, encodes two RNA replication proteins. The 1a protein has putative helicase and RNA-capping domains, whereas 2a contains a polymerase-like domain. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 1a and 2a is capable of replicating a BMV RNA3 template produced by in vivo transcription of a DNA copy of RNA3. Although insufficient for RNA3 replication, the expression of 1a protein alone results in a dramatic and specific stabilization of the RNA3 template in yeast. As one step toward understanding 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3, the interactions involved, and its possible relation to RNA replication, we have identified the cis-acting sequences required for this effect. We find that 1a-induced stabilization is mediated by a 150- to 190-base segment of the RNA3 intergenic region corresponding to a previously identified enhancer of RNA3 replication. Moreover, this segment is sufficient to confer 1a-induced stability on a heterologous beta-globin RNA. Within this intergenic segment, partial deletions that inhibited 1a-induced stabilization in yeast expressing 1a alone resulted in parallel decreases in the levels of negative- and positive-strand RNA3 replication products in yeast expressing 1a and 2a. In particular, a small deletion encompassing a motif corresponding to the box B element of RNA polymerase III promoters dramatically reduced the ability of RNAs to respond to 1a or 1a and 2a. These and other findings suggest that 1a-induced stabilization likely reflects an early template selection step in BMV RNA replication.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	Ras-related, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Ypt/Rab family play a key role at defined steps in vesicular transport, both in yeast and in mammalian cells. In yeast, Ypt1p has an essential function late in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport, and the redundant Ypt31/Ypt32 GTPases have been proposed to act in transport through and/or from the Golgi. Here we report that mutant alleles of YPT31 and YPT32, whose gene products have a reduced affinity for GTP, are able to suppress the dominant lethal phenotype of YPT1(N121I). Co-expression of YPT1(N121I) and the suppressor YPT31(N126I) allow essentially undisturbed secretory transport in the absence of the respective wild-type GTPases. Such mutant cells massively overaccumulate 60-100 nm vesicles and are heat sensitive. It appears likely that the mutant GTPases, which are defective in nucleotide binding, compete for the binding of common interacting protein(s). These and other genetic interactions between YPT1, YPT31/32, ARF1 and SEC4 described here strongly support the view that Ypt31p and Ypt32p have a central, Golgi-associated function in anterograde or retrograde transport.
human MSH5	hMSH5	MutS homologues have been identified in nearly all organisms examined to date. They play essential roles in maintaining mitotic genetic fidelity and meiotic segregation fidelity. MutS homologues appear to function as a molecular switch that signals genomic manipulation events. Here we describe the identification of the human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH5, which is known to participate in meiotic segregation fidelity and crossing-over. The human MSH5 (hMSH5) was localized to chromosome 6p22-21 and appears to play a role in meiosis because expression is induced during spermatogenesis between the late primary spermatocytes and the elongated spermatid phase. hMSH5 interacts specifically with hMSH4, confirming the generality of functional heterodimeric interactions in the eukaryotic MutS homologue, which also includes hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6.
polymorphonuclear leukocytes	PMNs	Serum-free culture filtrates of six Candida species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found to contain chemoattractants for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and a mouse macrophage-like cell line, J774. The chemotactic factors differed for the PMN and J774 cells, however, in terms of heat stability, kinetics of liberation by the yeast cells, and divalent cation requirements for production. The chemoattractant in Candida albicans culture filtrates appeared to act through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) of PMNs, since it was found to induce chemotaxis of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were expressing the human FPR but did not induce chemotaxis of wild-type CHO cells. The C. albicans culture filtrates also induced migration of PMNs across confluent monolayers of a human gastrointestinal epithelial cell line, T84; migration occurred in the basolateral-to-apical direction but not the reverse direction, unless the epithelial tight junctions were disrupted. J774 cells did not migrate toward the formylated peptide (fMet-Leu-Phe; fMLF), and chemotaxis toward the C. albicans culture filtrate was not inhibited by an FPR antagonist (t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe), suggesting that a different receptor mediated J774 cell chemotaxis. In conclusion, we have identified a receptor by which a non-serum-dependent chemotactic factor (NSCF) produced by C. albicans induced chemotaxis of PMNs. Additionally, we have shown that NSCF was active across epithelial monolayers. These findings suggest that NSCFs produced by C. albicans and other yeast species may influence host-pathogen interactions at the gastrointestinal tract mucosal surface by inducing phagocytic-cell infiltration.

Fibronectin	Fn	Fibronectin (Fn) binds to fibrin in clots by covalent and non-covalent interactions. The N- and C-termini of Fn each contain one non-covalent fibrin-binding site, which are composed of type 1 (F1) structural repeats. We have previously localized the N-terminal site to the fourth and fifth F1 repeats (4F1.5F1). In the current studies, using proteolytic and recombinant proteins representing both the N- and C-terminal fibrin-binding regions, we localized and characterized the C-terminal fibrin-binding site, compared the relative fibrin-binding activities of both sites and determined the contribution of each site to the fibrin-binding activity of intact Fn. By fibrin-affinity chromatography, a protein composed of the 10F1 repeat through to the C-terminus of Fn (10F1-COOH), expressed in COS-1 cells, and 10F1-12F1, produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, displayed fibrin-binding activity. However, since 10F1 and 10F1.11F1 were not active, the presence of 12F1 is required for fibrin binding. A proteolytic fragment of 14.4 kDa, beginning 14 residues N-terminal to 10F1, was isolated from the fibrin-affinity matrix. Radio-iodinated 14.4 kDa fibrin-binding peptide/protein (FBP) demonstrated a dose-dependent and saturable binding to fibrin-coated wells that was both competitively inhibited and reversed by unlabelled 14.4 kDa FBP. Comparison of the fibrin-binding affinities of proteolytic FBPs from the N-terminus (25.9 kDa FBP), the C-terminus (14.4 kDa) and intact Fn by ELISA yielded estimated Kd values of 216, 18 and 2.1 nM, respectively. The higher fibrin-binding affinity of the N-terminus was substantiated by the ability of both a recombinant 4F1.5F1 and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to this site to maximally inhibit biotinylated Fn binding to fibrin by 80%, and by blocking the 90% inhibitory activity of a polyclonal anti-Fn, by absorption with the 25.9 kDa FBP. We propose that whereas the N-terminal site appears to contribute to most of the binding activity of native Fn to fibrin, the specific binding of the C-terminal site may strengthen this interaction.

clones encoding keratin 18	K18	The 180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2) is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein, also known as type XVII collagen. In this study, potential interactions of BPAG2 with other proteins expressed in epidermal keratinocytes were explored by yeast two-hybrid system using the amino-terminal intracellular domain of BPAG2 as a bait. Several independent interacting clones encoding keratin 18 (K18) were identified when the keratinocyte cDNA library, cloned into the yeast two-hybrid activation domain vector, was screened. The peptide sequence responsible for the interaction of BPAG2 was restricted to amino acids 15-25, and substitution of a valine residue in the middle of this sequence by a proline (V23P) by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the interaction. Further examination of the K18 sequences by restricted cDNA constructs in yeast two-hybrid system identified a carboxyl-terminal segment corresponding to helix 2B domain as critical for BPAG2 binding. The interaction of BPAG2/K18 was confirmed by an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, which also confirmed that normal human keratinocytes express K18 in culture. The tissue specific expression of BPAG2 was first examined using a multi-tissue RNA blot. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels representing a variety of adult and fetal tissues as well as tumor cells were used as PCR-templates to study the expression patterns of both BPAG2 and K18. The results demonstrated significant level of expression of BPAG2, besides in epidermal keratinocytes, also in a variety of tissues with predominant epithelial component, such as mammary, salivary and thyroid glands, colon, prostate, testis, placenta, and adult and fetal thymus, as well as in colon, pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, and an ovarian carcinoma. As expected, K18 transcript is present in liver, pancreas, colon, placenta, and in fetal kidney. Collectively, the results suggest that BPAG2 has a relatively broad tissue distribution including specialized and simple epithelia, and that within the tissues such as colon and placenta, BPAG2 may have direct interactions with K18, a keratin characteristically expressed in a simple epithelia.
small nuclear RNAs	snRNAs	Pseudouridine mapping in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosomal U small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) reveals that pseudouridine synthase pus1p exhibits a dual substrate specificity for U2 snRNA and tRNA.
Pseudouridine	Psi	Pseudouridine (Psi) residues were localized in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosomal U small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) by using the chemical mapping method. In contrast to vertebrate UsnRNAs, S. cerevisiae UsnRNAs contain only a few Psi residues, which are located in segments involved in intermolecular RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. At these positions, UsnRNAs are universally modified. When yeast mutants disrupted for one of the several pseudouridine synthase genes (PUS1, PUS2, PUS3, and PUS4) or depleted in rRNA-pseudouridine synthase Cbf5p were tested for UsnRNA Psi content, only the loss of the Pus1p activity was found to affect Psi formation in spliceosomal UsnRNAs. Indeed, Psi44 formation in U2 snRNA was abolished. By using purified Pus1p enzyme and in vitro-produced U2 snRNA, Pus1p is shown here to catalyze Psi44 formation in the S. cerevisiae U2 snRNA. Thus, Pus1p is the first UsnRNA pseudouridine synthase characterized so far which exhibits a dual substrate specificity, acting on both tRNAs and U2 snRNA. As depletion of rRNA-pseudouridine synthase Cbf5p had no effect on UsnRNA Psi content, formation of Psi residues in S. cerevisiae UsnRNAs is not dependent on the Cbf5p-snoRNA guided mechanism.

heat shock factor	HSF	Previous work has shown that heat shock factor (HSF) plays a central role in remodeling the chromatin structure of the yeast HSP82 promoter via constitutive interactions with its high-affinity binding site, heat shock element 1 (HSE1). The HSF-HSE1 interaction is also critical for stimulating both basal (noninduced) and induced transcription. By contrast, the function of the adjacent, inducibly occupied HSE2 and -3 is unknown. In this study, we examined the consequences of mutations in HSE1, HSE2, and HSE3 on HSF binding and transactivation. We provide evidence that in vivo, HSF binds to these three sites cooperatively. This cooperativity is seen both before and after heat shock, is required for full inducibility, and can be recapitulated in vitro on both linear and supercoiled templates. Quantitative in vitro footprinting reveals that occupancy of HSE2 and -3 by Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSF (ScHSF) is enhanced approximately 100-fold through cooperative interactions with the HSF-HSE1 complex. HSE1 point mutants, whose basal transcription is virtually abolished, are functionally compensated by cooperative interactions with HSE2 and -3 following heat shock, resulting in robust inducibility. Using a competition binding assay, we show that the affinity of recombinant HSF for the full-length HSP82 promoter is reduced nearly an order of magnitude by a single-point mutation within HSE1, paralleling the effect of these mutations on noninduced transcript levels. We propose that the remodeled chromatin phenotype previously shown for HSE1 point mutants (and lost in HSE1 deletion mutants) stems from the retention of productive, cooperative interactions between HSF and its target binding sites.

protein phosphatase type 2C	PP2C	Symbiotic interactions between legumes and compatible strains of rhizobia result in root nodule formation. This new plant organ provides the unique physiological environment required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation by the bacterial endosymbiont and assimilation of this nitrogen by the plant partner. We have isolated two related genes (LjNPP2C1 and LjPP2C2) from the model legume Lotus japonicus that encode protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C). Expression of the LjNPP2C1 gene was found to be enhanced specifically in L. japonicus nodules, whereas the LjPP2C2 gene was expressed at a similar level in nodules and roots. A glutathione S-transferase-LjNPP2C1 fusion protein was shown to have Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent and okadaic acid-insensitive PP2C activity in vitro. A chimeric construct containing the full-length LjNPP2C1 cDNA, under the control of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, was found to be able to complement a yeast PP2C-deficient mutant (pct1Delta). The transcript level of the LjNPP2C1 gene was found to increase significantly in mature nodules, and its highest expression level occurred after leghemoglobin (lb) gene induction, a molecular marker for late developmental events in nodule organogenesis. Expression of the LjNPP2C1 gene was found to be drastically altered in specific L. japonicus lines carrying monogenic-recessive mutations in symbiosis-related loci, suggesting that the product of the LjNPP2C1 gene may function at both early and late stages of nodule development.

yeast protein Set1p	TPE	The yeast protein Set1p, inactivation of which alleviates telomeric position effect (TPE), contains a conserved SET domain present in chromosomal proteins involved in epigenetic control of transcription. Mec3p is required for efficient DNA-damage-dependent checkpoints at G1/S, intra-S and G2/M (refs 3-7). We show here that the SET domain of Set1p interacts with Mec3p. Deletion of SET1 increases the viability of mec3delta mutants after DNA damage (in a process that is mostly independent of Rad53p kinase, which has a central role in checkpoint control) but does not significantly affect cell-cycle progression. Deletion of MEC3 enhances TPE and attenuates the Set1delta-induced silencing defect. Furthermore, restoration of TPE in a Set1delta mutant by overexpression of the isolated SET domain requires Mec3p. Finally, deletion of MEC3 results in telomere elongation, whereas cells with deletions of both SET1 and MEC3 do not have elongated telomeres. Our findings indicate that interactions between SET1 and MEC3 have a role in DNA repair and telomere function.
nuclear pore complex	NPC	Integral membrane proteins associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) are likely to play an important role in the biogenesis of this structure. Here we have examined the functional roles of domains of the yeast pore membrane protein Pom152p in establishing its topology and its interactions with other NPC proteins. The topology of Pom152p was evaluated by alkaline extraction, protease protection, and endoglycosidase H sensitivity assays. The results of these experiments suggest that Pom152p contains a single transmembrane segment with its N terminus (amino acid residues 1-175) extending into the nuclear pore and its C terminus (amino acid residues 196-1337) positioned in the lumen of the nuclear envelope. The functional role of these different domains was investigated in mutants that are dependent on Pom152p for viability. The requirement for Pom152p in strains containing mutations allelic to the NPC protein genes NIC96 and NUP59 could be alleviated by Pom152p's N terminus, independent of its integration into the membrane. However, complementation of a mutation in NUP170 required both the N terminus and the transmembrane segment. Furthermore, mutations in NUP188 were rescued only by full-length Pom152p, suggesting that the lumenal structures play an important role in the function of pore-side NPC structures.
dimerization domain of the estrogen receptor-alpha	ER	We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to localize the ligand-dependent dimerization domain of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) to region E in vivo. In this system, the cDNAs corresponding to the A-D, E, E/F, A-E (deltaF), and full-length (wtER) domains of the human ER were each cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors GAL4 DB and GAL4 TA and expressed in different combinations in yeast harboring a GAL1-lacZ reporter. The reporter was used as a relative measure of the interaction between the ER domains, through reconstitution of GAL4 activity. We found that the interaction of E or E/F domains of the ER with full-length ER is estradiol dependent and estrogen responsive element independent, as measured by the reconstitution of GAL4 activity from GAL4-E domain-containing fusion protein interactions. In the presence of F domain, this activity is reduced 10-fold. The results suggest that sequences in the F domain are inhibitory to the dimerization signal that is present in the E region. We propose that the full-length ER contains intrinsic dimerization restraints contributed by regions outside domain E that are released upon binding hormone agonist. In addition, we have demonstrated that coactivator RIP140 is able to interact with the ER in vivo at the E domain of the receptor in the presence of estrogen. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that RIP140 does not homodimerize in the presence or absence of estrogens. We present evidence showing that the ER has the inherent ability to interact with RIP140 in the presence of antiestrogens, but sequences inherent in the ER itself that are present outside of the E domain compromise this ability.
ubiquitin	Ub	The split-ubiquitin technique was used to detect transient protein interactions in living cells. Nub, the N-terminal half of ubiquitin (Ub), was fused to Sec62p, a component of the protein translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cub, the C-terminal half of Ub, was fused to the C terminus of a signal sequence. The reconstitution of a quasi-native Ub structure from the two halves of Ub, and the resulting cleavage by Ub-specific proteases at the C terminus of Cub, serve as a gauge of proximity between the two test proteins linked to Nub and Cub. Using this assay, we show that Sec62p is spatially close to the signal sequence of the prepro-alpha-factor in vivo. This proximity is confined to the nascent polypeptide chain immediately following the signal sequence. In addition, the extent of proximity depends on the nature of the signal sequence. Cub fusions that bore the signal sequence of invertase resulted in a much lower Ub reconstitution with Nub-Sec62p than otherwise identical test proteins bearing the signal sequence of prepro-alpha-factor. An inactive derivative of Sec62p failed to interact with signal sequences in this assay. These in vivo findings are consistent with Sec62p being part of a signal sequence-binding complex.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5	Cdk5	Munc18a, a mammalian neuronal homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec1p protein, is essential for secretion, likely as a result of its high affinity interaction with the target SNARE protein syntaxin 1a (where SNARE is derived from SNAP receptor (the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)). However, this interaction inhibits vesicle SNARE interactions with syntaxin that are required for secretory vesicles to achieve competency for membrane fusion. As such, regulation of the interaction between Munc18a and syntaxin 1a may provide an important mechanism controlling secretory responsiveness. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a member of the Cdc2 family of cell division kinases, co-purifies with Munc18a from rat brain, interacts directly with Munc18a in vitro, and utilizes Munc18a as a substrate for phosphorylation. We have now demonstrated that Cdk5 is capable of phosphorylating Munc18a in vitro within a preformed Munc18a.syntaxin 1a heterodimer complex and that this results in the disassembly of the complex. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the Cdk5 phosphorylation site on Munc18a was identified as Thr574. Stimulation of secretion from neuroendocrine cells produced a corresponding rapid translocation of cytosolic Cdk5 to a particulate fraction and an increase of Cdk5 kinase activity. Inhibition of Cdk5 with olomoucine decreased evoked norepinephrine secretion from chromaffin cells, an effect not observed with the inactive analogue iso-olomoucine. The effects of olomoucine were independent of calcium influx as evidenced by secretory inhibition in permeabilized chromaffin cells and in cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. Furthermore, transfection and expression in chromaffin cells of a neural specific Cdk5 activator, p25, led to a strong increase in nicotinic agonist-induced secretory responses. Our data suggest a model whereby Cdk5 acts to regulate Munc18a interaction with syntaxin 1a and thereby modulates the level of vesicle SNARE interaction with syntaxin 1a and secretory responsiveness.
tetratricopeptide repeat	TPR	Regulation of Hsp90 ATPase activity by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-domain co-chaperones.
heat shock protein 90	Hsp90	The in vivo function of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) molecular chaperone is dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP, and on interactions with a variety of co-chaperones containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. We have now analysed the interaction of the yeast TPR-domain co-chaperones Sti1 and Cpr6 with yeast Hsp90 by isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, and determined the effect of their binding on the inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90. Sti1 and Cpr6 both bind with sub-micromolar affinity, with Sti1 binding accompanied by a large conformational change. Two co-chaperone molecules bind per Hsp90 dimer, and Sti1 itself is found to be a dimer in free solution. The inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90 is completely inhibited by binding of Sti1, but is not affected by Cpr6, although Cpr6 can reactivate the ATPase activity by displacing Sti1 from Hsp90. Bound Sti1 makes direct contact with, and blocks access to the ATP-binding site in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90. These results reveal an important role for TPR-domain co-chaperones as regulators of the ATPase activity of Hsp90, showing that the ATP-dependent step in Hsp90-mediated protein folding occurs after the binding of the folding client protein, and suggesting that ATP hydrolysis triggers client-protein release.

GTPase-activating proteins	GAPs	ARF proteins, which mediate vesicular transport, have little or no intrinsic GTPase activity. They rely on the actions of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for their function. The in vitro GTPase activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARF proteins Arf1 and Arf2 is stimulated by the yeast Gcs1 protein, and in vivo genetic interactions between arf and gcs1 mutations implicate Gcs1 in vesicular transport. However, the Gcs1 protein is dispensable, indicating that additional ARF GAP proteins exist. We show that the structurally related protein Glo3, which is also dispensable, also exhibits ARF GAP activity. Genetic and in vitro approaches reveal that Glo3 and Gcs1 have an overlapping essential function at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi stage of vesicular transport. Mutant cells deficient for both ARF GAPs cannot proliferate, undergo a dramatic accumulation of ER and are defective for protein transport between ER and Golgi. The glo3Delta and gcs1Delta single mutations each interact with a sec21 mutation that affects a component of COPI, which mediates vesicular transport within the ER-Golgi shuttle, while increased dosage of the BET1, BOS1 and SEC22 genes encoding members of a v-SNARE family that functions within the ER-Golgi alleviates the effects of a glo3Delta mutation. An in vitro assay indicates that efficient retrieval from the Golgi to the ER requires these two proteins. These findings suggest that Glo3 and Gcs1 ARF GAPs mediate retrograde vesicular transport from the Golgi to the ER.

src homology 3	SH3	Impairment of endocytosis by mutational targeting of dynamin-1 GTPases can result in paralysis and embryonic lethality. Dynamin-1 assembles at coated pits where it functions to cleave vesicles from donor membranes. Receptor endocytosis is modulated by SH3 (src homology 3) domain proteins, which directly bind to dynamin C-terminal proline motif sequences, affecting both the dynamin GTPase activity and its recruitment to coated pits. We have determined that dynamin-dynamin interactions, which are required for dynamin helix formation, involve these same SH3 domain-binding C-terminal proline motif sequences. Consequently, SH3 domain proteins induce the in vitro disassembly of dynamin helices. Our results therefore suggest the the dual function of the dynamin C-terminus (involving amino acids 800-840) permits direct regulation of dynamin assembly and function through interaction with SH3 domain proteins. Additionally, the N-terminal GTPase domain plays an important role in assembly. Finally, we show that the central PH (pleckstrin homology) domain exerts a strong inhibitory effect on the capacity for dynamin-1 self-assembly.

self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein	GAP	Signal transduction through the Rho family GTPases requires regulated cycling of the GTPases between the active GTP-bound state and the inactive GDP-bound state. Rho family members containing an arginine residue at position 186 in the C-terminal polybasic region were found to possess a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity through homophilic interaction, resulting in significantly enhanced intrinsic GTPase activities. This arginine residue functions effectively as an "arginine finger" in the GTPase activating reaction to confer the catalytic GAP activity but is not essential for the homophilic binding interactions of Rho family proteins. The arginine 186-mediated negative regulation seems to be absent from Cdc42, a Rho family member important for cell-division cycle regulation, of lower eukaryotes, yet appears to be a part of the turn-off machinery of Cdc42 from higher eukaryotes. Introduction of the arginine 186 mutation into S. cerevisiae CDC42 led to phenotypes consistent with down-regulated CDC42 function. Thus, specific Rho family GTPases may utilize a built-in arginine finger, in addition to RhoGAPs, for negative regulation.
ATP-binding cassette	ABC	The GTS1 gene product, Gts1p, has pleiotropic effects on the timing of budding, cell size, heat tolerance, sporulation and the lifespan of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we found (using the yeast two-hybrid system) that Gts1p forms homodimers throughout the 18-amino acid region 296-313 which has considerable similarity to a region downstream of the Walker nucleotide-binding motif A of some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The region contains two aspartic acid residues at 301 and 310 preceded by hydrophobic amino acid residues, and Gts1p with an Asp310 to Ala substitution showed considerably reduced homodimerization, as shown by the two-hybrid assay. Overexpression of the point-mutated Gts1p did not efficiently induce the Gts1p-related phenotypes described above, suggesting that the homodimerization of Gts1p is required for it to function in vivo. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the yeast ABC transporters Mdl1p (multidrug resistance-like transporter) and Ycf1p (yeast cadmium factor or glutathione S-conjugate pump) bound to Gts1p in the two-hybrid system, and the heterodimerization activity of the Gts1p with the Asp301 to Ala substitution was more affected than the Gts1p with the Asp310 to Ala substitution. Overexpression of GTS1 considerably reduced, and disruption of GTS1 slightly decreased, cellular resistance to cycloheximide, cadmium, cisplatin and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrophenol, which (except for cycloheximide) are all substrates of Ycf1p. These results suggest that Gts1p interacts with some ABC transporters through the binding site overlapping that of homodimerization and modulates their activity.
gamma-aminobutyric acid	GABA	Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin. Here we identify a new cellular protein, GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which can interact with the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. GABARAP binds to GABA(A) receptors both in vitro and in vivo, and co-localizes with the punctate staining of GABA(A) receptors on cultured cortical neurons. Sequence analysis shows similarity between GABARAP and light chain-3 of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B. Moreover, the N terminus of GABARAP is highly positively charged and features a putative tubulin-binding motif. The interactions among GABA(A) receptors, GABARAP and tubulin suggest a mechanism for the targeting and clustering of GABA(A) receptors.

nuclear pore complex	NPC	Proteins to be transported into the nucleus are recognized by members of the importin-karyopherin nuclear transport receptor family. After docking at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the cargo-receptor complex moves through the aqueous pore channel. Once cargo is released, the importin then moves back through the channel for new rounds of transport. Thus, importin and exportin, another member of this family involved in export, are thought to continuously shuttle between the nuclear interior and the cytoplasm. In order to understand how nuclear transporters traverse the NPC, we constructed functional protein fusions between several members of the yeast importin family, including Pse1p, Sxm1p, Xpo1p, and Kap95p, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Complexes containing nuclear transporters were isolated by using highly specific anti-GFP antibodies. Pse1-GFP was studied in the most detail. Pse1-GFP is in a complex with importin-alpha and -beta (Srp1p and Kap95p in yeast cells) that is sensitive to the nucleotide-bound state of the Ran GTPase. In addition, Pse1p associates with the nucleoporins Nsp1p, Nup159p, and Nup116p, while Sxm1p, Xpo1p, and Kap95p show different patterns of interaction with nucleoporins. Association of Pse1p with nucleoporins also depends on the nucleotide-bound state of Ran; when Ran is in the GTP-bound state, the nucleoporin association is lost. A mutant form of Pse1p that does not bind Ran also fails to interact with nucleoporins. These data indicate that transport receptors such as Pse1p interact in a Ran-dependent manner with certain nucleoporins. These nucleoporins may represent major docking sites for Pse1p as it moves in or out of the nucleus via the NPC.

insoluble	prion	The maintenance of [PSI], a prion-like form of the yeast release factor Sup35, requires a specific concentration of the chaperone protein Hsp104: either deletion or overexpression of Hsp104 will cure cells of [PSI]. A major puzzle of these studies was that overexpression of Hsp104 alone, from a heterologous promoter, cures cells of [PSI] very efficiently, yet the natural induction of Hsp104 with heat shock, stationary-phase growth, or sporulation does not. These observations pointed to a mechanism for protecting the genetic information carried by the [PSI] element from vicissitudes of the environment. Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of Ssa1, a protein of the Hsp70 family, protects [PSI] from curing by overexpression of Hsp104. Ssa1 protein belongs to the Ssa subfamily, members of which are normally induced with Hsp104 during heat shock, stationary-phase growth, and sporulation. At the molecular level, excess Ssa1 prevents a shift of Sup35 protein from the insoluble (prion) to the soluble (cellular) state in the presence of excess Hsp104. Overexpression of Ssa1 also increases nonsense suppression by [PSI] when Hsp104 is expressed at its normal level. In contrast, hsp104 deletion strains lose [PSI] even in the presence of overproduced Ssa1. Overproduction of the unrelated chaperone protein Hsp82 (Hsp90) neither cured [PSI] nor antagonized the [PSI]-curing effect of overproduced Hsp104. Our results suggest it is the interplay between Hsp104 and Hsp70 that allows the maintenance of [PSI] under natural growth conditions.
RNA polymerase II	Pol II	Yeast contains at least two complex forms of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), one including the Srbps and a second biochemically distinct form defined by the presence of Paf1p and Cdc73p (X. Shi et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 17:1160-1169, 1997). In this work we demonstrate that Ccr4p and Hpr1p are components of the Paf1p-Cdc73p-Pol II complex. We have found many synthetic genetic interactions between factors within the Paf1p-Cdc73p complex, including the lethality of paf1Delta ccr4Delta, paf1Delta hpr1Delta, ccr4Delta hpr1Delta, and ccr4Delta gal11Delta double mutants. In addition, paf1Delta and ccr4Delta are lethal in combination with srb5Delta, indicating that the factors within and between the two RNA polymerase II complexes have overlapping essential functions. We have used differential display to identify several genes whose expression is affected by mutations in components of the Paf1p-Cdc73p-Pol II complex. Additionally, as previously observed for hpr1Delta, deleting PAF1 or CDC73 leads to elevated recombination between direct repeats. The paf1Delta and ccr4Delta mutations, as well as gal11Delta, demonstrate sensitivity to cell wall-damaging agents, rescue of the temperature-sensitive phenotype by sorbitol, and reduced expression of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. This unusual combination of effects on recombination and cell wall integrity has also been observed for mutations in genes in the Pkc1p-Mpk1p kinase cascade. Consistent with a role for this novel form of RNA polymerase II in the Pkc1p-Mpk1p signaling pathway, we find that paf1Delta mpk1Delta and paf1Delta pkc1Delta double mutants do not demonstrate an enhanced phenotype relative to the single mutants. Our observation that the Mpk1p kinase is fully active in a paf1Delta strain indicates that the Paf1p-Cdc73p complex may function downstream of the Pkc1p-Mpk1p cascade to regulate the expression of a subset of yeast genes.
nuclear vitamin D receptor	VDR	The nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of a nuclear receptor superfamily and acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. A family of cotranscriptional activators (SRC-1, TIF2, and AIB-1) interacts with and activates the transactivation function of nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent way. We examined interaction of VDR with these coactivators that was induced by several vitamin D analogs, since they exert differential subsets of the biological action of vitamin D through unknown mechanisms. Unlike other vitamin D analogs tested, OCT (22-oxa-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) induced interaction of VDR with TIF2 but not with SRC-1 or AIB-1. Consistent with these interactions, only TIF2 was able to potentiate the transactivation function of VDR bound to OCT. Thus, the present findings suggest that the structure of VDR is altered in a vitamin D analog-specific way, resulting in selective interactions of VDR with coactivators. Such selective interaction of coactivators with VDR may specify the array of biological actions of a vitamin D analog like OCT, possibly through activating a particular set of target gene promoters.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	The yeast SAR1 gene encodes a low-molecular-weight GTPase which is essential for the formation of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To understand how the Sar1p function is regulated in its GTPase cycle, we searched for multicopy suppressors of sar1 temperature-sensitive mutants and identified SEC12, SED4, truncated SEC16, and EKS1. EKS1 turns out to be identical to HRD3, which was independently isolated as a gene implicated in the degradation of an HMG-CoA reductase isozyme, Hmg2p. In this paper, we show that the product of EKS1/HRD3 is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein and resides in the ER. The eks1/hrd3 disrupted cells are normal in growth and transport of cargo proteins, but missecrete BiP (Kar2p). The overexpression of EKS1/HRD3, which stabilizes Hmg2p, did not affect the stability of wild-type or mutant Sar1p or any early Sec proteins we examined. These results suggest that the role of Eks1p/Hrd3p is not involved in the ER protein degradation in general but rather required for the maintenance of the ER membrane functions. The novel genetic interactions unveiled between SAR1, SEC12, SEC16, and SED4 will provide useful information as to how the complex machinery of vesicle budding operates.
internal transcribed spacer 1	ITS1	The structure of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was examined with respect to phylogenetically conserved features in yeasts as well as the binding of transacting factors that potentially play a role in ribosomal maturation. Computer analyses and probes for nuclease protection indicate a compact, more highly organized structure than previously proposed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with distinct structural features which can be recognized in S. cerevisiae. These include a central extended hairpin structure as well as smaller hairpins immediately adjacent to the maturing termini. Comparisons with ITS sequences in more diverse organisms indicate that the same features also can be recognized. This is especially clear in organisms which contain very short sequences in which the putative structures are much less ambiguous. Again nuclease protection analyses in one of these, Verticillium albo-atrum, confirm a central hairpin with additional hairpins linked to the maturing termini. Protein binding and gel retardation studies with the S. pombe ITS1 further indicate that, as observed in the 3' external transcripted spacer (ETS) region, the extended hairpin is not only the site of intermediate RNA cleavage during rRNA processing, but also a site for specific interactions with one or more soluble factors. Taken together with other analyses on transcribed spacer regions, the present data provide evidence that the spacer regions act not only to organize the maturing terminal sequences but also may serve to organize specific soluble factors, possibly acting in a manner which is analogous with that of the free small nucleolar ribonucleo protein particles (snoRNPs).

origin recognition complex	ORC	Silencing of the cryptic mating-type loci HMR and HML requires the recognition of DNA sequence elements called silencers by the Sir1p, one of four proteins dedicated to the assembly of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Sir1p is thought to recognize silencers indirectly through interactions with proteins that bind the silencer DNA directly, such as the origin recognition complex (ORC). Eight recessive alleles of SIR1 were discovered that encode mutant Sir1 proteins specifically defective in their ability to recognize the HMR-E silencer. The eight missense mutations all map within a 17-amino-acid segment of Sir1p, and this segment was also required for Sir1p's interaction with Orc1p. The mutant Sir1 proteins could function in silencing if tethered to a silencer directly through a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Thus the amino acids identified are required for Sir1 protein's recognition of the HMR-E silencer and interaction with Orc1p, but not for its ability to function in silencing per se. The approach used to find these mutations may be applicable to defining interaction surfaces on proteins involved in other processes that require the assembly of macromolecular complexes.
p21-GTPase-activated protein kinase	PAK	Pak1 protein kinase of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a member of the p21-GTPase-activated protein kinase (PAK) family, participates in signaling pathways including sexual differentiation and morphogenesis. The regulatory domain of PAK proteins is thought to inhibit the kinase catalytic domain, as truncation of this region renders kinases more active. Here we report the detection in the two-hybrid system of the interaction between Pak1 regulatory domain and the kinase catalytic domain. Pak1 catalytic domain binds to the same highly conserved region on the regulatory domain that binds Cdc42, a GTPase protein capable of activating Pak1. Two-hybrid, mutant, and genetic analyses indicated that this intramolecular interaction rendered the kinase in a closed and inactive configuration. We show that Cdc42 can induce an open configuration of Pak1. We propose that Cdc42 interaction disrupts the intramolecular interactions of Pak1, thereby releasing the kinase from autoinhibition.
fluorescence polarization	FP	The fluorescence polarization (FP) technique was evaluated to determine molecular interaction between plant lectins and polysaccharides, yeast cells and glycopeptide after labeling the lectins with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Use of Lycoris radiata agglutinin allowed determination of the molecular interactions with large biomolecules containing mannose oligomers and polymers. Another example using a fluorescein-labeled glycopeptide also indicated that use of the FP method would allow easy observation of the molecular interactions on the quantitative base. The present technique is highly sensitive and facile because it does not require any washing procedures before measurement.
CD2 binding protein 2	CD2BP2	An intracellular protein termed CD2 binding protein 2 (CD2BP2), which binds to a site containing two PPPGHR segments within the cytoplasmic region of CD2, was identified. Mutagenesis and NMR analysis demonstrated that the CD2 binding region of CD2BP2 includes a 17-aa motif (GPY[orF]xxxxM[orV]xxWxxx GYF), also found in several yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins of unknown function. In Jurkat T cells, over-expression of the isolated CD2BP2 domain binding to CD2 enhances the production of interleukin 2 on crosslinking of CD2 but not the T cell receptor. Hence, a proline-binding module distinct from SH3 and WW domains regulates protein-protein interactions.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	The posttranslational translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in yeast requires ATP hydrolysis and the action of hsc70s (DnaK homologues) and DnaJ homologues in both the cytosol and ER lumen. Although the cytosolic hsc70 (Ssa1p) and the ER lumenal hsc70 (BiP) are homologous, they cannot substitute for one another, possibly because they interact with specific DnaJ homologues on each side of the ER membrane. To investigate this possibility, we purified Ssa1p, BiP, Ydj1p (a cytosolic DnaJ homologue), and a GST-63Jp fusion protein containing the lumenal DnaJ region of Sec63p. We observed that BiP, but not Ssa1p, is able to associate with GST-63Jp and that Ydj1p stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1p up to 10-fold but increases the ATPase activity of BiP by <2-fold. In addition, Ydj1p and ATP trigger the release of an unfolded polypeptide from Ssa1p but not from BiP. To understand further how BiP drives protein translocation, we purified four dominant lethal mutants of BiP. We discovered that each mutant is defective for ATP hydrolysis, fails to undergo an ATP-dependent conformational change, and cannot interact with GST-63Jp. Measurements of protein translocation into reconstituted proteoliposomes indicate that the mutants inhibit translocation even in the presence of wild-type BiP. We conclude that a conformation- and ATP-dependent interaction of BiP with the J domain of Sec63p is essential for protein translocation and that the specificity of hsc70 action is dictated by their DnaJ partners.
nuclear pore complex	NPC	Nup159p/Rat7p is an essential FG repeat-containing nucleoporin localized at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and involved in poly(A)+ RNA export and NPC distribution. A detailed structural-functional analysis of this nucleoporin previously demonstrated that Nup159p is anchored within the NPC through its essential carboxyl-terminal domain. In this study, we demonstrate that Nup159p specifically interacts through this domain with both Nsp1p and Nup82p. Further analysis of the interactions within the Nup159p/Nsp1p/Nup82p subcomplex using the nup82Delta108 mutant strain revealed that a deletion within the carboxyl-terminal domain of Nup82p prevents its interaction with Nsp1p but does not affect the interaction between Nup159p and Nsp1p. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that Nup159p is delocalized from the NPC in nup82Delta108 cells grown at 37 degrees C, a temperature at which the Nup82Delta108p mutant protein becomes degraded. This suggests that Nup82p may act as a docking site for a core complex composed of the repeat-containing nucleoporins Nup159p and Nsp1p. In vivo transport assays further revealed that nup82Delta108 and nup159-1/rat7-1 mutant strains have little if any defect in nuclear protein import and protein export. Together our data suggest that the poly(A)+ RNA export defect previously observed in nup82 mutant cells might be due to the loss from the NPCs of the repeat-containing nucleoporin Nup159p.
Domain 5	D5	Group II introns are ribozymes with a complex tertiary architecture that is of great interest as a model for RNA folding. Domain 5 (D5) is a highly conserved region of the intron that is considered one of the most critical structures in the catalytic core. Despite its central importance, the means by which D5 interacts with other core elements is unclear. To obtain a map of potential interaction sites, dimethyl sulfate was used to footprint regions of the intron that are involved in D5 binding. These studies were complemented by measurements of D5 binding to a series of truncated intron derivatives. In this way, the minimal region of the intron required for strong D5 association was defined and the sites most likely to represent thermodynamically significant positions of tertiary contact were identified. These studies show that ground-state D5 binding is mediated by tertiary contacts to specific regions of D1, including a tetraloop receptor and an adjacent three-way junction. In contrast, D2 and D3 are not found to stabilize D5 association. These data highlight the significance of D1-D5 interactions and will facilitate the identification of specific tertiary contacts between them.
equilibrium binding	TBP	The equilibrium binding and association kinetics of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TATA Binding Protein (TBP) to the E4 and Major Late promoters of adenovirus (TATATATA and TATAAAAG, respectively), have been directly compared by quantitative DNase I titration and quench-flow "footprinting". The equilibrium binding of TBP to both promoters is described by the equilibrium TBP + DNA"TATA" left and right arrow TBP-DNA"TATA". The salt dependence of TBP binding to both promoters is identical within experimental error while the temperature dependence differs significantly. The observed rate of association follows simple second-order kinetics over the TBP concentration ranges investigated. The salt and temperature dependencies of the second-order association rate constants for TBP binding the two promoters reflect the dependencies determined by equilibrium binding. The TBP-E4 promoter interaction is entropically driven at low temperature and enthalpically driven at high temperature while the TBP-Major Late promoter reaction is entropically driven over virtually the entire temperature range investigated. These data suggest that the reaction mechanisms of TBP-promoter interactions are TATA sequence-specific and provide for differential regulation of promoters as a function of environmental variables.
dopamine D4 receptor	GPCR	The dopamine D4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the dopamine D2-like receptor family. Functionally, the D2-like receptors are characterized by their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The dopamine D4 receptor as well as many other catecholaminergic receptors contain several putative SH3 binding domains. Most of these sites in the D4 receptor are located in a polymorphic repeat sequence and flanking sequences in the third intracellular loop. Here we demonstrate that this region of the D4 receptor can interact with a large variety of SH3 domains of different origin. The strongest interactions were seen with the SH2-SH3 adapter proteins Grb2 and Nck. The repeat sequence itself is not essential in this interaction. The data presented indicate that the different SH3 domains in the adapter proteins interact in a cooperative fashion with two distinct sites immediately upstream and downstream from the repeat sequence. Removal of all the putative SH3 binding domains in the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D4 receptor resulted in a receptor that could still bind spiperone and dopamine. Dopamine could not modulate the coupling of these mutant receptors to adenylyl cyclase and MAPK, although dopamine modulated receptor-G protein interaction appeared normal. The receptor deletion mutants show strong constitutive internalization that may account for the deficiency in functional activation of second messengers. The data indicates that the D4 receptor contains SH3 binding sites and that these sites fall within a region involved in the control of receptor internalization.

T cell receptor	TCR	Opposing cells often communicate signalling events using multivalent interactions between receptors present on their cell surface. For example, T cells are typically activated when the T cell receptor (TCR) and its associated costimulatory molecules are multivalently engaged by the appropriate ligands present on an antigen presenting cell. In this report, yeast expressing high cell-surface levels of a TCR ligand (a recombinant antibody to the TCR Vbeta domain) were shown to act as 'pseudo' antigen presenting cells and induce T cell activation as monitored by increased levels of CD25 and CD69 and by downregulation of cell surface TCR. Similar levels of T cell activation could occur even when a 30-fold excess of irrelevant yeast was present, suggesting that such a yeast display system, by virtue of its ability to present ligands multivalently, may be used in highly sensitive procedures to identify novel polypeptides that interact multivalently with cell surface receptors and thereby trigger specific cellular responses.
archaeal RNA polymerases	RNAPs	Archaeal RNA polymerases (RNAPs) resemble the eukaryotic nuclear RNAPs in complexity, and many of their subunits display a high degree of sequence similarity to their eukaryotic counterparts. Here we describe specific protein-protein contacts present between individual recombinant RNAP subunits from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii. Subunits D and L interact specifically with each other in two-hybrid assays. D also interacts under the same conditions with the RPB11 and AC19 subunits from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that essential elements of the binding surface between these proteins have been conserved across the archaeal/eukaryotic evolutionary domain boundary. Interactions between L and RPB3 or AC40 were, however, not detectable. Recombinant D and L subunits associate under in vitro conditions and copurify with each other during size-exclusion chromatography. Addition of an another recombinant subunit (N) to the D-L complex results in the formation of a triple complex. This D-L-N complex resembles the RPB3-RPB11-RPB10 or AC40-AC19-RPB10 complexes in eukaryotic RNAPIIand RNAPI/RNAPIII, respectively. Our data provide evidence for a close similarity in the quaternary arrangement of a subset of archaeal and eukaryotic RNA polymerase subunits and the conservation of the protein-protein contacts formed between them.
mRNA 5'-triphosphatase	CTD	mRNA capping is a cotranscriptional event mediated by the association of capping enzyme with the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, capping enzyme is composed of two subunits, the mRNA 5'-triphosphatase (Cet1) and the mRNA guanylyltransferase (Ceg1). Here we map interactions between Ceg1, Cet1, and the CTD. Although the guanylyltransferase subunit can bind alone to the CTD, it cannot be guanylylated unless the triphosphatase subunit is also present. Therefore, the yeast mRNA guanylyltransferase is regulated by allosteric interactions with both the triphosphatase and CTD.
nucleotide excision repair	NER	Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and DNA mismatch repair are required for some common processes although the biochemical basis for this requirement is unknown. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using MSH2 as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis. MSH2 coimmunoprecipitated specifically with epitope-tagged versions of RAD2, RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25. MSH2 and RAD10 were found to interact in msh3 msh6 and mlh1 pms1 double mutants, suggesting a direct interaction with MSH2. Mutations in MSH2 increased the UV sensitivity of NER-deficient yeast strains, and msh2 mutations were epistatic to the mutator phenotype observed in NER-deficient strains. These data suggest that MSH2 and possibly other components of DNA mismatch repair exist in a complex with NER proteins, providing a biochemical and genetical basis for these proteins to function in common processes.
cyclin-dependent kinase 2	Cdk2	Understanding the genetic networks that operate inside cells will require the dissection of interactions among network members. Here we describe a peptide aptamer isolated from a combinatorial library that distinguishes among such interactions. This aptamer binds to cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and inhibits its kinase activity. In contrast to naturally occurring inhibitors, such as p21(Cip1), which inhibit the activity of Cdk2 on all its substrates, inhibition by pep8 has distinct substrate specificity. We show that the aptamer binds to Cdk2 at or near its active site and that its mode of inhibition is competitive. Expression of pep8 in human cells retards their progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our results suggest that the aptamer inhibits cell-cycle progression by blocking the activity of Cdk2 on substrates needed for the G1-to-S transition. This work demonstrates the feasibility of selection of artificial proteins to perform functions not developed during evolution. The ability to select proteins that block interactions between a gene product and some partners but not others should make sophisticated genetic manipulations possible in human cells and other currently intractable systems.
nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles	snRNPs	Nuclear pre-mRNA splicing occurs in a large RNA-protein complex containing four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and additional protein factors. The yeast Prp4 (yPrp4) protein is a specific component of the U4/U6 and U4/U6-U5 snRNPs, which associates transiently with the spliceosome before the first step of splicing. In this work, we used the in vivo yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro immunoprecipitation assays to show that yPrp4 interacts with yPrp3, another U4/U6 snRNP protein. To investigate the domain of yPrp4 that directly contacts yPrp3, we introduced deletions in the N-terminal half of yPrp4 and point mutations in the C-terminal half of the molecule, and we tested the resulting prp4 mutants for cell viability and for their ability to interact with yPrp3. We could not define any particular sequence in the first 161 amino acid residues that are specifically required for protein-protein interactions. However, deletion of a small basic-rich region of 30 amino acid residues is lethal to the cells. Analysis of the C terminus prp4 mutants obtained clearly shows that this region of yPrp4 represents the primary domain of interaction with yPrp3. Interestingly, yPrp4 shows significant similarity in its C-terminal half to the beta-subunits of G proteins. We have generated a three-dimensional computer model of this domain, consisting of a seven-bladed beta-propeller based on the crystalline structure of beta-transducin. Several lines of evidence suggested that yPrp4 is contacting yPrp3 through a large flat surface formed by the long variable loops linking the beta-strands of the propeller. This surface could be used as a scaffold for generating an RNA-protein complex. Copyright 1998 Academic Press

GTPase-activating protein	RasGAP	A 62-kDa Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP)-associated protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated under a variety of circumstances including growth factor stimulation and in cells transformed by activated tyrosine kinases. A cDNA for p62(dok), reported to be the RasGAP-associated 62-kDa protein, was recently cloned from Abl-transformed cells. In this study, the interactions of p62(dok) with Bcr-Abl and associated proteins were examined. In 32D myeloid cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts transformed by p210(bcr-abl), p62(dok) is tyrosine-phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitates with Bcr-Abl, RasGAP, and CrkL, a Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) from cells expressing p210(bcr-abl) bound directly to the SH2 domains of Abl and CrkL in a gel overlay assay. Previous work has shown that an SH2 domain deletion mutant of Bcr-Abl is defective in transforming fibroblasts but remains capable of inducing myeloid growth factor independence. In both fibroblasts and myeloid cells expressing this mutant, p62(dok) is underphosphorylated as compared with cells expressing full-length p210(bcr-abl) but remains capable of associating with Bcr-Abl. However, in a gel overlay assay, p62(dok) from cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion was incapable of associating directly with SH2 domains of Abl and CrkL. Interestingly, no direct binding between Bcr-Abl and p62(dok) could be demonstrated in a yeast two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that indirect interactions mediate the interaction between Bcr-Abl and p62(dok) and that the SH2 domain of Bcr-Abl is required for hyperphosphorylation of p62(dok). Further, hyperphosphorylation of p62(dok) correlates with the ability of Bcr-Abl to transform fibroblasts but not with the induction of growth factor independence in myeloid cells.

yTAFII145	TAND	TFIID is a multiprotein complex composed of TBP and several TAFIIs. Small amino-terminal segments (TAF N-terminal domain (TAND)) of Drosophila TAFII230 (dTAFII230) and yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) bind strongly to TBP and inhibit TBP-DNA interactions. yTAFII145 TAND (yTAND) was divided into two subdomains, yTANDI10-37 and yTANDII46-71, that function cooperatively. Here, we identify dTANDII within the amino terminus of dTAFII230 at 118-143 amino acids in addition to dTANDI18-77, reported previously. dTANDII exhibits pronounced sequence similarity to yTANDII, and the two were shown to be functionally equivalent in binding to TBP and inhibiting TBP-DNA interactions in vitro. Alanine scanning mutation analysis demonstrated that Phe-57 (yTANDII) and Tyr-129 (dTANDII) are critically required for the interaction with TBP. Yeast strains containing mutant yTAFII145 lacking yTANDI or yTANDII showed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. The conserved core of dTANDII could substitute for the yTANDII core, and Phe-57 or Tyr-129 described above was critically required for the function of this segment in promoting normal cell growth at 37 degreesC. In these respects, the impact of yTANDII mutations on cell growth paralleled their effects on TBP binding in vitro, strongly suggesting that the yTAFII145-TBP interaction and its negative effects on TFIID binding to core promoters are physiologically important.
TAF N-terminal domain	dTAFII230	TFIID is a multiprotein complex composed of TBP and several TAFIIs. Small amino-terminal segments (TAF N-terminal domain (TAND)) of Drosophila TAFII230 (dTAFII230) and yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) bind strongly to TBP and inhibit TBP-DNA interactions. yTAFII145 TAND (yTAND) was divided into two subdomains, yTANDI10-37 and yTANDII46-71, that function cooperatively. Here, we identify dTANDII within the amino terminus of dTAFII230 at 118-143 amino acids in addition to dTANDI18-77, reported previously. dTANDII exhibits pronounced sequence similarity to yTANDII, and the two were shown to be functionally equivalent in binding to TBP and inhibiting TBP-DNA interactions in vitro. Alanine scanning mutation analysis demonstrated that Phe-57 (yTANDII) and Tyr-129 (dTANDII) are critically required for the interaction with TBP.

cyclosporin A	CsA	Cyclophilins are cis-trans-peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that bind to and are inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). The toxic effects of CsA are mediated by the 18-kDa cyclophilin A protein. A larger cyclophilin of 40 kDa, cyclophilin 40, is a component of Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes and contains two domains, an amino-terminal prolyl isomerase domain and a carboxy-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. There are two cyclophilin 40 homologs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by the CPR6 and CPR7 genes. Yeast strains lacking the Cpr7 enzyme are viable but exhibit a slow-growth phenotype. In addition, we show here that cpr7 mutant strains are hypersensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. When overexpressed, the TPR domain of Cpr7 alone complements both cpr7 mutant phenotypes, while overexpression of the cyclophilin domain of Cpr7, full-length Cpr6, or human cyclophilin 40 does not. The open reading frame YBR155w, which has moderate identity to the yeast p60 homolog STI1, was isolated as a high-copy-number suppressor of the cpr7 slow-growth phenotype. We show that this Sti1 homolog Cns1 (cyclophilin seven suppressor) is constitutively expressed, essential, and found in protein complexes with both yeast Hsp90 and Cpr7 but not with Cpr6. Cyclosporin A inhibited Cpr7 interactions with Cns1 but not with Hsp90. In summary, our findings identify a novel component of the Hsp90 chaperone complex that shares function with cyclophilin 40 and provide evidence that there are functional differences between two conserved sets of Hsp90 binding proteins in yeast.

RNA	dsRNA	The human double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase PKR inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). Vaccinia virus E3L encodes a dsRNA binding protein that inhibits PKR in virus-infected cells, presumably by sequestering dsRNA activators. Expression of PKR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, dependent on its two dsRNA binding motifs (DRBMs). We found that expression of E3 in yeast overcomes the lethal effect of PKR in a manner requiring key residues (Lys-167 and Arg-168) needed for dsRNA binding by E3 in vitro. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal half of E3, and residue Trp-66 in particular, also is required for anti-PKR function. Because the E3 N-terminal region does not contribute to dsRNA binding in vitro, it appears that sequestering dsRNA is not the sole function of E3 needed for inhibition of PKR. This conclusion was supported by the fact that E3 activity was antagonized, not augmented, by overexpressing the catalytically defective PKR-K296R protein containing functional DRBMs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that a majority of PKR in yeast extracts was in a complex with E3, whose formation was completely dependent on the dsRNA binding activity of E3 and enhanced by the N-terminal half of E3. In yeast two-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding experiments, segments of E3 and PKR containing their respective DRBMs interacted in a manner requiring E3 residues Lys-167 and Arg-168. We also detected interactions between PKR and the N-terminal half of E3 in the yeast two-hybrid and lambda repressor dimerization assays. In the latter case, the N-terminal half of E3 interacted with the kinase domain of PKR, dependent on E3 residue Trp-66. We propose that effective inhibition of PKR in yeast requires formation of an E3-PKR-dsRNA complex, in which the N-terminal half of E3 physically interacts with the protein kinase domain of PKR.

alpha-factor pheromone receptor	TMDs	The alpha-factor pheromone receptor (Ste2p) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors that contain seven transmembrane domains (TMDs). Because polar residues can influence receptor structure by forming intramolecular contacts between TMDs, we tested the role of the five polar amino acids in TMD6 of the alpha-factor receptor by mutating these residues to nonpolar leucine. Interestingly, a subset of these mutants showed increased affinity for ligand and constitutive receptor activity. The mutation of the most polar residue, Q253L, resulted in 25-fold increased affinity and a 5-fold-higher basal level of signaling that was equal to about 19% of the alpha-factor induced maximum signal. Mutation of the adjacent residue, S254L, caused weaker constitutive activity and a 5-fold increase in affinity. Comparison of nine different mutations affecting Ser254 showed that an S254F mutation caused higher constitutive activity, suggesting that a large hydrophobic amino acid residue at position 254 alters transmembrane helix packing. Thus, these studies indicate that Gln253 and Ser254 are likely to be involved in intramolecular interactions with other TMDs. Furthermore, Gln253 and Ser254 fall on one side of the transmembrane helix that is on the opposite side from residues that do not cause constitutive activity when mutated. These results suggest that Gln253 and Ser254 face inward toward the other TMDs and thus provide the first experimental evidence to suggest the orientation of a TMD in this receptor. Consistent with this, we identified two residues in TMD7 (Ser288 and Ser292) that are potential contact residues for Gln253 because mutations affecting these residues also cause constitutive activity. Altogether, these results identify a new domain of the alpha-factor receptor that regulates its ability to enter the activated conformation.
pre-ribosomal RNA	pre-rRNA	To identify new genes involved in 3'-end formation of mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we carried out a screen for synthetic lethal mutants with the conditional poly(A) polymerase allele, pap1-7. Five independent temperature-sensitive mutations called Icp1 to Icp5 (for lethal with conditional pap1 allele) were isolated. Here, we describe the characterization of the essential gene LCP5 which codes for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 40.8 kD. Unexpectedly, we found that mutations in LCP5 caused defects in pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing, whereas mRNA 3'-end formation in vitro was comparable to wild-type. Early cleavage steps (denoted A0 to A2) that lead to the production of mature 18S rRNA were impaired. In vivo depletion of Lcp5p also inhibited pre-rRNA processing. As a consequence, mutant and depleted cells showed decreased levels of polysomes compared to wild-type cells. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated a predominant localization of Lcp5p in the nucleolus. In addition, antibodies directed against Lcp5p specifically immunoprecipitated the yeast U3 snoRNA snR17, suggesting that the protein is directly involved in pre-rRNA processing.
TATA box-binding protein	TBP	A C-terminal segment of the yeast activator Gal4 manifests two functions: When tethered to DNA, it elicits gene activation, and it binds the inhibitor Gal80. Here we examine the effects on these two functions of cysteine and proline substitutions. We find that, although certain cysteine substitutions diminish interaction with Gal80, those substitutions have little effect on the activating function in vivo and interaction with TATA box-binding protein (TBP) in vitro. Proline substitutions introduced near residues critical for Gal80 binding abolish that interaction but once again have no effect on the activating function. Crosslinking experiments show that a defined position in the activating peptide is in close proximity to TBP and Gal80 in the two separate reactions and show that binding of the inhibitor blocks binding to TBP. Thus, the same stretch of amino acids are involved in two quite different protein-protein interactions: binding to Gal80, which depends on a precise sequence and the formation of a defined secondary structure, or interactions with the transcriptional machinery in vivo, which are not impaired by perturbations of either sequence or structure.
dehydroepiandrosterone	DHEA	Studies of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with the human estrogen receptor in yeast.
dehydroepiandrosterone	DHEA	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a C19 adrenal steroid synthesized in the human adrenal cortex and serving as a biosynthetic precursor to testosterone and 17beta-estradiol. Despite the fact that it is one of the most abundant steroid hormones in circulation, the physiological role of DHEA in humans remains unclear. The action of DHEA itself, such as its interactions with receptors and nuclear transcription factors, is not well understood, and a specific DHEA receptor has yet to be identified. Although the activity of DHEA can be due to its metabolism into androgens and estrogens, DHEA has been shown to interact with the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor (ER) in vitro. We demonstrate in this study that DHEA (3beta-Hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-17-one) inhibits 17beta-estradiol (E2) binding to its receptor in vivo in yeast. DHEA stimulates human ER dimerization in yeast, as determined by ER fusion protein interactions, GAL4 reconstitution and subsequent measurement of increased beta-galactosidase activity. DHEA causes an increase in estrogen response element-dependent beta-galactosidase activity, demonstrating that the ER dimer induced by DHEA is transcriptionally active, but at a concentration of DHEA about 1000 times greater than E2. Inclusion of the nuclear receptor co-activator RIP140 in the yeast enhances ER transactivation by DHEA or E2 in a ligand-dependent manner; moreover, only in the presence of RIP140 is DHEA able to stimulate beta-galactosidase activity to levels similar to those achieved by E2. Ligand-receptor interaction for other C19-steroids was also examined. While 5-androstene-3beta, 17beta-diol (ADIOL) displayed estrogenic activity in this system, 4-androstene-17-dione (androstenedione) and 4-androstene-17beta-ol,3-one (testosterone) did not. We have investigated whether DHEA can interact with the human ER in vivo. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism by which DHEA interacts directly with estrogen signaling systems; however, because DHEA is several orders of magnitude less potent than E2 in this system, we conclude that it essentially is not an estrogen agonist.

phosphoinositide 3-kinase	PI 3-kinase	A number of reports suggest that under different conditions leading to cytoskeleton reorganization the GTPase Rac1 and possibly RhoA are downstream targets of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In order to gain more insight into this particular signaling pathway, we have addressed the question of a possible direct interaction of PI 3-kinase products with the Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Using recombinant proteins, we found that Rac1 and, to a lesser extent, RhoA but not Cdc42 were capable to selectively bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in a mixture of crude brain phosphoinositides. Nucleotide-depleted Rac1 was the most efficient, but the GDP- and GTP-bound forms retained significant PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding activity. This protein-lipid association involved electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions, since both phosphate groups located at specific positions of the inositol ring and fatty-acyl chains were absolutely required. Based on the sequence of Rac1, two potential binding sites were identified, one at the C terminus and one in the extra alpha-helical domain. Deletion of these two domains resulted in a complete loss of binding to PI 3-kinase products. Finally, PtdIns(3, 4,5)P3 strongly stimulated GDP dissociation from Rac1 in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement, data obtained in intact cells suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 might target Rac1 to peculiar membrane domains, allowing formation of specific clusters containing not only small GTPases but other partners bearing pleckstrin homology domains such as specific exchange factors required for Rac1 and RhoA activation.
ATMPK4	MAPK	A possible MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade of Arabidopsis thaliana was identified on the basis of both yeast 2-hybrid analysis and complementation analysis of yeast mutants. Specific protein-protein interactions between ATMPK4 (a MAPK) and MEK1 (a MAPKK) and interactions between MEK1 and ATMEKK1 (a MAPKKK) were detected by using the 2-hybrid system. A growth defect of the yeast mpk1delta mutant was reversed by coexpression of ATMPK4 and MEK1. Coexpression of the N-terminal deletion form of ATMEKK1 increased the ability of MEK1 to suppress a growth defect of the yeast pbs2delta mutant. These results suggest that ATMPK4, MEK1, and ATMEKK1 may interact with each other and constitute a specific MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. This is the first demonstration of a possible MAPK cascade in plants.
heat-shock protein 90	Hsp90	The heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a cytosolic molecular chaperone that is highly abundant even at normal temperature. Specific functions for Hsp90 have been proposed based on the characterization of its interactions with certain transcription factors and kinases including Raf in vertebrates and flies. We therefore decided to address the role of Hsp90 for MAP kinase pathways in the budding yeast, an organism amenable to both genetic and biochemical analyses. We found that both basal and induced activities of the pheromone-signaling pathway depend on Hsp90. Signaling is defective in strains expressing low levels or point mutants of yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82), or human Hsp90beta instead of the wild-type protein. Ste11, a yeast equivalent of Raf, forms complexes with wild-type Hsp90 and depends on Hsp90 function for accumulation. For budding yeast, Ste11 represents the first identified endogenous "substrate" of Hsp90. Moreover, Hsp90 functions in steroid receptor and pheromone signaling can be genetically separated as the Hsp82 point mutant T525I and the human Hsp90beta are specifically defective for the former and the latter, respectively. These findings further corroborate the view that molecular chaperones must also be considered as transient or stable components of signal transduction pathways.
vestigial	vg	The two genes vestigial (vg) and scalloped (sd) are required for wing development in Drosophila melanogaster. They present similar patterns of expression in second and third instar wing discs and similar wing mutant phenotypes. vg encodes a nuclear protein without any recognized nucleic acid-binding motif. Sd is a transcription factor homologous to the human TEF-1 factor whose promoter activity depends on cell-specific cofactors. We postulate that Vg could be a cofactor of Sd in the wing morphogenetic process and that, together, they could constitute a functional transcription complex. We investigated genetic interactions between the two genes. We show here that vg and sd co-operate in vivo in a manner dependent on the structure of the Vg protein. We ectopically expressed vg in the patch (ptc) domains. We show evidence that wing-like outgrowths induced by ectopic expression of vg are severely reduced in vg or sd mutant backgrounds. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ptc-GAL4-driven expression of vg induces both expressions of the endogenous vg and sd genes and that the two Vg and Sd proteins have to be produced together to promote wing proliferation. Furthermore, we show an interaction between the two proteins by double hybrid experiments in yeast. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that Sd and Vg directly interact in vivo to form a complex regulating the proliferation of wing tissue.

multiprotein complex capable of ATP-dependent remodeling of the structure of chromatin	RSC	The essential Sth1p is the protein most closely related to the conserved Snf2p/Swi2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sth1p purified from yeast has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity required for its function in vivo. The finding that Sth1p is a component of a multiprotein complex capable of ATP-dependent remodeling of the structure of chromatin (RSC) in vitro, suggests that it provides RSC with ATP hydrolysis activity. Three sth1 temperature-sensitive mutations map to the highly conserved ATPase/helicase domain and have cell cycle and non-cell cycle phenotypes, suggesting multiple essential roles for Sth1p. The Sth1p bromodomain is required for wild-type function; deletion mutants lacking portions of this region are thermosensitive and arrest with highly elongated buds and 2C DNA content, indicating perturbation of a unique function. The pleiotropic growth defects of sth1-ts mutants imply a requirement for Sth1p in a general cellular process that affects several metabolic pathways. Significantly, an sth1-ts allele is synthetically sick or lethal with previously identified mutations in histones and chromatin assembly genes that suppress snf/swi, suggesting that RSC interacts differently with chromatin than Snf/Swi. These results provide a framework for understanding the ATP-dependent RSC function in modeling chromatin and its connection to the cell cycle.
conserved dsRNA binding domain	DRBD	The vaccinia virus E3L gene product, pE3, is a dsRNA binding protein that prevents activation of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR. Activation of PKR, which results in phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2alpha, leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis, a process involved in defense against virus infection. The E3L gene product has a conserved dsRNA binding domain (DRBD) in its carboxyl-terminal region and has been shown to function in vitro by sequestration of dsRNA. We have utilized in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate direct interactions of pE3 with PKR. By these methods, we demonstrate that pE3 interacts with two distinct regions in PKR, the amino-terminal (amino acids 1-99) located in the regulatory domain and the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 367-523) located in the catalytic domain. The amino-terminal region of PKR that interacts with pE3 contains a conserved DRBD, suggesting that PKR can form nonfunctional heterodimers with pE3, analogous to those seen with other dsRNA binding proteins. Interaction of pE3 with the amino-terminal region of PKR is enhanced by dsRNA. In contrast, dsRNA reduces the interaction of pE3 with the carboxyl-terminal region of PKR. Competition experiments demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal region of PKR, to which pE3 binds, overlaps the region with which eIF2alpha and the pseudosubstrate pK3 interact, suggesting that pE3 may also prevent PKR activation by masking the substrate binding domain. Like pE3, the amino-terminal region of PKR also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal domain of PKR. These interactions increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which pE3 downregulates PKR. In addition, the PKR-PKR interactions observed leads us to suggest a novel autoregulatory mechanism for activation of PKR in which dsRNA binding to the DRBD(s) induces a conformational change that results in release of the amino terminal region from the substrate binding domain, allowing access to eIF2alpha and its subsequent phosphorylation.

Syp and Phosphatidyl-inositol-3-	PI3K	Several mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB-3 have been postulated to render this enzyme catalytically inactive. To test which amino acid mutations in ErbB-3 might be critical for kinase inactivation, we used a yeast two hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction. We monitored restoration of ErbB-3 kinase activity by investigating the ability of wild type or mutant ErbB-3 to associate with the SH2 containing proteins Syp and Phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Our results demonstrate that changing individual amino acids to tyrosine kinase consensus sequences did not increase the interaction of ErbB-3 with Syp or PI3K. Mutation of the consensus Asp832 of rat ErbB-3 to Asn observed in human and bovine ErbB-3 significantly increased the interaction of ErbB-3 and Syp and PI3K 11 or 26 fold respectively. A double mutant (Asp832Asn, Asp757 His) exhibited a 96 or 350 fold increase in the ability to bind PI3K and Syp. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.
cyclin-dependent protein kinases	CDKs	Complete activation of most cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) requires phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the major CAK is a 44-kDa protein kinase known as Cak1. Cak1 is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Cdc28, a major CDK involved in cell cycle control. We addressed the possibility that Cak1 is also required for the activation of other yeast CDKs, such as Kin28, Pho85, and Srb10. We generated three new temperature-sensitive cak1 mutant strains, which arrested at the restrictive temperature with nonuniform budding morphology. All three cak1 mutants displayed significant synthetic interactions with loss-of-function mutations in CDC28 and KIN28. Loss of Cak1 function reduced the phosphorylation and activity of both Cdc28 and Kin28 but did not affect the activity of Pho85 or Srb10. In the presence of the Kin28 regulatory subunits Ccl1 and Tfb3, Kin28 was phosphorylated and activated when coexpressed with Cak1 in insect cells. We conclude that Cak1 is required for the activating phosphorylation of Kin28 as well as that of Cdc28.

formin homology	FH	Proteins containing the formin homology (FH) domains FH1 and FH2 are involved in cytokinesis or establishment of cell polarity in a variety of organisms. We have shown that the FH proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p are potential targets of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein, profilin, at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found here that a novel Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein, encoded by YMR032w, interacted with Bnr1p in a GTP-Rho4p-dependent manner through the FH1 domain of Bnr1p and the SH3 domain of Ymr032wp. Ymr032wp weakly bound to Bni1p. Ymr032wp was homologous to cdc15p, which is involved in cytokinesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and we named this gene HOF1 (homolog of cdc 15). Both Bnr1p and Hof1p were localized at the bud neck, and both the bnr1 and hof1 mutations showed synthetic lethal interactions with the bni1 mutation. The hof1 mutant cells showed phenotypes similar to those of the septin mutants, indicating that HOF1 is involved in cytokinesis. These results indicate that Bnr1p directly interacts with Hof1p as well as with profilin to regulate cytoskeletal functions in S. cerevisiae.

mammalian small heat-shock proteins	sHsps	alphaB-Crystallin is one of the six known mammalian small heat-shock proteins (sHsps). These are characterized by the presence of a conserved sequence of 80-100 residues, which constitutes the putative C-terminal domain. Like other sHsps, alphaB-crystallin forms multimeric globular complexes, often in combination with related sHsps. Here we show that in a yeast two-hybrid system, alphaB-crystallin can specifically interact with itself as well as with alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27. Analyses of the separate domains show that the conserved C-terminal domain (CalphaB) is essential for this interaction between subunits. To try and detect residues that are important in subunit interaction, the CalphaB domain was used in a two-hybrid screen as bait to select randomly mutated CalphaB mutants. In this way we obtained nine mutants that were still able to interact with wild-type CalphaB despite the presence of up to 15 replacements. Similarly, we obtained 16 mutants that were unable to bind, because of the presence of just three to nine replacements. In binding CalphaB mutants, lysine residues were most often replaced by glutamic acid residues, and in non-binding CalphaB mutants, acidic residues were often found to be replaced by non-charged residues. This indicates that negative charges are important for subunit interaction and we propose a model to explain this role of acidic residues. Furthermore, we observed that two homologs of alphaB-crystallin, alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27, generally interact similarly with the binding and non-binding CalphaB mutants as does alphaB-crystallin. This suggests that interactions involved in the complex formation of these three sHsps are largely comparable.
serine-arginine	SR	The gene encoding the human TLS protein, also termed FUS, is located at the site of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias and sarcomas where it forms a chimeric fusion gene with one of several different genes. To identify interacting partners of TLS, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library constructed from mouse hematopoietic cells using the C-terminal region of TLS in the bait plasmid. Two cDNAs encoding members of the serine-arginine (SR) family of proteins were isolated. The first SR protein is the mouse homolog of human splicing factor SC35, and the second SR member is a novel 183-amino acid protein that we term TASR (TLS-associated serine-arginine protein). cDNA cloning of human TASR indicated that mouse and human TASR have identical amino acid sequences. The interactions between TLS and these two SR proteins were confirmed by co-transfection and immunoprecipitation studies. In vivo splicing assays indicated that SC35 and TASR influence splice site selection of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA. TLS may recruit SR splicing factors to specific target genes through interaction with its C-terminal region, and chromosomal translocations that truncate the C-terminal region of TLS may prevent this interaction. Thus TLS translocations may alter RNA processing and play a role in malignant transformation.

Tf1 integrase	IN	The yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays were used to characterize 54 potential interactions between the proteins of Tf1, an LTR-retrotransposon found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The Tf1 integrase (IN) protein was found to interact strongly with itself and not with other control proteins. In addition, the IN core domain interacted strongly with itself and full-length IN. Interestingly, the two-hybrid analysis detected an interaction between the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase and IN. The biological implications of these interactions are discussed.
brome mosaic virus	BMV	Previously, we have observed that mutations in proteins 1a and 2a, the two virally encoded components of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicase, can affect the frequency of recombination and the locations of RNA recombination sites (P. D. Nagy, A. Dzianott, P. Ahlquist, and J. J. Bujarski, J. Virol. 69:2547-2556, 1995; M. Figlerowicz, P. D. Nagy, and J. J. Bujarski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:2073-2078, 1997). Also, it was found before that the N-terminal domain of 2a, the putative RNA polymerase protein, participates in the interactions between 1a and 2a (C. C. Kao, R. Quadt, R. P. Hershberger, and P. Ahlquist, J. Virol. 66:6322-6329, 1992; E. O'Reilly, J. Paul, and C. C. Kao, J. Virol. 71:7526-7532, 1997). In this work, we examine how mutations within the N terminus of 2a influence RNA recombination in BMV. Because of the likely electrostatic character of 1a-2a interactions, five 2a mutants, MF1 to MF5, were generated by replacing clusters of acidic amino acids with their neutral counterparts. MF2 and MF5 retained nearly wild-type levels of 1a-2a interaction and were infectious in Chenopodium quinoa. However, compared to that in wild-type virus, the frequency of nonhomologous recombination in both MF2 and MF5 was markedly decreased. Only in MF2 was the frequency of homologous recombination reduced and the occurrence of imprecise homologous recombination increased. In MF5 there was also a 3' shift in the positions of homologous crossovers. The observed effects of MF2 and MF5 reveal that the 2a N-terminal domain participates in different ways in homologous and in nonhomologous BMV RNA recombination. This work maps specific locations within the N terminus involved in 1a-2a interaction and in recombination and further suggests that the mechanisms of the two types of crossovers in BMV are different.
anaphase-promoting complex	APC	Exit from mitosis requires the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin complexes, primarily by ubiquitin-dependent cyclin proteolysis. Cyclin destruction is regulated by a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, members of a large class of late mitotic mutants, including cdc15, cdc5, cdc14, dbf2, and tem1, arrest in anaphase with a phenotype similar to that of cells expressing nondegradable forms of mitotic cyclins. We addressed the possibility that the products of these genes are components of a regulatory network that governs cyclin proteolysis. We identified a complex array of genetic interactions among these mutants and found that the growth defect in most of the mutants is suppressed by overexpression of SPO12, YAK1, and SIC1 and is exacerbated by overproduction of the mitotic cyclin Clb2. When arrested in late mitosis, the mutants exhibit a defect in cyclin-specific APC activity that is accompanied by high Clb2 levels and low levels of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1. Mutant cells arrested in G1 contain normal APC activity. We conclude that Cdc15, Cdc5, Cdc14, Dbf2, and Tem1 cooperate in the activation of the APC in late mitosis but are not required for maintenance of that activity in G1.
cyclin-dependent kinases	cdks	The impact of p13suc1 on the conformation and regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins was investigated by spectroscopic and rapid kinetic approaches. In the absence of phosphorylation on cdks, p13suc1 formed stable complexes, mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, specifically with cdk2 and cdc2. The presence of cyclin A, associated with cdk2 or cdc2, increased the stability of the interaction between cdk2 and p13suc1 by a factor of 2. However, cyclin A did not modify the association rate of p13suc1 to cdk2, but the dissociation rate, which was decreased 3-fold. Moreover, binding of p13suc1 to cdk2 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the release of nucleotide from cdk2, indicating that p13suc1 induces a marked change in the structure of the nucleotide binding site of cdks. On the basis of the structure of cdk2/CksHs1 complex and on our kinetic results, we propose that the binding of Cks proteins to C-lobe of cdk2 is stabilized by the presence of cyclin A and that it may modify the orientation of the loop carrying residues 14 and 15 and their consequent access for dephosphorylation by cdc25 phosphatases. Finally, we have shown that dimerization of p13suc1 in the presence of zinc abolishes its interaction with cdks, which suggests that the binding of p13suc1 to cdk2 or cdk2/cyclin A may be regulated by dimerization of p13suc1 in vivo.
interaction of myocyte enhancer factor 2	MEF2	Interaction of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) with a mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK5/BMK1.
myocyte enhancer factor 2	MEF2	Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) has been implicated in the complex hierarchical regulation of muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation. While the MyoD family members are able to initiate the skeletal muscle differentiation program, whether MEF2 is sufficient in directing skeletal muscle differentiation is still controversial. Furthermore, how MEF2 transactivates its target genes is not fully understood. It has been suggested that the interactions of MEF2 with other factors modify its transcriptional activity. Therefore, the identification of MEF2-interacting factors may be important in understanding the mechanism by which MEF2 activates its target genes. In this study, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), ERK5/BMK1 was found to interact with MEF2 in a yeast two hybrid screen. The interaction was confirmed by a glutathione S -transferase-pull down assay and a co-immunoprecipitation study indicating that endogenous ERK5 and MEF2 interact with each other in vivo . The interacting domain of MEF2 was mapped to the N-terminus which contains the highly conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Functionally, ERK5/BMK1 was able to phosphorylate MEF2 in vitro . Furthermore, when cotransfected with ERK5/BMK1, the transactivation capacity of MEF2 was enhanced. These results suggest that the functions of MEF2 could be regulated through ERK5/BMK1.

mammalian AML/CBFalpha runt domain	RD	The mammalian AML/CBFalpha runt domain (RD) transcription factors regulate hematopoiesis and osteoblast differentiation. Like their Drosophila counterparts, most mammalian RD proteins terminate in a common pentapeptide, VWRPY, which serves to recruit the corepressor Groucho (Gro). Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro association and pull-down experiments, we demonstrate that Gro and its mammalian homolog TLE1 specifically interact with AML1 and AML2. In addition to the VWRPY motif, other C-terminal sequences are required for these interactions with Gro/TLE1. TLE1 inhibits AML1-dependent transactivation of the T cell receptor (TCR) enhancers alpha and beta, which contain functional AML binding sites, in transfected Jurkat T cells. LEF-1 is an additional transcription factor that mediates transactivation of TCR enhancers. LEF-1 and its Drosophila homolog Pangolin (Pan) are involved in the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway through interactions with the coactivator beta-catenin and its highly conserved fly homolog Armadillo (Arm). We show that TLE/Gro interacts with LEF-1 and Pan, and inhibits LEF-1:beta-catenin-dependent transcription. These data indicate that, in addition to their activity as transcriptional activators, AML1 and LEF-1 can act, through recruitment of the corepressor TLE1, as transcriptional repressors in TCR regulation and Wnt/Wg signaling.

Reb1 protein	Reb1p	Positive and negative regulation of the GAL1 promoter of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from a network of interactions between transcription factors and chromatin. In this study we used footprinting procedures to characterize these interactions in vivo. DNase I analysis of the GAL1 upstream activating sequence (UAS(GAL1/10)) showed expected Gal4 activator protein binding during growth in galactose, and also revealed binding of the Reb1 protein (Reb1p) during growth in glucose. In addition, we mapped to nucleotide resolution a positioned nucleosome that, in the inactive promoter, packages DNA between the UAS(GAL1/10) and the GAL1 TATA sequence, leaving both of these elements nucleosome free. The nucleosome footprint was lost when the promoter was activated. Surprisingly, mutation of the Reb1p binding site had no effect on nucleosome positioning or on the kinetics or extent of activation or repression of either the GAL1 or GAL10 promoters under any of the conditions assayed.
WASp-interacting protein	WIP	Several end mutations that block the internalisation step of endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect the cortical actin cytoskeleton [1]. END5 encodes a proline-rich protein (End5p or verprolin) required for a polarised cortical actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis [2,3]. End5p interacts with actin [4], but its exact function is not yet known. To help elucidate End5p function, we sought other End5p-interacting proteins and identified the LAS17/BEE1 gene (encoding the yeast homologue of the human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, WASp) as a high-copy-number suppressor of the temperature-sensitive growth and endocytic defects of end5-1 cells (carrying a frameshift mutation affecting the last 213 residues of End5p). LAS17 is unable to suppress a full deletion of END5 (end5 delta), however, suggesting that the defective End5-1p in end5-1 mutants may be stabilised by Las17p. The amino terminus of Las17p interacts with the carboxyl terminus of End5p in the yeast two-hybrid system and similar interactions have been shown between WASp and a mammalian End5p homologue, WASp-interacting protein (WIP) [5]. As las17 delta deletion mutants are blocked in endocytosis, we conclude that Las17p and End5p interact and are essential for endocytosis.
ribosomal DNA	rDNA	Silent information regulator 3 is an essential component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae silencing complex that functions at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci, HMR and HML. We show that expression of the N- and C-terminal-encoding halves of SIR3 in trans partially complements the mating defect of the sir3 null allele, suggesting that the two domains have distinct functions. We present here a functional characterization of these domains. The N-terminal domain (Sir3N) increases both the frequency and extent of telomere-proximal silencing when expressed ectopically in SIR+ yeast strains, although we are unable to detect interaction between this domain and any known components of the silencing machinery. In contrast to its effect at telomeres, Sir3N overexpression derepresses transcription of reporter genes inserted in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array. Immunolocalization of Sir3N-GFP and Sir2p suggests that Sir3N directly antagonizes nucleolar Sir2p, releasing an rDNA-bound population of Sir2p so that it can enhance repression at telomeres. Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of either Sir3p or Sir4p has a dominant-negative effect on telomeric silencing. In strains overexpressing the C-terminal domain of Sir4p, elevated expression of either full-length Sir3p or Sir3N restores repression and the punctate pattern of Sir3p and Rap1p immunostaining. The similarity of Sir3N and Sir3p overexpression phenotypes suggests that Sir3N acts as an allosteric effector of Sir3p, either enhancing its interactions with other silencing components or liberating the full-length protein from nonfunctional complexes.
polyadenylation factor I	PAP	The interaction of the Fip1 subunit of polyadenylation factor I with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A) polymerase (PAP) was assayed in vivo by two-hybrid analysis and was found to involve two separate regions on PAP, located at opposite ends of the protein sequence. In vitro, Fip1 blocks access of the RNA primer to an RNA binding site (RBS) that overlaps the Fip1 carboxy-terminal interaction region and, in doing so, shifts PAP to a distributive mode of action. Partial truncation of this RBS has the same effect, indicating that this site is required for processivity. A comparison of the utilization of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates indicates the existence on PAP of a second RBS which recognizes the last three nucleotides at the 3' end of the primer. This site discriminates against deoxyribonucleotides at the 3' end, and interactions at this site are not affected by Fip1. Further analysis revealed that the specificity of PAP for adenosine is not simply a function of the ATP binding site but also reflects interactions with bases at the 3' end of the primer and at another contact site 14 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end. These results suggest that the unique specificity of PAP for ribose and base, and thus the extent and type of activity with different substrates, depends on interactions at multiple nucleotide binding sites.

In vitro, Fip1 blocks access of the RNA primer to an RNA binding site (RBS) that overlaps the Fip1 carboxy-terminal interaction region and, in doing so, shifts PAP to a distributive mode of action. Partial truncation of this RBS has the same effect, indicating that this site is required for processivity. A comparison of the utilization of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates indicates the existence on PAP of a second RBS which recognizes the last three nucleotides at the 3' end of the primer. This site discriminates against deoxyribonucleotides at the 3' end, and interactions at this site are not affected by Fip1. Further analysis revealed that the specificity of PAP for adenosine is not simply a function of the ATP binding site but also reflects interactions with bases at the 3' end of the primer and at another contact site 14 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end. These results suggest that the unique specificity of PAP for ribose and base, and thus the extent and type of activity with different substrates, depends on interactions at multiple nucleotide binding sites.
arginyl-tRNA synthetase	ArgRS	The crystal structure of arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), with L-arginine bound to the active site has been solved at 2.75 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 19.7%. ArgRS is composed predominantly of alpha-helices and can be divided into five domains, including the class I-specific active site. The N-terminal domain shows striking similarity to some completely unrelated proteins and defines a module which should participate in specific tRNA recognition. The C-terminal domain, which is the putative anticodon-binding module, displays an all-alpha-helix fold highly similar to that of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. While ArgRS requires tRNAArg for the first step of the aminoacylation reaction, the results show that its presence is not a prerequisite for L-arginine binding. All H-bond-forming capability of L-arginine is used by the protein for the specific recognition. The guanidinium group forms two salt bridge interactions with two acidic residues, and one H-bond with a tyrosine residue; these three residues are strictly conserved in all ArgRS sequences. This tyrosine is also conserved in other class I aaRS active sites but plays several functional roles. The ArgRS structure allows the definition of a new framework for sequence alignments and subclass definition in class I aaRSs.

interferon	IFN	The interferon-induced protein kinase, PKR, is a pivotal component of interferon (IFN)-induced cellular antiviral and antiproliferative response. The identification and characterization of proteins, of both viral and cellular origins, that interact with PKR have proven to be a valuable probe for unraveling the cellular regulation and function of PKR. Several studies have demonstrated that PKR forms dimers and that dimerization is likely to be required for activation and/or catalytic function. It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanism of PKR dimer formation and the role of PKR effectors in modulating kinase dimerization. Herein we describe the use of the two genetic approaches, the lambda repressor fusion and the yeast two-hybrid systems, to detect and analyze homo- and heterotypic interactions with PKR. We also describe several biochemical methodologies commonly used in our laboratory to validate the genetic results. Although the examples in this article focus on PKR, the techniques can easily be adapted to investigate protein-protein associations in a variety of experimental systems. Finally, given the important role of PKR as a mediator of IFN-induced antiviral and antiproliferative effects, these studies may provide clues to the development of reagents that target PKR to enhance the therapeutic use of IFN in the treatment of disease.

DNA polymerase delta	pol delta	BACKGROUND: PCNA, an eukaryotic DNA sliding clamp interacts with replication factors and the cell cycle protein, p21(Cip1/Waf1) and functions as a molecular switch for DNA elongation. To understand how DNA replication is regulated through PCNA, elucidation of the precise mechanisms of these protein interactions is necessary. RESULTS: Loop-region mutants in which human PCNA sequences were substituted with the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA regions were prepared. Analysis of their functions, along with previously prepared alanine scanning mutants, demonstrated that some loops interact with DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and replication factor C (RFC). The p21 binding sites of PCNA, mapped by affinity measurement of the mutant forms, found to be located within a distinct structure of the PCNA monomer, overlap with RFC- and pol delta-interaction sites. Competition between p21 and pol delta or RFC for binding to PCNA results in efficient inhibition of its stimulation of pol delta DNA synthesis and RFC ATPase but not of PCNA loading on DNA by RFC. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-saturated amounts of p21 selectively block formation of the active pol delta complex but not the RFC-PCNA complex at 3'-ends of DNA primers. This differential effect may explain the specific inhibition of DNA replication by p21.

Schizosaccharomyces pombe	Sp	BACKGROUND: TBP-associated factors contain a variety of structural motifs and their related in vivo significance has remained unclear. We have attempted to identify specific biological phenomena linked to a particular domain of a TAF by analysing domain-exchanged chimeric mutants between Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) counterparts. RESULTS: Contrary to the case of TBP, Sp TAF containing the WD40 repeat cannot be exchanged for its Sc counterpart, despite their highly conserved primary structures. This 'species-specific' function locates in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal region, largely consisting of the WD40 repeat, is exchangeable for the corresponding region of its Sc counterpart. Growth of the strain harbouring this C-terminal chimeric mutant is temperature-sensitive. The chimeric gene product did not disappear at a restrictive temperature, a finding which strongly suggests that the growth defect is caused by an aberration in the interactions through the WD40 repeat structural motif. With temperature elevation, the chimeric mutants underwent drastic morphological changes due to a defect in cytokinesis. CONCLUSIONS: The WD40 repeat of TAF is primarily involved in reactions which might regulate cytokinesis in Sp.

tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1	HTLV-1	The Tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been implicated in human T-cell immortalization. The primary function of Tax is to transcriptionally activate the HTLV-1 promoter, but Tax is also known to stimulate expression of cellular genes. It has been reported to associate with several transcription factors, as well as proteins not involved in transcription. To better characterize potential cellular targets of Tax present in infected cells, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening was performed with a cDNA library constructed from the HTLV-1-infected MT2 cell line. From this study, we found 158 positive clones representing seven different cDNAs. We focused our attention on the cDNA encoding the transcription factor CREB-2. CREB-2 is an unconventional member of the ATF/CREB family in that it lacks a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site and has been reported to negatively regulate transcription from the cyclic AMP response element of the human enkephalin promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that CREB-2 cooperates with Tax to enhance viral transcription and that its basic-leucine zipper C-terminal domain is required for both in vitro and in vivo interactions with Tax. Our results confirm that the activation of the HTLV-1 promoter through Tax and factors of the ATF/CREB family is PKA independent.

Sterol Delta8-Delta7 isomerases	SIs	Sterol Delta8-Delta7 isomerases (SIs) catalyze the shift of the double bond from C8-9 to C7-8 in the B-ring of sterols. Surprisingly, the isoenzymes in fungi (ERG2p) and vertebrates [emopamil binding protein (EBP)] are structurally completely unrelated, whereas the sigma1 receptor, a mammalian protein of unknown function, bears significant similarity with the yeast ERG2p. Here, we compare the drug binding properties of SIs and related proteins with [3H]ifenprodil as a common high affinity radioligand (Kd = 1.4-19 nM), demonstrating an intimate pharmacological relationship among ERG2p, sigma1 receptor, and EBP. This renders SIs a remarkable example for structurally diverse enzymes with similar pharmacological profiles and the propensity to bind drugs from different chemical groups with high affinity. We identified a variety of experimental drugs with nanomolar affinity for the human EBP (Ki = 0.5-14 nM) such as MDL28815, AY9944, triparanol, and U18666A. These compounds, as well as the fungicide tridemorph and the clinically used drugs tamoxifen, clomiphene, amiodarone, and opipramol, inhibit the in vitro activity of the recombinant human EBP (IC50 = 0.015-54 microM). The high affinity of the human EBP for 3H-tamoxifen (Kd = 3 +/- 2 nM) implies that the EBP carries the previously described microsomal antiestrogen binding site. Interactions of the EBP with structurally diverse lipophilic amines suggest that novel compounds of related structure should be counterscreened for inhibition of the enzyme to avoid interference with sterol Delta8-Delta7 isomerization.

replication protein A	RPA	Replication protein A (RPA) is a multisubunit single-stranded DNA-binding (ssDNA) protein that is required for cellular DNA metabolism. RPA homologues have been identified in all eukaryotes examined. All homologues are heterotrimeric complexes with subunits of approximately 70, approximately 32, and approximately 14 kDa. While RPA homologues are evolutionarily conserved, they are not functionally equivalent. To gain a better understanding of the functional differences between RPA homologues, we analyzed the DNA-binding parameters of RPA from human cells and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (hRPA and scRPA, respectively). Both yeast and human RPA bind ssDNA with high affinity and low cooperativity. However, scRPA has a larger occluded binding site (45 nucleotides versus 34 nucleotides) and a higher affinity for oligothymidine than hRPA. Mutant forms of hRPA and scRPA containing the high-affinity DNA-binding domain from the 70-kDa subunit had nearly identical DNA binding properties. In contrast, subcomplexes of the 32- and 14-kDa subunits from both yeast and human RPA had weak ssDNA binding activity. However, the binding constants for the yeast and human subcomplexes were 3 and greater than 6 orders of magnitude lower than those for the RPA heterotrimer, respectively. We conclude that differences in the activity of the 32- and 14-kDa subunits of RPA are responsible for variations in the ssDNA-binding properties of scRPA and hRPA. These data also indicate that hRPA and scRPA have different modes of binding to ssDNA, which may contribute to the functional disparities between the two proteins.

multiprotein SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferas	SAGA	In yeast, SPT3 is a component of the multiprotein SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex that integrates proteins with transcription coactivator/adaptor functions (ADAs and GCN5), histone acetyltransferase activity (GCN5), and core promoter-selective functions (SPTs) involving interactions with the TATA-binding protein (TBP). In particular, yeast SPT3 has been shown to interact directly with TBP. Here we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human homologue of yeast SPT3. Amino acid sequence comparisons between human SPT3 (hSPT3) and its counterparts in different yeast species reveal three highly conserved domains, with the most conserved 92-amino acid N-terminal domain being 25% identical with human TAFII18. Despite the significant sequence similarity with TAFII18, native hSPT3 is not a bona fide TAFII because it is not associated in vivo either with human TBP/TFIID or with a TFIID-related TBP-free TAFII complex. However, we present evidence that hSPT3 is associated in vivo with TAFII31 and the recently described longer form of human GCN5 (hGCN5-L) in a novel human complex that has histone acetyltransferase activity. We propose that the human SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5-L acetyltransferase (STAGA) complex is a likely homologue of the yeast SAGA complex.

muscle creatine kinase	MCK	Previous investigations have demonstrated synergistic interactions in vivo between CCAC and A/T-rich nucleotide sequence motifs as functional components of muscle-specific transcriptional enhancers. Using CCAC and A/T-rich elements from the myoglobin and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene enhancers, Sp1 and myocyte-specific enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) were identified as cognate binding proteins that recognize these sites. Physical interactions between Sp1 and MEF-2 were demonstrated by immunological detection of both proteins in DNA binding complexes formed in vitro by nuclear extracts in the presence of only the A/T sequence motif, by coprecipitation of recombinant MEF-2 in the presence of a glutathione-S-transferase-Sp1 fusion protein bound to glutathione beads, and by a two-hybrid assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The interaction with Sp1 in vitro and in vivo is specific for MEF-2 and was not observed with serum response factor, a related MADS domain protein. Forced expression of Sp1 and MEF-2 in insect cells otherwise lacking these factors promotes synergistic transcriptional activation of a promoter containing binding sites for both proteins. These data expand the repertoire of functional and physical interactions between lineage-restricted (MEF-2) and ubiquitous (Sp1) transcription factors that may be important for myogenic differentiation.

transcriptional intermediary factor2	TIF2	Functional interactions of the AF-2 activation domain core region of the human androgen receptor with the amino-terminal domain and with the transcriptional coactivator TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor2).
ligand-binding domain	LBD	Previous studies in yeast and mammalian cells showed a functional interaction between the amino-terminal domain and the carboxy-terminal, ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the human androgen receptor (AR). In the present study, the AR subdomains involved in this in vivo interaction were determined in more detail. Cotransfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and two-hybrid experiments in yeast revealed that two regions in the NH2-terminal domain are involved in the functional interaction with the LBD: an interacting domain at the very NH2 terminus, located between amino acid residues 3 and 36, and a second domain, essential for transactivation, located between residues 370 and 494. Substitution of glutamic acid by glutamine at position 888 (E888Q) in the AF-2 activation domain (AD) core region in the LBD, markedly decreased the interaction with the NH2-terminal domain. This mutation neither influenced hormone binding nor LBD homodimerization, suggesting a role of the AF-2 AD core region in the functional interaction between the NH2-terminal domain and the LBD. The AF-2 AD core region was also involved in the interaction with the coactivator TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2), as the E888Q mutation decreased the stimulatory effect of TIF2 on AR AF-2 activity. Cotransfection of TIF2 and the AR NH2-terminal domain expression vectors did not result in synergy between both factors in the induction of AR AF-2 activity. TIF2 highly induced AR AF-2 activity on a complex promoter [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)], but it was hardly active on a minimal promoter (GRE-TATA). In contrast, the AR NH2-terminal domain induced AR AF-2 activity on both promoter constructs. These data indicate that both the AR NH2-terminal domain and the coactivator TIF2 functionally interact, either directly or indirectly, with the AF-2 AD core region in the AR-LBD, but the level of transcriptional response induced by TIF2 depends on the promoter context.

Cotransfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and two-hybrid experiments in yeast revealed that two regions in the NH2-terminal domain are involved in the functional interaction with the LBD: an interacting domain at the very NH2 terminus, located between amino acid residues 3 and 36, and a second domain, essential for transactivation, located between residues 370 and 494. Substitution of glutamic acid by glutamine at position 888 (E888Q) in the AF-2 activation domain (AD) core region in the LBD, markedly decreased the interaction with the NH2-terminal domain. This mutation neither influenced hormone binding nor LBD homodimerization, suggesting a role of the AF-2 AD core region in the functional interaction between the NH2-terminal domain and the LBD. The AF-2 AD core region was also involved in the interaction with the coactivator TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2), as the E888Q mutation decreased the stimulatory effect of TIF2 on AR AF-2 activity. Cotransfection of TIF2 and the AR NH2-terminal domain expression vectors did not result in synergy between both factors in the induction of AR AF-2 activity. TIF2 highly induced AR AF-2 activity on a complex promoter [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)], but it was hardly active on a minimal promoter (GRE-TATA). In contrast, the AR NH2-terminal domain induced AR AF-2 activity on both promoter constructs. These data indicate that both the AR NH2-terminal domain and the coactivator TIF2 functionally interact, either directly or indirectly, with the AF-2 AD core region in the AR-LBD, but the level of transcriptional response induced by TIF2 depends on the promoter context.

yeast TFIIS	yTFIIS	TFIIS is a general transcription elongation factor that helps arrested RNA polymerase II elongation complexes resume transcription. We have previously shown that yeast TFIIS (yTFIIS) comprises three structural domains (I-III). The three-dimensional structures of domain II and part of domain III have been previously reported, but neither domain can autonomously stimulate transcription elongation. Here we report the NMR structural analysis of residues 131-309 of yTFIIS which retains full activity and contains all of domains II and III. We confirm that the structure of domain II in the context of fully active yTFIIS is the same as that determined previously for a shorter construct. We have determined the structure of the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain of active yTFIIS and shown that it is similar to that reported for a shorter construct of human TFIIS. The region linking domain II with the zinc ribbon of domain III appears to be conformationally flexible and does not adopt a single defined tertiary structure. NMR analysis of inactive mutants of yTFIIS support a role for the linker region in interactions with the transcription elongation complex.
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs	ITAMs	The protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn (Fyn) plays important roles in both lymphocyte Ag receptor signaling and cytokinesis of proB cells. We utilized yeast two-hybrid cloning to identify the product of the tctex-1 gene as a protein that specifically interacts with Fyn, but not with other Src family kinases. Tctex-1 was recently identified as a component of the dynein cytoskeletal motor complex. The capacity of a Tctex-1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein to effectively bind Fyn from cell lysates confirmed the authenticity of this interaction. Tctex-1 binding required the first 19 amino acids of Fyn and integrity of two lysine residues within this sequence that were previously shown to be important for Fyn interactions with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of lymphocyte Ag receptors. Expression of tctex-1 mRNA and protein was observed in all lymphoma lines analyzed, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy localized the protein to the perinuclear region. Analysis of a T cell hybridoma revealed prominent colocalization of Tctex-1 and Fyn at the cleavage furrow and mitotic spindles in cells undergoing cytokinesis. Our results provide a unique insight into a mechanism by which Tctex-1 might mediate specific recruitment of Fyn to the dynein complex in lymphocytes, which may be a critical event in mediating the previously defined role of Fyn in cytokinesis.
temperature-sensitive-for-function	tsf	A genetic screen to isolate gene products required for vacuolar morphogenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified VAM7, a gene which encodes a protein containing a predicted coiled-coil domain homologous to the coiled-coil domain of the neuronal t-SNARE, SNAP-25 (Y. Wada and Y. Anraku, J. Biol. Chem. 267:18671-18675, 1992; T. Weimbs, S. H. Low, S. J. Chapin, K. E. Mostov, P. Bucher, and K. Hofmann, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:3046-3051, 1997). Analysis of a temperature-sensitive-for-function (tsf) allele of VAM7 (vam7(tsf)) demonstrated that the VAM7 gene product directly functions in vacuolar protein transport. vam7(tsf) mutant cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature displayed rapid defects in the delivery of multiple proteins that traffic to the vacuole via distinct biosynthetic pathways. Examination of vam7(tsf) cells at the nonpermissive temperature by electron microscopy revealed the accumulation of aberrant membranous compartments that may represent unfused transport intermediates. A fraction of Vam7p was localized to vacuolar membranes. Furthermore, VAM7 displayed genetic interactions with the vacuolar syntaxin homolog, VAM3. Consistent with the genetic results, Vam7p physically associated in a complex containing Vam3p, and this interaction was enhanced by inactivation of the yeast NSF (N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor) homolog, Sec18p. In addition to the coiled-coil domain, Vam7p also contains a putative NADPH oxidase p40(phox) (PX) domain. Changes in two conserved amino acids within this domain resulted in synthetic phenotypes when combined with the vam3(tsf) mutation, suggesting that the PX domain is required for Vam7p function. This study provides evidence for the functional and physical interaction between Vam7p and Vam3p at the vacuolar membrane, where they function as part of a t-SNARE complex required for the docking and/or fusion of multiple transport intermediates destined for the vacuole.

phosducin	Phd	PURPOSE: Retinal phosducin (Phd) and phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP1) selectively bind G-protein beta/gamma subunits (Gbetagamma). Our laboratory has recently identified two phosducin-like orphan proteins (PhLOP1 and PhLOP2) that lack the ability to interact with Gbetagamma. In search of potential functional protein partner(s) for these phosducin orphans, we examined their protein-protein interactions using a yeast two-hybrid screen. METHODS: A bovine retina yeast expression cDNA library was screened with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) fusion of PhLOP1. Quantitative analysis of the selected positives with PhLOP1 and other Phd isoforms was assessed by growth and beta-galactosidase activity. Further molecular, biochemical, and immunological detection methods utilizing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Phd isoform fusion proteins and the potential partner were also performed. RESULTS: A member of the superfamily of putative ATPases was selected in the yeast two hybrid screen. Further characterization identified a direct interaction of this putative ATPase with PhLOP1, as well as Phd and PhLP1, but not with PhLOP2. A database search verified this ATPase as a bovine orthologue of the yeast SUG1 (ySUG1), a putative transcriptional mediator and a subunit of the 26S proteasome complex. Our experiments reveal that the carboxy-terminus of PhLOP1 is essential for the protein-protein interaction with SUG1, but it alone is not sufficient to mediate SUG1 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these experimental results, Phd, PhLP1 and PhLOP1 have protein-protein interaction with SUG1. PhLOP1, a truncated amino-terminal splice variant of Phd, is the best candidate for the interaction with SUG1 among the four Phd isoforms studied, which suggests a potential function for PhLOP1.

transcription factors	TFs	To delineate the astronomical number of possible interactions of all genes in a genome is a task for which conventional experimental techniques are ill-suited. Sorely needed are rapid and inexpensive methods that identify candidates for interacting genes, candidates that can be further investigated by experiment. The subject of this paper is the application of a novel method to the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method applies to an important class of gene interactions, that is, transcriptional regulation via transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific enhancer or silencer sites on DNA. The method addresses the question: which of the genes in a genome are likely to be regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificity? It takes advantage of the fact that many TFs show cooperativity in transcriptional activation which manifests itself in closely spaced TF binding sites. Such "clusters" of binding sites are very unlikely to occur by chance alone, as opposed to individual sites, which are often abundant both in the genome and in promoter regions. Statistical information about binding site clusters in the genome, can be complemented by information about (i) known biochemical functions of the TF, (ii) the structure of its binding site, and (iii) function of the genes near the cluster, to identify genes likely to be regulated by a given transcription factor. Previously, binding sites of well characterized transcription factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. Here, the method is applied to a somewhat different situation: the yeast DNA binding activity yE2F, similar to the mammalian transcription factor E2F. yE2F has a DNA binding specificity identical to E2F, and its binding site shows UAS activity in a GAL1-based promoter construct. However, despite its high conservation, the in vivo function of yE2F is unknown. The analysis carried out the here suggests candidate genes for regulation by yE2F.
spindle pole body	SPB	The spindle pole body (SPB) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions as the microtubule-organizing center. Spc110p is an essential structural component of the SPB and spans between the central and inner plaques of this multilamellar organelle. The amino terminus of Spc110p faces the inner plaque, the substructure from which spindle microtubules radiate. We have undertaken a synthetic lethal screen to identify mutations that enhance the phenotype of the temperature-sensitive spc110-221 allele, which encodes mutations in the amino terminus. The screen identified mutations in SPC97 and SPC98, two genes encoding components of the Tub4p complex in yeast. The spc98-63 allele is synthetic lethal only with spc110 alleles that encode mutations in the N terminus of Spc110p. In contrast, the spc97 alleles are synthetic lethal with spc110 alleles that encode mutations in either the N terminus or the C terminus. Using the two-hybrid assay, we show that the interactions of Spc110p with Spc97p and Spc98p are not equivalent. The N terminus of Spc110p displays a robust interaction with Spc98p in two different two-hybrid assays, while the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p is not detectable in one strain and gives a weak signal in the other. Extra copies of SPC98 enhance the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p, while extra copies of SPC97 interfere with the interaction between Spc98p and Spc110p. By testing the interactions between mutant proteins, we show that the lethal phenotype in spc98-63 spc110-221 cells is caused by the failure of Spc98-63p to interact with Spc110-221p. In contrast, the lethal phenotype in spc97-62 spc110-221 cells can be attributed to a decreased interaction between Spc97-62p and Spc98p. Together, these studies provide evidence that Spc110p directly links the Tub4p complex to the SPB. Moreover, an interaction between Spc98p and the amino-terminal region of Spc110p is a critical component of the linkage, whereas the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p is dependent on Spc98p.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	Protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus involves specific uptake into coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles of secretory and of vesicle targeting (v-SNARE) proteins. Here, two ER to Golgi v-SNAREs, Bet1p and Bos1p, were shown to interact specifically with Sar1p, Sec23p, and Sec24p, components of the COPII coat, in a guanine nucleotide-dependent fashion. Other v-SNAREs, Sec22p and Ykt6p, might interact more weakly with the COPII coat or interact indirectly by binding to Bet1p or Bos1p. The data suggest that transmembrane proteins can be taken up into COPII vesicles by direct interactions with the coat proteins and may play a structural role in the assembly of the COPII coat complex.

green fluorescent protein	GFP	Dual hybrid interacting screening in yeast led to the identification of two proteins from Arabidopsis both exhibiting sequence similarity to a family of transcriptional coactivators from a diverse range of organisms. Their discovery constitutes the first description of such plant proteins. A modified yeast two-hybrid approach utilising the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequora victoria was developed and used to clone one of the putative plant transcriptional coactivators from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. The two proteins, designated KIWI and KELP, can associate both hetero- and homomerically and their genes were cloned and mapped on the Arabidopsis genome. Both proteins are believed to play a role in gene activation during pathogen defence and plant development. The involvement of these proteins in general plant transcription as well as the advantages of using GFP as a reporter gene for detecting protein-protein interactions are discussed.
arf1-3	ARF1	Arf proteins are ubiquitous, eukaryotic regulators of virtually every step of vesicular membrane traffic. ADP-ribosylation factors are essential in yeast and the lethality resulting from either overexpression or underexpression (deletion) of Arf genes has previously been ascribed to dysregulation of the secretory process. We have identified a family of four genes (Suppressors of Arf ts, SAT) as high copy suppressors of a loss of function allele of ARF1 (arf1-3). Those proteins with SAT activity were found to contain a minimal consensus motif, including a C2C2H2 cluster with a novel and specific spacing. Genetic interactions between members of this family and with ARF1 are consistent with each sharing a common cellular pathway. Included in this family is Gcs1, a protein previously described (Poon, P. P., Wang, X., Rotman, M., Huber, I., Cukierman, E., Cassel, D., Singer, R. A., and Johnston, G. C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 10074-10077) to possess Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, demonstrating a direct interaction between Arf and at least one of these suppressors. The suppression of the loss of Arf function by overexpression of Gcs1 and demonstration of direct, preferential binding of Gcs1 to the activated form of Arf (Arf.GTP) lead us to conclude that the biological role of Gcs1 is as an effector of the essential function of Arf in mitotic growth, rather than a down-regulator as implied by the biochemical (Arf GAP) activity. Suppression of the growth defect of arf1(-3) cells was observed under conditions that did not alter the secretory defect associated with arf1(-) mutation, indicating that the essential role of Arf in eukaryotes can be distinguished from role(s) in the secretory pathway and appear to employ distinct pathways and effectors.

heat shock transcription factor	CTR	The C-terminal hydrophobic repeat (CTR) of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) has been proposed to regulate DNA binding by intramolecular interactions with the leucine zipper motifs present in the HSF trimerization domain. Schizosaccharomyces pombe provides a useful model organism for the study of the regulation of HSF DNA binding because, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. pombe hsf is highly heat shock inducible for DNA binding and contains a clear homology to the CTR. We examined the role that the CTR plays in the regulation of S. pombe hsf by constructing isogenic strains bearing deletion and point mutations in the chromosomal copy of hsf. Surprisingly, we found that point mutation of key hydrophobic amino acids within the CTR, as well as full deletion of it, yielded factors that show normal binding at normal growth temperatures and full levels of heat-induced binding. Deletion of the CTR did, however, slightly lower the temperature required for maximal activation. In contrast, a large deletion of the C-terminus, which removes close to a third of the coding sequence, was deregulated and bound DNA at control temperature. Several of the deletion mutants were significantly reduced in their level of expression, yet they showed wild-type levels of DNA binding activity following heat shock. These experiments demonstrate that appropriate regulation of the DNA binding activity of S. pombe hsf is not solely dependent upon the CTR, and imply that a feedback mechanism exists that establishes proper levels of DNA binding following heat shock despite mutations that significantly alter levels of total hsf.

aryl hydrocarbon receptor	Ahr	The pBEVY (bi-directional expression vectors for yeast) plasmids were designed with constitutive and galactose-induced bi-directional promoters to direct the expression of multiple proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Using human estrogen receptor as a test gene, relatively balanced expression levels from each side of a bi-directional promoter were observed. Expression of a functional heterodimeric transcription factor composed of human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) proteins was accomplished using a single pBEVY plasmid. Previous studies suggest that inhibitory cross-talk between the estrogen receptor and the Ahr/Arnt complex may occur and that Hsp90-Ahr complex formation is important for Ahr-mediated signal transduction. Evidence for functional interaction among these proteins was investigated using pBEVY plasmids in a yeast system. No inhibitory cross-talk was observed in signaling assays performed with yeast that co-expressed Ahr, Arnt and estrogen receptor. In contrast, Ahr/Arnt-mediated signal transduction was reduced by 80% in a temperature-sensitive Hsp90 strain grown under non-permissive conditions. We conclude that pBEVY plasmids facilitate the examination of multiple protein interactions in yeast model systems.

immediate-early	IE	Both of the major immediate-early (IE) proteins IE1 and IE2 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as well as input viral DNA and sites of viral IE transcription colocalize with or adjacent to punctate PML domains (PML oncogenic domains [PODs] or nuclear domain 10) in the nucleus within the first few hours after infection of permissive human fibroblasts. However, colocalization of IE1 and PML in PODs is only transient, with both proteins subsequently redistributing into a nuclear diffuse form. These processes are believed to promote efficient viral IE transcription and initiation of DNA synthesis especially at low multiplicities of infection. To examine the mechanism of PML displacement by IE1, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assay experiments with plasmids expressing intact or deleted forms of PML and IE1 in DNA-transfected cells. The results demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal acidic region of IE1 uncouples the requirements for displacement of both endogenous and coexpressed PML from those needed to target to the PODs. Mutant PML proteins containing either a Cys point mutation within the N-terminal RING finger domain or a small deletion (of positions 281 to 304) within the coiled-coil region did not localize to the PODs but instead gave a nuclear diffuse distribution, similar to that produced by intact PML in the presence of IE1. Endogenous PML also colocalized with IE1 in metaphase chromosomes in HCMV or recombinant adenovirus type 5-IE1-infected HF cells undergoing mitosis, implying that there may be a direct physical interaction between IE1 and PML. Indeed, a specific interaction between IE1 and PML was observed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of IE2 with the retinoblastoma protein. The RING finger mutant form of PML showed a threefold-lower interaction with IE1 in the yeast system, and deletion of the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML abolished the interaction. Consistent with the IFA results, a mutant IE1 protein that lacks the C-terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PML in the yeast system. The two-hybrid interaction assay also showed that both the N-terminal RING finger domain and the intact coiled-coil region of PML are required cooperatively for efficient self-interactions involving dimerization or oligomerization. Furthermore, truncated or deleted GAL4/PML fusion proteins that retained the RING finger domain but lacked the intact coiled-coil region displayed an unmasked cryptic transactivator function in both yeast and mammalian cells, and the RING finger mutation abolished this transactivation property of PML. Therefore, we suggest that a direct interaction between IE1 and the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML may inhibit oligomerization and protein-protein complex formation by PML, leading to displacement of PML and IE1 from the PODs, and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PML.

eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3	eIF3	Only five of the nine subunits of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) have recognizable homologs encoded in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, and only two of these (Prt1p and Tif34p) were identified previously as subunits of yeast eIF3. We purified a polyhistidine-tagged form of Prt1p (His-Prt1p) by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography and obtained a complex of approximately 600 kDa composed of six polypeptides whose copurification was completely dependent on the polyhistidine tag on His-Prt1p. All five polypeptides associated with His-Prt1p were identified by mass spectrometry, and four were found to be the other putative homologs of human eIF3 subunits encoded in S. cerevisiae: YBR079c/Tif32p, Nip1p, Tif34p, and YDR429c/Tif35p. The fifth Prt1p-associated protein was eIF5, an initiation factor not previously known to interact with eIF3. The purified complex could rescue Met-tRNAiMet binding to 40S ribosomes in defective extracts from a prt1 mutant or extracts from which Nip1p had been depleted, indicating that it possesses a known biochemical activity of eIF3. These findings suggest that Tif32p, Nip1p, Prt1p, Tif34p, and Tif35p comprise an eIF3 core complex, conserved between yeast and mammals, that stably interacts with eIF5. Nip1p bound to eIF5 in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro protein binding assays. Interestingly, Sui1p also interacts with Nip1p, and both eIF5 and Sui1p have been implicated in accurate recognition of the AUG start codon. Thus, eIF5 and Sui1p may be recruited to the 40S ribosomes through physical interactions with the Nip1p subunit of eIF3.

endoplasmic reticulum	ER	Three previously identified genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, VMA12, VMA21, and VMA22, encode proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These three proteins are required for the biogenesis of a functional vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), but are not part of the final enzyme complex. Subcellular fractionation and chemical cross-linking studies have revealed that Vma12p and Vma22p form a stable membrane associated complex. Cross-linking analysis also revealed a direct physical interaction between the Vma12p/Vma22p assembly complex and Vph1p, the 100-kD integral membrane subunit of the V-ATPase. The interaction of the Vma12p/Vma22p complex with Vph1p was transient (half-life of approximately 5 min), reflecting trafficking of this V-ATPase subunit through the ER en route to the vacuolar membrane. Analysis of these protein-protein interactions in ER-blocked sec12 mutant cells indicated that the Vph1p-Vma12p/Vma22p interactions are quite stable when transport of the V-ATPase out of the ER is blocked. Fractionation of solubilized membrane proteins on a density gradient revealed comigration of Vma22p and Vma12p, indicating that they form a complex even in the absence of cross-linker. Vma12p and Vma22p migrated to fractions separate from Vma21p. Loss of Vph1p caused the Vma12p/Vma22p complex to sediment to less dense fractions, consistent with association of Vma12p/ Vma22p with nascent Vph1p in ER membranes. This is the first evidence for a dedicated assembly complex in the ER required for the assembly of an integral membrane protein complex (V-ATPase) as it is transported through the secretory pathway.

eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3	eIF3	The PRT1, TIF34, GCD10, and SUI1 proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found previously to copurify with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) activity. Although TIF32, NIP1, and TIF35 are homologous to subunits of human eIF3, they were not known to be components of the yeast factor. We detected interactions between PRT1, TIF34, and TIF35 by the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro binding assays. Discrete segments (70-150 amino acids) of PRT1 and TIF35 were found to be responsible for their binding to TIF34. Temperature-sensitive mutations mapping in WD-repeat domains of TIF34 were isolated that decreased binding between TIF34 and TIF35 in vitro. The lethal effect of these mutations was suppressed by increasing TIF35 gene dosage, suggesting that the TIF34-TIF35 interaction is important for TIF34 function in translation. Pairwise in vitro interactions were also detected between PRT1 and TIF32, TIF32 and NIP1, and NIP1 and SUI1. Furthermore, PRT1, NIP1, TIF34, TIF35, and a polypeptide with the size of TIF32 were specifically coimmunoprecipitated from the ribosomal salt wash fraction. We propose that all five yeast proteins homologous to human eIF3 subunits are components of a stable heteromeric complex in vivo and may comprise the conserved core of yeast eIF3.
p21-activated kinases	PAKs	p21-activated kinases (PAKs) bind to and are activated by Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac. Since these GTPases play key roles in regulating cell polarity, stress responses, and cell cycle progression, the ability of PAK to affect these processes has been examined. We previously showed that fission yeast pak1+ encodes an essential protein that affects mating and cell polarity. Here, we characterize a second pak gene (pak2+) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Cla4p and Skm1p, fission yeast Pak2p contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain in addition to a p21-binding domain and a protein kinase domain that are common to other members of the PAK family. Unlike pak1+, pak2(+) is not essential for vegetative growth or for mating in S. pombe. Overexpression of the wild-type pak2+ allele suppresses the lethal growth defect associated with deletion of pak1+, and this suppression requires both the pleckstrin homology- and the p21-binding domains of Pak2p, as well as kinase activity. A substantial fraction of Pak2p is associated with membranous components, an association mediated both by the pleckstrin homology- and by the p21-binding domains. These results show that S. pombe encodes at least two pak genes with distinct functions and suggest that the membrane localization of Pak2p, directed by its interactions with membrane lipids and Cdc42p, is critical to its biological activity.
human immunodeficiency virus type 1	HIV-1	We have used the yeast three-hybrid system (D. J. SenGupta, B. Zhang, B. Kraemer, P. Pochart, S. Fields, and M. Wickens, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8496-8501, 1996) to study binding of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein to the HIV-1 RNA encapsidation signal (HIVPsi). Interaction of these elements results in the activation of a reporter gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this system, we have shown that the HIV-1 Gag protein binds specifically to a 139-nucleotide fragment of the HIVPsi signal containing four stem-loop structures. Mutations in either the Gag protein or the encapsidation signal that have been shown previously to impair this interaction reduced the activation of the reporter gene. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid portion of Gag retained the RNA binding activity but lost its specificity compared to the full-length Gag. These results demonstrate the utility of this system and suggest that a variety of genetic analyses could be performed to study Gag-encapsidation signal interactions.

RNA polymerase	RNAP	The 2.5 angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) alpha subunit amino-terminal domain (alphaNTD), which is necessary and sufficient to dimerize and assemble the other RNAP subunits into a transcriptionally active enzyme and contains all of the sequence elements conserved among eukaryotic alpha homologs, has been determined. The alphaNTD monomer comprises two distinct, flexibly linked domains, only one of which participates in the dimer interface. In the alphaNTD dimer, a pair of helices from one monomer interact with the cognate helices of the other to form an extensive hydrophobic core. All of the determinants for interactions with the other RNAP subunits lie on one face of the alphaNTD dimer. Sequence alignments, combined with secondary-structure predictions, support proposals that a heterodimer of the eukaryotic RNAP subunits related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb3 and Rpb11 plays the role of the alphaNTD dimer in prokaryotic RNAP.

recombinant leech-derived tryptase inhibitor	rLDTI	The production of recombinant leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (rLDTI) by two different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the secretion of non-glycosylated and glycosylated rLTDI. Monosaccharide analysis and a-mannosidase treatment demonstrated that glycosylated rLDTI was exclusively alpha-mannosylated. A trypsin digest of reduced and S-carboxymethylated glycosylated rLDTI was separated on a reverse-phase HPLC column. Glycopeptides identified by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, amino acid sequence analysis, and monosaccharide analysis revealed the presence of different glycoforms. It was found that Ser24, Ser33 and Ser36 were partially glycosylated with a single mannose residue, whereas Thr42 in glycosylated rLDTI from both strains was fully occupied with manno-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization ranging over 1-3 and 1-13 depending on the yeast strain. In phosphorylated rLDTI a single phosphate group was predominantly located at the innermost Man residue of units of mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose and mannopentaose at Thr42. Oligosaccharides released by alkaline treatment were reduced by sodium borohydride and separated by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography on a CarboPac MA1 column, and analyzed by one- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Besides the major oligosaccharide Man alpha1-2Man-ol, the (for yeast protein O-glycosylation) unusual Man alpha1-3Man alpha1-2Man-ol was determined. The solution conformation of glycosylated rLDTI was investigated by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Structure calculations by means of distance geometry showed that glycosylated rLDTI is compactly folded and contained small secondary structure elements. Analysis of the chemical shifts showed that amino acids Val32-Ser33, Ser36-Ser39 and Thr42 were affected by the O-mannosylation. In addition, changes in chemical shift were observed within the beta-hairpin peptide regions Val13-Ser16 and Gly18-Tyr21 attributed to direct interactions of the mannose residue at Ser36. Furthermore, the protein-linked oligosaccharides were spatially grouped in a position opposite of the canonical binding loop.
BFR2 gene product	Bfr2p	The essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene BFR2 has been isolated as a high-copy suppressor of the growth defects induced by Brefeldin A, a drug that disrupts the Golgi apparatus and its protein influx. Furthermore, BFR2 has been found to display genetic interactions with four mutations affecting protein transport to the Golgi apparatus. Here we show that the level of BFR2 mRNA rapidly increased over fivefold in response to cold shock, and over threefold following nutrient replenishment by dilution of cells from exhausted to fresh minimal medium. During subsequent growth, the transcript level returned to its basal values, except for a transient drop toward the end of the exponential phase. The early burst of transcription was not caused by toxic compounds in the fresh medium, or by synchrony among cells that had simultaneously entered their first cell cycle. The BFR2 gene product (Bfr2p) was synthesized following the early burst of mRNA, and was no longer produced when the mRNA was back to basal level. Bfr2p was finally degraded after growth became limited, and reached undetectable levels in exhausted medium. Under steady-state conditions of lengthened exponential phase, the intracellular level of Bfr2p remained constant. This peculiar pattern of gene expression suggests that Bfr2p is essential for mass growth or cell proliferation, whereas it is either toxic or not required during nutrient-limited growth.
nonstructural	NS	The rotavirus genome encodes six nonstructural (NS) proteins, five of which (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP5, and NSP6) have been suggested to be involved in a variety of events, such as genome replication, regulation of gene expression, and gene assortment. These NS proteins have been found to be associated with replication complexes that are precursors of the viral core, however, little information is available about the intermolecular interactions that may exist among them. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, which allows the detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo, all possible combinations among the rotavirus NS proteins were tested, and several interactions were observed. NSP1 interacted with the other four proteins tested; NSP3 associated with itself; and NSP5 was found to form homodimers and to interact with NSP6. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins from rotavirus-infected cells, using hyperimmune sera monospecific for the NS proteins, showed the same interactions for NSP1 as those observed in yeast. Immunofluorescence co-localization analysis of virus-infected epithelial cells revealed that the intracellular distribution of proteins that were seen to interact in yeast had patterns of distribution that would allow such intermolecular interactions to occur. These findings should contribute to the understanding of the role these proteins play in different aspects of the virus replication cycle.
Phosphoinositolglycan-peptide	PIG-P	Phosphoinositolglycan molecules isolated from insulin-sensitive mammalian tissues have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies to exert partial insulin-mimetic activity on glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-sensitive cells. However, their ill-defined structures, heterogeneous nature, and limited availability have prohibited the analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism. Phosphoinositolglycan-peptide (PIG-P) of defined and homogeneous structure prepared in large scale from the core glycan of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has recently been shown to stimulate glucose transport as well as a number of glucose-metabolizing enzymes and pathways to up to 90% (at 2 to 10 microns) of the maximal insulin effect in isolated rat adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, and diaphragms (G. Muller et al., 1997, Endocrinology 138: 3459-3476). Consequently, we used this PIG-P for the present study in which we compare its intracellular signaling with that of insulin. The activation of glucose transport by both PIG-P and insulin in isolated rat adipocytes and diaphragms was found to require stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase but to be independent of functional p70S6kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. The increase in glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in rat adipocytes in response to PIG-P and insulin was dependent on both PI 3-kinase and p70S6kinase. This suggest that the signaling pathways for PIG-P and insulin to glucose transport and metabolism converage at the level of PI 3-kinase. A component of the PIG-P signaling pathway located up-stream of PI 3-kinase was identified by desensitization of isolated rat adipocytes for PIG-P action by combined treatment with trypsin and NaCl under conditions that preserved cell viability and the insulin-mimetic activity of sodium vanadate but completely blunted the insulin response. Incubation of the cells with either trypsin or NaCl alone was ineffective. The desensitized adipocytes were reconstituted for stimulation of lipogenesis by PIG-P by addition of the concentrated trypsin/salt extract. The reconstituted adipocytes exhibited 65-75% of the maximal PIG-P response and similar EC50 values for PIG-P (2 to 5 microns) compared with control cells. A proteinaceous N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive component contained in the trypsin/salt extract was demonstrated to bind in a functional manner to the adipocyte plasma membrane of desensitized adipocytes via bipolar interactions. An excess of trypsin/salt extract inhibited PIG-P action in untreated adipocytes in a competitive fashion compatible with a receptor function for PIG-P of this protein. The presence of the putative PIG-P receptor protein in detergent-insoluble complexes prepared from isolated rat adipocytes suggests that caveolae/detergent-insoluble complexes of the plasma membrane may play a role in insulin-mimetic signaling by PIG-P. Furthermore, treatment of isolated rat diaphragms and adipocytes with PIG-P as well as with other agents exerting partially insulin-mimetic activity, such as PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and the sulfonylurea glimepiride, triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the caveolar marker protein caveolin, which was apparently correlated with stimulation of lipogenesis. Strikingly, in adipocytes subjected to combined trypsin/salt treatment, PIG-P, PI-specific PLC, and glimepiride failed completely to provoke insulin-mimetic effects. A working model is presented for a signaling pathway in insulin-sensitive cells used by PIG(-P) molecules which involves GPI structures, the trypsin/salt- and NEM-sensitive receptor protein for PIG-P, and additional proteins located in caveolae/detergent-insoluble complexes.

yeast trimeric single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A	RPA	The RFA1 gene encodes the large subunit of the yeast trimeric single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA), which is known to play a critical role in DNA replication. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying the rfa1-44 allele displays a number of impaired recombination and repair phenotypes, all of which are suppressible by overexpression of RAD52. We demonstrate that a rad52 mutation is epistatic to the rfa1-44 mutation, placing RFA1 and RAD52 in the same genetic pathway. Furthermore, two-hybrid analysis indicates the existence of interactions between Rad52 and all three subunits of RPA. The nature of this Rad52-RPA interaction was further explored by using two different mutant alleles of rad52. Both mutations lie in the amino terminus of Rad52, a region previously defined as being responsible for its DNA binding ability (U. H. Mortenson, C. Beudixen, I. Sunjeuaric, and R. Rothstein, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:10729-10734, 1996). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to monitor the protein-protein interactions of the mutant Rad52 proteins. Both of the mutant proteins are capable of self-interaction but are unable to interact with Rad51. The mutant proteins also lack the ability to interact with the large subunit of RPA, Rfa1. Interestingly, they retain their ability to interact with the medium-sized subunit, Rfa2. Given the location of the mutations in the DNA binding domain of Rad52, a model incorporating the role of DNA in the protein-protein interactions involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks is presented.
ribosomal DNA	rDNA	Previous in vitro studies have shown that initiation of transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves an interaction of upstream activation factor (UAF) with the upstream element of the promoter, forming a stable UAF-template complex; together with TATA-binding protein (TBP), UAF then recruits an essential factor, core factor (CF), to the promoter, forming a stable preinitiation complex. TBP interacts with both UAF and CF in vitro. In addition, a subunit of UAF, Rrn9p, interacts with TBP in vitro and in the two-hybrid system, suggesting the possible importance of this interaction for UAF function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified three mutations in RRN9 that abolish the interaction of Rrn9p with TBP without affecting its interaction with Rrn10p, another subunit of UAF. Yeast cells containing any one of these individual mutations, L110S, L269P, or L274Q, did not show any growth defects. However, cells containing a combination of L110S with one of the other two mutations showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, and this phenotype was suppressed by fusing the mutant genes to SPT15, which encodes TBP. In addition, another mutation (F186S), which disrupts both Rrn9p-TBP and Rrn9p-Rrn10p interactions in the two-hybrid system, abolished UAF function in vivo, and this mutational defect was suppressed by fusion of the mutant gene to SPT15 combined with overexpression of Rrn10p. These experiments demonstrate that the interaction of UAF with TBP, which is presumably achieved by the interaction of Rrn9p with TBP, is indeed important for high-level transcription of rDNA by RNA polymerase I in vivo.

mitochondrial actin binding protein(s)	mABP	Transfer of mitochondria to daughter cells during yeast cell division is essential for viable progeny. The actin cytoskeleton is required for this process, potentially as a track to direct mitochondrial movement into the bud. Sedimentation assays reveal two different components required for mitochondria-actin interactions: (1) mitochondrial actin binding protein(s) (mABP), a peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane protein(s) with ATP-sensitive actin binding activity, and (2) a salt-inextractable, presumably integral, membrane protein(s) required for docking of mABP on the organelle. mABP activity is abolished by treatment of mitochondria with high salt. Addition of either the salt-extracted mitochondrial peripheral membrane proteins (SE), or a protein fraction with ATP-sensitive actin-binding activity isolated from SE, to salt-washed mitochondria restores this activity. mABP docking activity is saturable, resistant to high salt, and inhibited by pre-treatment of salt-washed mitochondria with papain. Two integral mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, Mmm1p (Burgess, S.M., M. Delannoy, and R.E. Jensen. 1994. J.Cell Biol. 126:1375-1391) and Mdm10p, (Sogo, L.F., and M.P. Yaffe. 1994. J.Cell Biol. 126:1361- 1373) are required for these actin-mitochondria interactions. Mitochondria isolated from an mmm1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant or from an mdm10 deletion mutant show no mABP activity and no mABP docking activity. Consistent with this, mitochondrial motility in vivo in mmm1-1 and mdm10Delta mutants appears to be actin independent. Depolymerization of F-actin using latrunculin-A results in loss of long-distance, linear movement and a fivefold decrease in the velocity of mitochondrial movement. Mitochondrial motility in mmm1-1 and mdm10Delta mutants is indistinguishable from that in latrunculin-A-treated wild-type cells. We propose that Mmm1p and Mdm10p are required for docking of mABP on the surface of yeast mitochondria and coupling the organelle to the actin cytoskeleton.
endoplasmic reticulum	ER	We previously identified BET3 by its genetic interactions with BET1, a gene whose SNARE-like product acts in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport. To gain insight into the function of Bet3p, we added three c-myc tags to its C-terminus and immunopurified this protein from a clarified detergent extract. Here we report that Bet3p is a member of a large complex ( approximately 800 kDa) that we call TRAPP (transport protein particle). We propose that TRAPP plays a key role in the targeting and/or fusion of ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles with their acceptor compartment. The localization of Bet3p to the cis-Golgi complex, as well as biochemical studies showing that Bet3p functions on this compartment, support this hypothesis. TRAPP contains at least nine other constituents, five of which have been identified and shown to be highly conserved novel proteins.

Tropomyosins	TMs	Tropomyosins (TMs) are highly conserved, coiled-coil, actin binding regulatory proteins found in most eukaryotic cells. The amino-terminal domain of 284-residue TMs is among the most conserved and functionally important regions. The first nine residues are proposed to bind to the carboxyl-terminal nine residues to form the "overlap" region between successive TMs, which bind along the actin filament. Here, the structure of the N-terminus of muscle alpha-TM, in a chimeric peptide, TMZip, has been solved using circular dichroism (CD) and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (2D 1H NMR) spectroscopy. Residues 1-14 of TMZip are the first 14 N-terminal residues of rabbit striated alpha-TM, and residues 15-32 of TMZip are the last 18 C-terminal residues of the yeast GCN4 transcription factor. CD measurements show that TMZip forms a two-stranded coiled-coil alpha-helix with an enthalpy of folding of -34 +/- 2 kcal/mol. In 2D1H NMR studies at 15 degrees C, pH 6.4, the peptide exhibits 123 sequential and medium range intrachain NOE cross peaks per chain, characteristic of alpha-helices extending from residue 1 to residue 29, together with 85 long-range NOE cross peaks arising from interchain interactions. The three-dimensional structure of TMZip has been determined using these data plus an additional 509 intrachain constraints per chain. The coiled-coil domain extends to the N-terminus. Amide hydrogen exchange studies, however, suggest that the TM region is less stable than the GCN4 region. The work reported here is the first atomic-resolution structure of any region of TM and it allows insight into the mechanism of the function of the highly conserved N-terminal domain.

The three-dimensional structure of TMZip has been determined using these data plus an additional 509 intrachain constraints per chain. The coiled-coil domain extends to the N-terminus. Amide hydrogen exchange studies, however, suggest that the TM region is less stable than the GCN4 region. The work reported here is the first atomic-resolution structure of any region of TM and it allows insight into the mechanism of the function of the highly conserved N-terminal domain.
signal transducers and activators of transcription	Stats	Many cytokine receptors employ Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) for nuclear signaling. Here, we have established yeast strains in which an autoactivated Jak2 kinase induces tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of a concomitantly expressed Stat5 protein. Transcriptional activity of Stat5 on a stably integrated, Stat-dependent reporter gene required the C-terminal fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain. In such yeast strains, the interaction between Jak2 and Stat5 was analyzed without interference by other mammalian proteins involved in regulating Jak-Stat signaling, and mutant versions of both proteins were analyzed for their ability to productively interact. Complexes between Jak2 and Stat5 were found to be stable under stringent co-immunoprecipitation conditions. Deletion of the Jak homology regions 2-7 (JH2-JH7) of Jak2, leaving only the kinase domain (JH1) intact, reduced the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate Stat5, whereas deletion of the JH2 domain caused an increased enzymatic activity. A site-directed R618K mutation in the Stat5 SH2 domain abolished the phosphorylation by Jak2, while deletion of the C terminus led to Stat5 hyperphosphorylation. A single phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction was sufficient for the dimerization of Stat5, but such dimers bound to DNA very inefficiently. Together, our data show that yeast cells are appropriate tools for studying Jak-Stat or Stat-Stat interactions. Our mutational analysis suggests that the Stat5 SH2 domain is essential for the interaction with Jak2 and that the kinase domain of Jak2 is sufficient for Jak2-Stat5 interaction. Therefore, the Jak kinase domain may be all that is needed to cause Stat phosphorylation in situations where receptor docking is dispensable.
